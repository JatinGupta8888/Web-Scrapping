Go for it; Amazing lens; This lens is too good, i am able to capture moon pics also, perfect for portraits, Great lens.; It's a Best product which made my photography fulfilled which I didn't get in the basic lens; This is best in all aspects. Zoom , blur, etc
Best for normal photo and video shoot.üëç; Worth for price; Help me to return this item ‡•§ thank you; Cheap rate,but no image stabilization,so picture won't come good as expected.; This camera lens is amazing! It‚Äôs a little bit heavier than most lenses but totally worth it considering that you can do some pictures that are semi close-up but also zoom in and get GREAT quality pictures! At this point, this has to be my favorite lens for photographing families and young children! You won‚Äôt go wrong purchasing this lens for your photo sessions!; Bueno bonito y barato me encanto; There was a tiny piece of dust that was inside the lens (visible on right side in pics) that I didn't notice until after I took my photos, but I had it replaced super quickly and easily which is great support, and the new one is perfect.

This is a great beginner/budget zoom lens that is a big upgrade from the included kit lens on the Rebel T7. For the price, it does the job very well. The focal range covers a decent amount and I have only tested it at an air show, but it does make you work for the shot. Great value lens.

Some drawbacks though is that there is no image stabilization, and the autofocus can be pretty slow and get confused especially on faster moving objects. I already expected those issues, since you get what you pay for, but for something that isn't the USM or higher end lenses it did way better than I thought it would. I had to use manual focus a fair bit so I missed some shots, but the ones I managed to get turned out way better than I expected.

Overall for the price it is a great buy, especially if you plan on photographing slower/still subjects. For practice or casual/hobby photography this is a perfect starter for using telephoto/zoom lenses. I plan to try it on wildlife which may be easier than fast moving planes.; Chegou bem antes do prazo e bem embalada. Estava previsto para chegar entre dia 11 a 22 de agosto e chegou hoje, dia 24/07. Ainda n√£o consegui experimentar direito, mas aparentemente √© boa, est√° tudo funcionando direito. Espero que continue assim.; It‚Äôs overall a great lens, came in great packaging. It does have a little crack on the lens, as shown in the picture, but it is refurbished. Great zoom. Very crisp image. Overall, it‚Äôs a very good lens and I would definitely recommend it. Although it is only good for zooming."

By mistake purchased a pancake lens SEL16F28 which although does the job is poor at portrait shots and macro because of a fixed lens assembly. So I went ahead and bought this telephoto lens and man was I blown!!! Some sample shots are there for your review. The only con I could point is the slow autofocus but once it identifies the subject, sbilization is just awesome!!!! Shows that even though hardware is dated but the lenses make a lot of difference!!! üòçüòçüòç; Bought it for my A7C. Using it with APSC mode turned on. Very sharp and nice. Bang for buck lens if u don‚Äôt care about the resolution of the image.; This lense is light weight black colored professional and handi.; Good len with great zoom; A moon shot with the same lens on Sony Alpha zv-e10. I have made some minor edits to the image.

The lens is good. You can watch some video samples on my channel @dcpsir.

The packaging was okay. I wish the sellers could see how the packages are thrown on the ground by the delivery agents. Then they will start doing even safer packaging.

Cons:
The lens description says the aperture is a perfectly circular one to give a good bokeh effect. However, the aperture in my lens is an uneven polygon, and the shape becomes very weird on zooming. I don't know if it is a manufacturing defect. The replacement process is very difficult as it is not allowing me to create a replacement directly. I talked to Amazon people, and they have promised to create a replacement within 48 hours, but I don't know. I am about to buy a couple more lenses, but that depends on how amazon helps me with this one. Shall update my experience.

I am back with an update as promised:
I didn't see any replacement order being created till today and contacted customer service again. After 30 minutes of discussing with two different persons, I was informed of one interesting thing: the replacement policy for electronic items has changed, and we cannot create replacement from our end!!!
Really! Shouldn't they inform the customer beforehand what the policies are?
My take: Don't buy anything expensive online.; Its an amazing lens, go for it!! The standard lens of 18-55mm is just not enough for the sony alpha. But if can shell a bit more you can check out the 70-300mm lens by Tamron as well. But this one is definitely worth every penny!; || Tested on full frame mirrorless camera (Sony A7III) ||
It's a lens for APS-C format dslr/mirrrorless camera. So if you're buying it for using it on a full frame body, you have to know you will not get the full resolution picture of your camera, you'll get a cropped resolution image as it is an APS-C format lens. So, before complaining about the image quality, you have to know this well known fact. Now, if you use it on an APS-C body, you'll get pretty good images with full resolution. I'm happy with the image quality. The auto focus is also great! If you like to take photos occasionally as a hobby like me, then you'll be happy with the lens, but if you're a professional photographer, you should opt for better quality Sony G Master lens which is 5-6 times higher the cost. I didn't have much time to spend with this lens. So, I'm sharing 3 images which I've taken yesterday. I will try to update this review with more images in future if possible. [Updated]
If you use it on your Sony A7iii, you'll get 10MP images or 24MP images with black corners.; I purchased a Sony a6000 3 years ago and have been examining lenses ever since. One of the main issues with the Sony camera range is the cost of the lenses- which leads me to this review!
This lens is the standard kit lens that goes with older camera models of this type and with the price, you can‚Äôt go far wrong.
It‚Äôs not the best lens in the world- the picture I‚Äôve taken have all been pretty good. If you are looking for a cheap, budget zoom lens for the alpha cameras I would recommend this.; Me gusta mucho este objetivo. Tiene una buena calidad √≥ptica con poca, o dir√≠a que nula deformaci√≥n de la imagen. La velocidad de enfoque es muy r√°pida, mucho mejor que objetivos Nikon o Cannon al menos en c√°maras b√°sicas. En modo AF es silencioso y hasta ahora no he tenido problemas de ruido al grabar video. Es muy ligero y compacto. Ideal para el uso de c√°maras Sony sin espejo con sensor de formato cmos peque√±o. Ideal para viajar. Recomendable comprarle un filtro uv o skyly para proteger la lente frontal. Seria ideal que contara con una bolsa de transporte. Muy buena relaci√≥n precio calidad.; Easy to use and was a great addition for taking wildlife photos while in Antarctica. Would definitely recommend for the price!; No voy a descubrir nada de este objetivo para la c√°mara Sony.

I have to state they for the price, this is one of the best I have ever seen which will take your mobile photography to a completely different level. If instructions are followed well (like cleaning your mobile camera lens before shooting) then nothing can stop you from making some of the best images possible. I have attached two photos of flower and foliage and I can bet, you cannot get this sharpness and clarity from a normal mobile camera lens. I had mounted this on my iPhone XR and my word! What result already! I am yet to test these lenses extensively for instance the wide angle lens but I am confident that it‚Äôs result will be satisfying. Even in the macro images, the sharpness and the depth-of-field is really good! Strongly recommend those who wish to make wonderful mobile pics!

Oh! I missed mentioning the boxing of the product! You have to see it to believe it! It comes in a nice casing with slots and a loop to hang it in your trouser loop for instance. The lens look of professional quality and their covers are equally premium. Out and out a premium product in a great price!

I may update my review later on seeing the results of the wide angle lens too.; If u want to explore the wide domain in mobile photography, this lens is an effective device to upgrade to ur mobile. It serves the purpose what its meant for. Added with the macro lens combo is useful item in ur bucket. Following is my detailed review pls read whole. Also, do check the photos for best understanding to make ur purchase decision. Ignore the lens impression at corners in wide photos it happens due to misfit.

Installation :
Very easy. Clip on. Macro lens is default mounted. The wide lens sits on macro. As the lens center should match your mobile lens center, In mobiles with lens in middle, it fits best. For mobile with lens at top edge, ull have trouble sometimes to adjust as the clip wont fit properly. not all mobile at least I have some issues most of time while adjusting so it takes little starting time to make the propor fit. my mobile is Honor play lens at top edge. For mobile with lens at center of little down, its perfect

WIDE LENS :
PROS - Serves the purpose. it really gives 45% extra wide both horizontally and vertically. Wide stretchy impression happens at corners which is property of wide angle. gives satisfactory output. works best in non-direct sunlight, interiors, close focus shots, compact frames also good for landscape
CONS - Cant handle broad daylight too well as chromatic aberrations and dark edges are found at corners. it don't happen at non-direct daylight. see the photos ull get it. sometimes lens round impressions appear, thats the issue with proper fitting in edge lens mobiles

MACRO LENS :
PROS - Classy. satisfactory output. but u must have some knowledge on how to take macro shots, if u know the rules, bingo this lens gives good output. Very nice bokeh and yeah it happens to gives the wide essence even at macro. see photos.
CONS - U need patience. For the best focus u have to get as close as 1 cm, max 2 cm of the target object, otherwise no focus

Overall, i am satisfied with the lens. recommend everybody to buy as with this price range, combo of this lens is really impressive considering the output are commendable; It doesn‚Äôt fit on my phone and Amazon isn‚Äôt initiating a return pick up. Waste of money and time!; Will share the best way i have found personally to use this, considering i have a videographer that uses this lens with their iphone 12 pro max. Positioning it exactly around the camera is very important to ensure the edges of the screen are not blocked/blurred. The best quality and only way that we have found that works is using the 1x zoom/standard zoom.

In terms of quality it is great, feels good and all.

If you are using a gimbal, please note, that if you do not calibrate, or the gimbal is too unbalanced, the gimbal can shake a bit to compensate for the weight when moving fast, so keep that in mind.; The lens cap seems like used.. The package was disorted but lens is good.; SIGNI Pro 2 in 1 Mobile Camera Lens Kit

"Sigma 150-600 Mm F/5-6.3 Dg Os HSM Contemporary Lens for Canon Cameras (745101, Black)","96,690",https://www.amazon.in/Sigma-150-600-5-6-3-Contemporary-Cameras/dp/B00THOYRN6/ref=sr_1_7?crid=OOBID4Q0FLU9&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.8WJih_KCQ0LDPP5NVd3siSHQxrsBcZZ6sY7lRDJQ9zQ1LdH3uCuwIifH6kc41PDTPfBZTB34q-ohAcZ4OhqxCi50-3IKV05ZxQbue7I-Io6BTiv9-AbWSHq8aB-jCeuJUrSaCgcNQ3QU1iYOfOGJopMwYfDxjl7enH6fVYNSFxdH5A3HpUi1IShvGMmEfYNoYfZnZgnsuu4MqE4dN7G4iN_5YPn6JYyMGhxHsnVDFRw.UOs2g9iiqanYcvSGlXGJqIhlr1FAUrniYZJLQa0EdXY&dib_tag=se&keywords=camera+lenses&qid=1719210772&sprefix=camera+lenses%2Caps%2C249&sr=8-7,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613i4RRRoqL._SY879_.jpg,First hyper-telephoto zoom from the contemporary line; Lightweight and compact in construction for higher usability; Water and oil repellent coating on front glass element makes maintenance of the lens surface easier; Dust proof and splash proof mount; Filter size: 95mm,"First of all. Kudos to Sigma for going all out in making this a winner product. The entire combination of pieces which you get with this is show that Sigma wanted no stone unturned in creating this as an excellent value. It comes with a good quality bag and hood. So you don't need to buy the necessities.
Then coming to the product. I had used this lens in Tadoba in December. I had rented it out (which by the way was also a very good experience). I liked to performance, the built quality, the versatility, and the picture quality. One knows that this is image quality loss in telephoto lens compared to prime lens. But honestly, the did't mind the quality at all, in fact it really liked it. If it has any lesser quality than a prime of say 600 mm, then at least I didn't notice. My friends were carrying a 600 mm lens.
On the contrary, it made me realise that even if there was a quality difference between a 600 Prime and this one, I would still trade for the sheer versatility of this lens. In Wildlife, there is a big range of distance you need to cover. For e.g., one Tiger passed by our Gypsy and walked to the water hole where he sat far on the other side. This lens was able to cover all those distances. A Prime can't. And don't forget that in India wildlife safaris are a very bumpy ride. At that time, the size and the flexibility of this lens add great value. It makes it more practical.
All in all, a must have for wildelife photography, unless you are a Professional. Then you should take a Pro's advice, not mine.
Oh, and I must mention. Thanks a lot Amazon. I ordered it, it got delivered, I filed for replacement and no fuss replacement came with return item picked up. All in less than 36 hours. Amazing Customer Service!!! 5 Stars.; If you're looking to get into wildlife or astrophotography and move on from your kit lens, then this is for you. I use this lens primarily for wildlife, and the output images almost always have a WOW factor, and can turn out super dramatic.

Pros:
+ Most affordable 600mm out there
+ Superbly built with water and oil repellant coating. The lens feels rugged.
+ Sharp image quality
+ Superfast autofocus
+ Availability of zoom lock, manual focus override
+ Excellent Optical Stabilization and the option to switch it off or switch levels
+ Option to use Sigma dock to update firmware and customize a lot of lens settings
+ Crazy zoom levels if you manage to get your hands on the 1.4 extender
+ This may be subjective but the bokeh from this lens looks much better than the canon 400mm

Not so major cons:
- There is a very slight distortion towards the edges, especially at 600mm. This is barely noticeable though.
- The lens cap does really sit tight. Slight shake and it falls off.
- You're going to need really good illumination for 600mm at F6.3. It slightly falls off at high zoom levels.
- Obviously not as sharp as Canon lenses, and you can make out the softness when zooming in on a PC. More than good for casual/hobby use though.

Major cons:
- This lens is going to make your hand hurt, make no mistake. It's heavy and built like a tank. As a result, handheld shots at 600mm are not that easy.
- Add to that a zoom ring that is super tight. You have to put in a lot of effort to change zoom levels on this.
- Literally the worst packaging for such an expensive object. No outer cover or cushioning inside to prevent damage. What's worse is that the two seals on top of the package are there only for namesake. The package contents can easily be tampered with. With the box contents easily visible to everybody, it is also prone to theft during transport.

With these cons, I would still rate this as one of the best zoom lenses purely because of its price point and quality, and would recommend this to anybody looking to buy it.; Excellent product from Sigma and equally excellent delivery and shipping by Cloudtail and Amazon. Had used the 150-500mm for 7 years before upgrading to this one. Works flawlessly with the Canon 550D, 700D and 80D - should have no problem with any contemporary Canon Body. Pretty ok at F6.3 and 600mm and of course when the light is good, then it can give lenses 5 times as expensive as this a run for their money. Image quality and sharpness of the 150-600mm is surely improved from the older 150-500mm version - in most lighting scenarios you can see a noticeable difference. Optical stabilization is fast, effective and completely silent and can enable one to take photos down to 1/250s at 600mm on a crop body. Autofocus speed is good - but at 600mm F6.3 it is not the fastest out there, which is understandable. Autofocus speed can be improved if one does not rely on the Full range of the selector switch, but helping the autofocus system by selecting the likely distance to subject using the distance selector switch on the lens. Clicking small, restless birds inside foliage in low light may be a tad more difficult with this lens at 600mm than with the old one at 500mm, but that is part of the challenge of going to higher focal length as well. Autofocus accuracy is excellent and, in decent lighting conditions, is pretty much unbeatable. If combined with a slightly more capable body than a Canon 700D, one can expect pretty impressive results even at ISOs of 1600, while reaching up to 600mm with F6.3. Overall an excellent product for its price. Attached photos, apart from that of the tiger walking down, are all at 600mm on a 700D body with ISO speeds capped at 1600.; Nice product; I bought this for my Nikon D850. Love the combo. Autofocus is fast and precise. Motor is quiet. Optics are sharp and pleasing to my eyes. Colours are rich. A little heavy but that's to be expected for beast like this.; Invested in this lens in advance of a safari to Africa, and so happy I did. The image quality is fantastic! Easy to use. Image stabilization works very well. I did use it with a monopod to help with the weight and stabilization, especially at full zoom, and it worked like a charm. It is quite heavy at about 5 lbs and I had to carry it separately for that reason, but so worth it. Great quality, even in low light. Works very well with my Nikon D7100 camera.; Tengo una Canon EOS 250D y me gusta mucho hacer fotos de aves y naturaleza, llevo un tiempo usando un objetivo Canon 70-300 con buenos resultados pero se me quedaba corto en muchas ocasiones, as√≠ que me decid√≠ por comprar el Sigma 150-600. Ten√≠a miedo porque es un objetivo muy oscuro pero cuando lo he probado me ha maravillado con su calidad de imagen.
A tener en cuenta:
- Es un objetivo grande y pesado, para estar quieto en un sitio, enfocar y disparar. Colgar la c√°mara del cuello con este objetivo para ir andando con √©l no es para nada viable. Para eso tienes el 70-300.
- Se te va a hacer durillo enfocar y hacer zoom sin un tr√≠pode, aunque se puede hacer. Recomendable usar tr√≠pode si vas a estar un buen rato haciendo fotos.
- La nitidez de las im√°genes es una maravilla, lo he probado con aves peque√±as pero me falta irme a un puesto de observaci√≥n de aves. A√∫n as√≠ el resultado es muy bueno.
- En la caja viene una bolsa para transportarlo, correas para la bolsa y el objetivo, el parasol y el objetivo; Il est lourd mais fait le boulot je vous conseil le monopode ou tr√©pied.; Pour l'instant je suis satisfait de cet objectif. Mont√© sur un Nikon D500. Le pare-soleil est encombrant, je m'en passe parfois. Niveau design, ce n'est pas le plus beau, mais √† ce prix ce n'est pas la priorit√©. Bon rapport/qualit√© prix."

No es el m√°s r√°pido para AF, y obvio tiene algunas aberraciones crom√°ticas por la calidad del cristal, pero por el precio esta muy bueno. Para foto en luz d√≠a y exteriores est√° s√∫per, lo mismo en video. No lo he probado aun en bajas luces o de noche.; Gefertigt ist das Geh√§use komplett aus Kunststoff mit einem Bajonett aus Metall, insgesamt macht es aber einen wertigen Eindruck. Hinzu kommt, dass es mit 186 g sehr leicht ist. Das einzige Bedienelement ist der gummierte Fokusring.

Die Bildsch√§rfe ist insgesamt sehr gut und die Offenblende f1.8 ergibt bei Bedarf ein weiches Bokeh und erlaubt auch in Situationen mit weniger Beleuchtung gute Bilder.

Der Autofokus funktioniert in Kombination mit meiner Alpha 6400 sehr gut, in dunkler Umgebung gibt es leichte Abstriche, jedoch haben da teilweise auch teurere Objektive Probleme. Auch ist dieser nicht der schnellste im Vergleich zu anderen, teureren Linsen, ich finde ihn aber auch nicht langsam.

Und ja, er macht Ger√§usche beim Fokusieren, was mich aber nicht st√∂rt, da ich vorwiegend Fotos mache.

Allerdings passt die Linse weniger an meine Nex 7, der Fokus funktioniert nur im AF-S-Modus, im AF-C-Modus versagt er v√∂llig. Ich empfehle vorher auf der Sony Homepage auf die Kompatibilit√§tsliste zu schauen, bevor Du einen Kauf in Erw√§gung ziehst. Da ist das Objektiv z.B. f√ºr die gesamte NEX-Reihe nur eingeschr√§nkt nutzbar, die Details, womit es jeweils hakt, sind ausf√ºhrlich beschrieben. √úbrigens gibt es auch bei der Alpha 6000 massive Einschr√§nkungen, was hier ein K√§ufer bem√§ngelt. Witzigerweise ist auch die Alpha 6400 als eingeschr√§nkt kompatibel beschrieben, erkl√§rt wird das damit, dass die Bildstabilisierung nicht funktioniert. ü§£

Ich habe das Vollformat-Objektiv im Angebot f√ºr 149,- ‚Ç¨ erstanden, das ergibt f√ºr mich ein sehr gutes Preis/Leistungsverh√§ltnis. (Wobei der aktuell genannte UVP von 329,- ‚Ç¨ absoluter Nonsens ist!) Von mir gibt es eine klare Empfehlung.; Mont√© sur un Sony A7 II, cet objectif FE (plein Format) peu cher permet de faire d'excellente photo avec un bokeh de qualit√© √†1.8, donc tr√©s lumineux.

Une vraie affaire dans la gamme Sony !; Premetto che parlo da novizio e che uso la mia macchina fotografica solo per uso amatoriale. Questo obiettivo l‚Äôho acquistato in sostituzione del classico obiettivo kit compreso nelle Sony APS-C (la mia √® una a6100).

Avendone sentito parlare molto tra gli amici appassionati di fotografia, ho voluto acquistarlo anche io.
L‚Äôobiettivo, dal punto di vista della costruzione, √® realizzato interamente in plastica; tuttavia, una volta in mano risulta solido, ben costruito e soprattutto leggero.
La lunghezza focale √® di 50 mm fissa, quindi non c‚Äô√® la possibilit√† di zoomare, per√≤ avendo un‚Äôapertura massima di f1.8 consente di ottenere uno sfondo sfocato piacevole, ideale per ritratti. Anche quando si scatta con un diaframma pi√π chiuso la resa fotografica √® dettagliata e nitida.
Dal mio punto di vista questa lente √® estremamente versatile: √® adatta ad una ampia variet√† di applicazioni tra cui ritratti, paesaggi e street photography.

In conclusione, il Sony 50mm f/1.8 √® un obiettivo eccezionale che offre un'ottima qualit√† ottica e versatilit√†. √à una scelta ideale per chiunque cerchi un obiettivo prime di qualit√†, compatto e ad un prezzo accessibile, perfetto per una vasta gamma di situazioni fotografiche."

Overall the product is good. The three main lenses are good, not that bad, but the three small lenses are probably useless.
1. Fisheye lens - The 198¬∞ fisheye is awesome. The images are good and the videos also come out awesome. (There are two photos of Fisheye affixed, both are taken from the same distance.)
2. Wide-angle lens - There are two wide-angle lens, 0.36x and 0.63x. The 0.63x is good, not that bad, but there are distortions in the side. The 0.36x is totally useless since it makes the images round and it will make more sense to call it Fisheye lens only. The distortions in 0.36x is a lot. (Both the images for wide angles are taken from dance distance)
3. Macro lens - The macro lens are amazing. There are two macros, both 15x. But one acts as a telephoto and zooms on the object. (Both the macro photos are from the same distance)
4. Other lenses - there are four other lenses, Kaleidoscope lens, CPL camera lens, star filter lens and a telephoto lens. The kaleidoscope lens is good, not bad. The CPL is supposed to make the image look better, but I can't find any difference in the picture. The star filter lens is used for adding light glare in the images and is helpful in taking nightscapes. The telephoto is a 2x telephoto and is useless, because most phones come with digital telephoto. And the 2x is not 2x either, it's somewhere between 1.6 - 1.8x.
There was a box which was of good quality and the cloth to clean the lenses was also provided. You can go for it only if you need 15x Macro, 198¬∞ fisheye and some other lenses.; The over all quality of the product is amazing,
The clarity of the photographs clicked is also amazing üëçüèªüëçüèª; All lens are not useful at all; Fisheye lens is good all other lens is average.

Edit (3-11-2016)
I bought it almost a year ago and I had not even imagined that how much I will use this lens. This lens has literally made all other lenses I have almost useless. I use it almost 80% of the times.; Very good; The best available in its category.; Best lens in budget for potrait; Good for protraits and low light; Great portrait lens and useful for a general carry all.; Este lente es genial para retrato, el bokeh que genera es muy bueno. Las im√°genes n√≠tidas y de buena calidad. Adem√°s que por ser 1.8 es bastante luminoso.; Lente Nikon muito boa. Brilho, nitidez.. Vale a compra...; Dem har varit sn√§ll; What a find! This is one of Nikon's best lenses and yet it is one of its cheapest--a remarkable bargain. In particular, it is an exceptionally sharp lens. It just might become the sharpest that you own. You have to try out this lens to appreciate just how excellent it is. And as you know, the better and larger your camera sensor‚Äôs size and resolution, the better performance you will get with the right lens & camera coupling. That is what DxOMark‚Äôs benchmark tests are based upon, pairings, and you can see on that site that this lens is very highly ranked. Basically it matches the performance ranking of this Nikkor 85 1.8G's heavier big brother that is $1,100 more expensive and equally highly regarded 85 mm f1.4 . In my tests, although I love that lens too, I did not find what I needed in its performance wide open so why pay more? Some of my colleagues counter that it has better glass and a heavier build that is well worth the difference. It is a heftier lens, solidly built but just not the best choice available for my travel kit or budget. In a blind test I doubt I could distinguish which print came from which of these two Nikkor 85mm lenses.

On the other end of the price scale, if you are on a tight budget you can still find deals on older 85D auto focus lenses like these ones presently starting around $300 on Amazon, . There is also a faster, well respected, more expensive model, the 85D 1.4 that still has many loyal fans, . All of these Nikkor 85 mm lenses offer very good to excellent optical quality. In general, from what I have seen over the years I think most newer lenses have more contrast and better color saturation because of improved internal coatings but the optical quality of the older glass is still superb. The ""D"" models have advantages of distance scales for DoF and infinity hard stops. As a Nikon user you have a lot of 85mm lenses from which to choose. And if you do not need auto focus Nikon's even older lenses might interest you and come at a great price. As a general rule, the problem with manual focus today is that digital cameras do not usually offer view screens that are close to being the most appropriate for manual focus and that is compounded by modern lenses' barrels, except for Zeiss, that no longer make it easy to control critical focus by offering more distance to gradually move the barrel as needed. Yes, I can and do manual focus but it is not remotely as easy as it was to control focus as in the film camera days when cameras used specialized screens and lenses were designed exclusively for manual focus. Otherwise my recommendations would be a bit different.

Do I have a list of Cons? Just two. The Nikkor 85G does not have image stabilization. Frankly, that would not be reasonably expected at this price, currently about $476. I have rarely, if ever, had image blur using this lens in the studio or outdoors. In part, that is also explained by using it most of the time between f4 and f5.6 at fast shutter speeds so motion is a less likely factor and the auto focus is dependable. Nonetheless, if you have any problems keeping your camera steady without a tripod, then the lack of VR would not be your best choice. Read on below for an 85 mm lens from Tamron that is also very sharp and it has image stabilization. One problem often reported for this Nikkor that I do see is CA on edges where there is quite high contrast. Thankfully, LR and other programs quickly and easily remove it. An lastly, although not really a con, this lens is not intended to be used for things like landscape photography. It performs best at or near wide open depending upon how much DoF you require. That doesn't mean you can't use it. It is still a good lens stopped down but there are simply better lens choices for things like landscape. You can still go ahead and use it in a pinch.

Third party alternatives? There are lots. I would be remiss if I did not mention some of the highly regarded 85 mm lenses that other manufacturers offer including my favorites if budget no longer matters. Zeiss offers several, terrific 85 mm lenses both old and new. But for most folks their higher price and lack of auto focus could be deal breakers. Tamron offers a new, highly rated alternative with auto focus for $749 that is distinguished by being the first 85 mm lens with image stabilization (VC),. I have not used it but but there are sufficient reviews that agree it is exceptionally sharp, that the VC is effective, but there are also some reports of consistent focus issues. In general, if the user is not at fault, there are two common kinds of trouble. Any manufacturer's lenses can suffer from focus shift but thankfully, unless the lens is damaged, that can be fine tuned in-camera to correct by the user. The other kind is more complicated and it only affects third party lenses' in their auto focus compatibility. It is a quite a different focussing issue. All third party lenses can have such problems with Nikon because it does not share its proprietary, secret handshake between camera and lens to ensure the highest level and consistency of auto focus compatibility. Companies have no recourse except to reverse engineer. But care must be taken in doing so to avoid patent infringement. In fact, Nikon successfully sued Sigma for a lot of money on that account c. 2011.

Sigma makes my highest recommendation for an 85 mm lens, the recently released, 85 1.4 lens from its renowned Art series, which at this time sells for $1,200. What distinguishes Sigma from competitors so far is that it came up with a good, cheap solution that can correct focus shift and any compatibility problems (so far) with Nikon cameras, using its affordable $59 dock, . The dock does not work with every Sigma lens but it covers all of the Art series plus some others. I have had excellent results with these lenses. IMO, their 50 1.4 Art lens is the best lens I have ever used in terms of sharpness and resolution although there have been Leica and Zeiss lenses that are also stellar. This Art series is an especially great match for my Nikon D800e. At this moment, the Sigma 85 1.4 Art is the highest rated lens overall at DxOMark. And just like the Sigma 50 1.4 Art, this newly released Sigma 85 1.4 Art lens rivals the performance of the esteemed Zeiss Otus lenses at their respected focal lengths. The Zeiss Otus 85 mm 1.4 lens, is outstanding, manual only, and at $4,400, is by far the most expensive 85mm lens you can buy that fits a Nikon. Zeiss offers other excellent performing 85 mm lenses for less with a Nikon F mount but they all are manual focus only and are still relatively expensive such as the Milvus 85 1.4, . Older, very good Zeiss 85 mm lenses will be less. I admit that I am a fan of Zeiss. Its lenses have always demonstrated a distinctive look with remarkably attractive color rendering and contrast. Just don't expect to see Zeiss lenses with auto focus for Nikon.

Before you buy an 85 mm focal length lens which I will assume is for portraiture, what are the best alternatives? This is a subjective matter. First of all nothing I can recommend is going to be as fine a performer or nearly as inexpensive as this Nikkor 85G AND also be as small and light weight. And of course, if you do primarily want it for portraits, 85 mm has been a favorite focal length for generations. But don‚Äôt feel constrained by convention. For example, some people prefer 50mm for portraits. However, if your subject has any feature that is larger than average you might find a 50mm lens exacerbates that. The counter argument would be that knowledgable posing technique and post production can minimize such problems. You will also being working closer to your subject for better or for worse. But if you do prefer a ""normal"" lens and you especially love bokeh, the Nikkor 58 mm is exceptional for portraits. Sometimes it gets a bad rap but I think it is easily misunderstood because of its intended purpose. It is a kind of speciality lens because of the impressive way it makes distinctive transitions moving between what is sharpest to areas that are out of focus. The bokeh is remarkable, as good or better as anything I have seen. But again, that is a subjective matter. I just do not consider it to be an all purpose normal lens although I know people who disagree although with a few caveats.

Overall though, for portraiture, I recommend looking within the focal range of 85, 105, and to a lesser extent, 135 mm primes or else weigh the trade offs in using a relatively light weight zoom like the excellent Nikkor 70-200mm f/4 lens which costs about $1,400. I offer that range because there is never a single answer for all of us about what best suits our personal needs so keep your options open to begin with. If you like to work in low light obviously you will appreciate the fastest lens models at any focal length. But they will tend to be considerably larger, heavier and more expensive. No flying submarine exists although I come back to our little Nikkor 85G 1.8 lens that IMO just might come closest to offering a compelling case for being the best compromise. And you can't beat its quality for the price. Nonetheless, there are several alternatives I have mentioned here that deserve your consideration.

If feasible, nothing beats a side by side comparison of lenses using tests that are appropriate in covering everything it is you like to do and that you do the most frequently. See how it feels in yours, the balance with your camera as well as its optics. Those are the keys. Cameras come and go but it is solid planning to buy the best lenses you can when you can. It is very old but wise advice. I wish you great success in your hunt."

Pour le prix, on peut dire qu'il s'en tire vraiment bien. Je suis entierement satisfait du produit, il est l√©ger, pas trop encombrant, et la qualit√© est vraiment satisfaisante pour cette gamme de prix. Je ne regrette absolument pas mon achat. C'est du Canon et √ßa se ressent m√™me si √ßa reste l'entr√©ede gamme.
Je recommande pour les personnes souhaitant un t√©l√©objectif √† petit budget, tr√®s bon rapport qualit√© prix.; Ich war vor dem Kauf sehr skeptisch und ging davon aus, dass Objektiv wieder zur√ºckschicken zu m√ºssen, da es f√ºr meine Anforderungen nicht ausreichen w√ºrde.
Was soll ich sagen, ich bin beeindruckt, dass nicht immer nur teure Objektive gute Qualit√§t liefern.

Wichtig waren f√ºr mich folgende Kriterien:
- Geeignet f√ºr Vollformat (verwende es an der 6D)
- Leicht und Kompakt

Ich hatte mir zuerst in der etwas h√∂heren Preis-Klasse das 70-200 2.8 II angeschaut. Das Objektiv ist wirklich der Hammer, aber es war f√ºr meine Zwecke einfach zu schwer und zu gro√ü. Da ich ein Tele gerne mal auf Wanderungen dabei habe, ist f√ºr mich die Gr√∂√üe wichtiger als die Lichtst√§rke.

Doch nun ein kurzer Blick zum 75-300 III

Verarbeitung
F√ºr den Preis in Ordnung, nat√ºrlich nicht mit L-Objektiven vergleichbar, aber man kann nunmal nicht √Ñpfel mit Birnen vergleichen. Der Zoom geht leicht und f√§hrt auch nicht durch das Eigengewicht rein oder raus, dass erlebt man ja bei Tamron immer wieder gerne. Pluspunkt auch f√ºr ein Metall-Bajonet. Minuspunkt hingegen f√ºr die rotierende Frontlinse beim Fokus, wer Polfilter ben√∂tigt, der wird es hier etwas schwer haben, mich hingegen st√∂rt es nicht, da ich keinen Filter daran nutze.

Bildqualit√§t
Nun kommt der kritische Punkt, der mir sehr wichtig ist. Ich war positiv √ºberrascht, wie gut die Abbildungsleistung des Objektivs ist. Man merkt, dass ab ca. 200mm das Objektiv von der Sch√§rfe abnimmt, bei 300mm ist es etwas weich. Man sollte dann auf ca. 8 oder h√∂her abblenden, um genug Sch√§rfe zu bekommen.
Ich nutze das Objektiv nach M√∂glichkeit nur bis 200mm, und da ist die Qualit√§t wirklich sehr gut. Selbst die Randbereiche sind noch relativ scharf.
Einzig st√∂ren tut mich die CA (Farbs√§ume an R√§ndern), gerade bei hohen Kontrasten sieht man sie manchmal etwas, man kann sie zwar rausrechnen, doch etwas nehmen sie von der Qualit√§t des Bildes. Aber wie gesagt, bis 200mm ist auch das gut kontrolliert.

Autofokus
Der Autofokus ist ein Punkt, der nicht perfekt ist. Der Fokus ist relativ langsam, immerhin ist er an der 6D dennoch recht Treffsicher. Kann aber auch sein, dass ich da von meinen USM-Objektiven einfach sehr verw√∂hnt bin ;)

Fazit
F√ºr APS-C Kameras w√ºrde ich das 55-250mm empfehlen, das habe ich fr√ºher genutzt und war sehr zufrieden.
Wer ein g√ºnstiges, kompaktes Tele haupts√§chlich f√ºr Outdoor-Fotografie am Vollformat sucht, sollte bedenkenlos zugreifen. F√ºr den Preis bekommt man eine Menge geboten, und im Vergleich zu vielen Spiegel-Tele, die des √∂fteren f√ºr einen √§hnlichen Preis in Umlauf sind, und eine schreckliche Bildqualit√§t liefern, bekommt man einen vern√ºnftigen Autofokus, eine Sprungblende und vorallendingen eine variable Brennweite, so dass man auch mal rauszoomen kann.; I bought this lens about eight months ago for my Canon 350D. If like me you bought the kit that comes bundled with the 18-55mm lens you'll notice there is a big gap when it comes to zoom/telephoto shots, this is a great budget tele-photo zoom lens that does what it says on the tin, and fills the gap nicely.

I am an amateur photographer at best and still learning, but after using the lens for a while I was disappointed to learn that the f stop values really do make a big difference - the widest aperture you will be able to set this lens to is 4.0 at 75mm and only 5.6 at 300mm, if your really serious you need a fast lens like f/2.8, and definitely with IS (image stabilisation) - the lens is not that heavy (for me), but during a long shoot it starts to feel like a cannon (pardon the pun), the lens really protrudes out at towards the 300mm end, and if you hold the camera pointing straight down, expect lens creep. Add an external flash onto the hot shoe and expect a real workout!

My wife complains its way too heavy - especially with a speedlite mounted on top, just carry a tripod if you expect to be on a long shoot, or mount the external flash on a tripod (you'll need something like a speedlite wireless remote for this, expensive, but its tiny and weighs next to nothing and gets the speedlite off the camera).

Having said all that, I have got some really great shots with this, and overall for the price you pay for this lens it's a real good value for money. If I'm going to a function, like a party within a hall, I would almost always use this lens (not to good for mid range shots - 50mm better for this, which is why I carry another camera to save swapping lenses about), great for candid photography where you can position yourself at the other side of the hall and take shots without distracting or letting your subjects know they are being shot - just have a strong arm, and good light conditions/flash. For portrait shots, and shots where you slow the shutter speed use a tripod, or you get too much blur/softness. If you also intend to pan the shot, a tripod with a panning handle is also essential.

The other thing you need to bear in mind is the multiplication factor (of the focal length) of your camera. Unless your lucky enough to have a camera with the same focal length as a 35mm film camera, i.e. a full 35mm frame size, the camera may effectively crop the image to fit on the film sensor - the 350D has a factor of x1.6, this means this lens is effectively a 120mm - 480mm lens (!) This is great on the tele-photo side, you get more magnification than you pay for, but not so good for wide angle or down at the 75mm end, where you've actually got 120mm. (Because of this factor, if you want a wide-angle lens and you have a 350/400D then you'd be better off going for ultra wide 14mm).

Bottom line, it's a heavy lens, and no IS, but for the price of the lens very good value for money! I haven't regretted buying this, and unless you're a really serious photographer, and shoot within the limits of this lens you wont either.; En tant que photographe d√©butante, j‚Äôai acheter cette objectif pour une meilleure qualit√© et des photos plus magnifiques, et je ne suis pas d√©√ßue! L‚Äôobjectif est assez peu l√©ger, mais √ßa reste correct"

I have to state they for the price, this is one of the best I have ever seen which will take your mobile photography to a completely different level. If instructions are followed well (like cleaning your mobile camera lens before shooting) then nothing can stop you from making some of the best images possible. I have attached two photos of flower and foliage and I can bet, you cannot get this sharpness and clarity from a normal mobile camera lens. I had mounted this on my iPhone XR and my word! What result already! I am yet to test these lenses extensively for instance the wide angle lens but I am confident that it‚Äôs result will be satisfying. Even in the macro images, the sharpness and the depth-of-field is really good! Strongly recommend those who wish to make wonderful mobile pics!

Oh! I missed mentioning the boxing of the product! You have to see it to believe it! It comes in a nice casing with slots and a loop to hang it in your trouser loop for instance. The lens look of professional quality and their covers are equally premium. Out and out a premium product in a great price!

I may update my review later on seeing the results of the wide angle lens too.; If u want to explore the wide domain in mobile photography, this lens is an effective device to upgrade to ur mobile. It serves the purpose what its meant for. Added with the macro lens combo is useful item in ur bucket. Following is my detailed review pls read whole. Also, do check the photos for best understanding to make ur purchase decision. Ignore the lens impression at corners in wide photos it happens due to misfit.

Installation :
Very easy. Clip on. Macro lens is default mounted. The wide lens sits on macro. As the lens center should match your mobile lens center, In mobiles with lens in middle, it fits best. For mobile with lens at top edge, ull have trouble sometimes to adjust as the clip wont fit properly. not all mobile at least I have some issues most of time while adjusting so it takes little starting time to make the propor fit. my mobile is Honor play lens at top edge. For mobile with lens at center of little down, its perfect

WIDE LENS :
PROS - Serves the purpose. it really gives 45% extra wide both horizontally and vertically. Wide stretchy impression happens at corners which is property of wide angle. gives satisfactory output. works best in non-direct sunlight, interiors, close focus shots, compact frames also good for landscape
CONS - Cant handle broad daylight too well as chromatic aberrations and dark edges are found at corners. it don't happen at non-direct daylight. see the photos ull get it. sometimes lens round impressions appear, thats the issue with proper fitting in edge lens mobiles

MACRO LENS :
PROS - Classy. satisfactory output. but u must have some knowledge on how to take macro shots, if u know the rules, bingo this lens gives good output. Very nice bokeh and yeah it happens to gives the wide essence even at macro. see photos.
CONS - U need patience. For the best focus u have to get as close as 1 cm, max 2 cm of the target object, otherwise no focus

Overall, i am satisfied with the lens. recommend everybody to buy as with this price range, combo of this lens is really impressive considering the output are commendable; It doesn‚Äôt fit on my phone and Amazon isn‚Äôt initiating a return pick up. Waste of money and time!; Will share the best way i have found personally to use this, considering i have a videographer that uses this lens with their iphone 12 pro max. Positioning it exactly around the camera is very important to ensure the edges of the screen are not blocked/blurred. The best quality and only way that we have found that works is using the 1x zoom/standard zoom.

In terms of quality it is great, feels good and all.

If you are using a gimbal, please note, that if you do not calibrate, or the gimbal is too unbalanced, the gimbal can shake a bit to compensate for the weight when moving fast, so keep that in mind.; The lens cap seems like used.. The package was disorted but lens is good.; SIGNI Pro 2 in 1 Mobile Camera Lens Kit

I have to state they for the price, this is one of the best I have ever seen which will take your mobile photography to a completely different level. If instructions are followed well (like cleaning your mobile camera lens before shooting) then nothing can stop you from making some of the best images possible. I have attached two photos of flower and foliage and I can bet, you cannot get this sharpness and clarity from a normal mobile camera lens. I had mounted this on my iPhone XR and my word! What result already! I am yet to test these lenses extensively for instance the wide angle lens but I am confident that it‚Äôs result will be satisfying. Even in the macro images, the sharpness and the depth-of-field is really good! Strongly recommend those who wish to make wonderful mobile pics!

Oh! I missed mentioning the boxing of the product! You have to see it to believe it! It comes in a nice casing with slots and a loop to hang it in your trouser loop for instance. The lens look of professional quality and their covers are equally premium. Out and out a premium product in a great price!

I may update my review later on seeing the results of the wide angle lens too.; If u want to explore the wide domain in mobile photography, this lens is an effective device to upgrade to ur mobile. It serves the purpose what its meant for. Added with the macro lens combo is useful item in ur bucket. Following is my detailed review pls read whole. Also, do check the photos for best understanding to make ur purchase decision. Ignore the lens impression at corners in wide photos it happens due to misfit.

Installation :
Very easy. Clip on. Macro lens is default mounted. The wide lens sits on macro. As the lens center should match your mobile lens center, In mobiles with lens in middle, it fits best. For mobile with lens at top edge, ull have trouble sometimes to adjust as the clip wont fit properly. not all mobile at least I have some issues most of time while adjusting so it takes little starting time to make the propor fit. my mobile is Honor play lens at top edge. For mobile with lens at center of little down, its perfect

WIDE LENS :
PROS - Serves the purpose. it really gives 45% extra wide both horizontally and vertically. Wide stretchy impression happens at corners which is property of wide angle. gives satisfactory output. works best in non-direct sunlight, interiors, close focus shots, compact frames also good for landscape
CONS - Cant handle broad daylight too well as chromatic aberrations and dark edges are found at corners. it don't happen at non-direct daylight. see the photos ull get it. sometimes lens round impressions appear, thats the issue with proper fitting in edge lens mobiles

MACRO LENS :
PROS - Classy. satisfactory output. but u must have some knowledge on how to take macro shots, if u know the rules, bingo this lens gives good output. Very nice bokeh and yeah it happens to gives the wide essence even at macro. see photos.
CONS - U need patience. For the best focus u have to get as close as 1 cm, max 2 cm of the target object, otherwise no focus

Overall, i am satisfied with the lens. recommend everybody to buy as with this price range, combo of this lens is really impressive considering the output are commendable; It doesn‚Äôt fit on my phone and Amazon isn‚Äôt initiating a return pick up. Waste of money and time!; Will share the best way i have found personally to use this, considering i have a videographer that uses this lens with their iphone 12 pro max. Positioning it exactly around the camera is very important to ensure the edges of the screen are not blocked/blurred. The best quality and only way that we have found that works is using the 1x zoom/standard zoom.

In terms of quality it is great, feels good and all.

If you are using a gimbal, please note, that if you do not calibrate, or the gimbal is too unbalanced, the gimbal can shake a bit to compensate for the weight when moving fast, so keep that in mind.; The lens cap seems like used.. The package was disorted but lens is good.; SIGNI Pro 2 in 1 Mobile Camera Lens Kit

The specs can be had from the internet.

FINISH & BUILD:
All plastic, but very well finished. The zoom ring is much superior to Nikon's other lens in this price range- smooth, well damped and clear notches at either ends. While the lens has a plastic mount, it should last years if one uses it with respect.

AF SPEED:
I'll compare the AF speed of this lens with 3 others: the 55-200 VR, the 70-300VR (AF-S) and the USD/USM from Tamron and Canon.
Compared to the 55-200/55-300, there is no competition. This AF-P blows them out of the water.
Compared to the 70-300 AF-S, the practical difference is marginal. While the AF-P is much faster (3-4x) than the AF-S if you rack from minimum to infinity, the AF-S is almost as fast in the real world where focusing involves the lens moving in smaller distances. So if you have a 70-300 AF-S, stick to it. The AF-P seems faster as it does not jerk like the AF-S does when focusing.
Compared to Canon's USM and Tamron's USD, the speed is about the same. The AF-P seems slightly slower than the Canon STMs.
Low light AF is poor, compared to Tamron's f/6.3 lens. Strange that Nikon could not ensure better compatibility. My Tamron 150-600 works better on the D5200 at f/6.3, than the AF-P works with the D7200.

FOCUS RESET ISSUE:
Most of you would have read that the AF-P works on some Nikon DSLRs (like the D5200) but the focus resets after the meter goes to sleep. In reality, the focus does NOT reset when the meter goes to sleep. When you re-acquire focus after the meter goes to sleep, the lens first goes to infinity and then reacquires focus. This takes about 0.5 sec and robs the lens of the advantages of its otherwise excellent AF speed. You can reduce the impact by extending the standby timers to 30m in custom settings.

VR and Weight:
VR seems good. It seems to work well in panning as well. So the inability to switch off VR in some Nikon models is not a minus. However, the light weight of this lens makes it a mismatch in the heavier DSLRs (like D7200, etc.) as the AF point shifts ever so slightly doe to the shutter vibrations, a problem that heavier lens like the 70-300 AF-S do not have (their extra weight help in stabilizing the shooting action). I would recommend this lens strictly with the lighter Nikon bodies.

SHARPNESS & COLOR:
Compared to the 70-300 AF-S, the AF-P has superior sharpness at 300mm (at f/6.3) whereas the gap narrows when the AF-S is taken to f/8. Till 250mm, the AF-S holds its own.
Color seems to be better on the AF-S. Depth in color shades is much better on the AF-S. The AF-P glass seems to be of the cheaper versions as used in the older 55-200. If micro-contrast is important, choose the AF-S.

SUMMARY:
If you have a lighter Nikon (D3300+, D5200+), this lens is a no-brainer. Its cheap, light, and transforms the cameras. You may have to cope sometimes with focus lags or freezes (esp in low light), but the pros outweigh the cons.
If you have a mid-range Nikon (D7200+), the AF-S is the better option. Its AF is almost as fast as the AF-P, is as sharp till 250mm, doesn't freeze and the weight helps in stabilizing.; This is a good tele lens. It focus very fast and silently. This picture of rhino, was taken from about 200 meter away, and this is a camera jpeg output with minimum cropping and no adjustment. It lacks focus and vr button, but since it is not a fast lens, it should be used in good lighting condition only. So, there is no need of turning off the vr so often, and the manual focus override is instant. It's not weather sealed and build with plastic only, but it keeps weigh down. It's a perfect lens for casual photographer looking for a tele lens. Only catch is that it won't work with any body which is older than the d7200. So check compatibility before purchase.; Pros: 1. Completely silent focussing
2. Amazing clarity at the farthest end of
the zoom
3. Good build quality

Cons: 1. Low light photography is a challenge; Superb pic quality. Auto focus also working in D5300.; ; First of all it looks old and used lens. Grip was greyish like fungus. and dust inside the lens!!! That's why i am returning it. Attaching some photos in which you can see black shadow bubbles at same location in every picture .; I have a mixed feeling buying this lens. I ordered it from kasper which is a prime seller of amazon but when I received it I found it is sold buy some other seller named digital world which was not even in the seller list of this lens .This kind of thing is strongly not appreciated.Now about the package-the box was a nikon box by look, this was sealed from the frontside with a two years warranty seal but rear side was tampered and it is found some one opened the box from rear side and manually sealed it .If you buy any lens from nikon dealers you never find it like this.Also
the filter size of this lens is wrongly printed on this box it is printed 52mm whitch should be 58mm.It is somehow unrealistic that brand like nikon will do such silly mistake.So the genuinity of the product off course is questionable.Any how nikon india 2 years warranty card was in the box.The lens it self looks brand new with new rubber smell. It was found scratchless on body and lens front element.Fitted smoothly to D5200 body and detected without any error message.Photograph information in nikon view nxII software shows that it is nikon AF-P 70-300mm ed lens and the VR is on.lens sharpness is very good.Auto focus is fast enough but not as fast that it can track a series of crane flying in the sky or a moving butterfly. Autofocus operation is near about soundness.Manual focus override works.Lens flare is almost nil. If it is original ,good future output can be expected.; One of the best telephoto zoom lens out there for beginners. Best in-class silent, quick and accurate auto focus, even when zoomed all the way to 300mm. Picture quality is excellent.

Timely delivery of lens. Packaging is good except that its not in original packaging and does not include guide book. But you will get warranty card.

One star deducted as the product is not as described i.e., has a white-plastic rear lens cap instead of black screw type and non-original packaging.

Overall, its a must buy lens for beginners and alike.; I purchased this to replace the identical lens that came with my camera kit years back - identical in all respects except that this lens has vibration reduction. It‚Äôs allowed me to use the full range of the lens without a tripod. The professionals can argue the minutiae of its pros/cons. It‚Äôs not a $2000 lens, and I don‚Äôt have it on a high-dollar camera. I get great pics nonetheless.; Muy buen lente, es mi segundo lente y la verdad es una maravilla, si estas empezando en la fotograf√≠a te lo recomiendo. Funciona a la perfecci√≥n.; Adquiri o produto para uso com a Nikon D-3400, j√° ciente da compatibilidade.
F√°cil de usar, considerando que sou fot√≥grafo amador recreativo, mas que permite obter imagens de qualidade diferenciada com alguma paci√™ncia e estudo de princ√≠pios b√°sicos da fotografia.
A redu√ß√£o de vibra√ß√£o funciona muito bem, permitindo imagens n√≠tidas mesmo quando captadas por pessoas sem pr√°tica.; Me ha gustado todo, lo principal el producto que se ajustaba a mis expectativas totalmente, la rapidez con que me ha llegado y que la empresa que lo proporciona a Amazon se pusiera en contacto conmigo para verificar si era lo que yo necesitaba y era compatible con mi c√°mara fotogr√°fica.; Ich benutze das Objektiv an einer D7200.
Es wird in der Kombination von Nikon als teilkompatibel gelistet, ich gehe davon aus, dass man wohl den Autofokus im Men√º nicht ausschalten kann (einen Schalter hat das Objektiv nicht).
Habe ich nie getestet...
Aber, ehrlich gesagt, wer benutzt so ein Objektiv mit manuellem Fokus...?
Jemand, der bei einer solchen Brennweite manuell fokussieren m√∂chte, wird vermutlich zu einer h√∂herwertigen Variante wie einem 70-200 f/2.8 greifen.

Dementsprechend bin ich mit der Leistung f√ºr das Geld top zufrieden, nachdem mein bisheriges 70-300 f/4-5.6 eines Drittherstellers Probleme mit dem Bildstabilisator bekommen hat.
Die Bildqualit√§t ist fast gleich gut, am langen Ende in der Mitte sogar noch einen Tick sch√§rfer, ich habe die Korrekturdaten automatisch in der Kamera (Firmwareupdate der Kamera vorausgesetzt!) und der Autofokus ist mit Abstand der schnellste, leiseste und treffsicherste aller meiner Autofokus-Linsen, sowohl von Nikon, als auch von Sigma und Tamron (alle allerdings schon etwas √§lter).

Da ich sonst am liebsten mit manuellen Festbrennweiten arbeite, und nur f√ºr die kleinen Schnappsch√ºsse zwischendurch eine erschwingliche Tele-Erweiterung zu meinem 17-50 f/2.8 gesucht habe, ist das Nikkor f√ºr meine Zwecke perfekt."

This small lens gives you excellent image quality and a sturdy built quality for such a budget price. I didn't find anything to complain about. This fast normal lens alone is sufficient for general purpose photography and can give you service for more than a lifetime. It doesn't have VR but, with the max aparture of f/1.8, I never felt the need.
Points to be noted before buying:
1. It gives 50mm focal length only on full frame digital bodies and film SLR s. On Dx bodies the effective focal length will be 75mm.
2. Autofocus will not work on Dx bodies that doesn't have motor built in the body like D 3000 & 5000 series. One can, however, use it on those as a manual focus lens.; The Nikon 50mm f1.8 comes in two variants: 50mm f1.8D and 50mm f1.8G. This one is the ""D"" version which does not have an Autofocus feature. It works in all Nikon DSLRs, but the autofocus would work only in cameras with internal autofocus motor, that is, the D90 series, D7000 series and above. It is not meant for full frame cameras as well. Let me get into a detailed review.

The lens is very well designed and feels pretty sturdy. It is well build with a strong plastic body and a metal mount. There is a manual aperture controller as well, with means it works with the older SLR cameras from Nikon. For current DSLRs, it is required to lock in at the maximum aperture. This feature also comes in handy if you are a budget photographer, to take macro images with the use of a lens reversal ring. I personally felt that the focus ring is a bit tighter than on the Canon version of this lens, as I couldn't shoot smooth focus transitions in video. But for stills, it is an astounding lens with brilliant bokeh, sharpness and colour reproduction. The focus has to be carefully adjusted, by looking at the green dot that appears in the lower left of the viewfinder to obtain tack sharp focus.The minimum focusing point is 0.45m, which is decent for a 50mm prime, but a bit less for me, personally. Readily go for it if you're okay with focusing shots manually. However, I wouldn't recommend this lens to a beginner because you would need something more simpler to practise on and improve your photographic skills. For video shooting, go for it if you are confident enough about turning the focus ring smoothly. And believe me, the focus ring goes a long way from 0.45m to infinity! For video shooters, I also recommend a stabilizer because the footage is very shaky at 50mm. Considering overall, this is a wonderful lens, if chosen for the right purpose. It has been serving my needs since a year, and is still safe and sound!; If you wish to learn photography with an inexpensive lens, then this is definitely the lens to go for. I use it in my D5300 which DOES NOT has a auto focus motor built in the camera body, so I have to manually focus it every time. The D7000 series and full frame models will have no issue using it in auto focus. Manual focusing through the live view mode is easy, it is the focusing through the view finder that needs practice. I'm still practicing by shooting through viewfinder.

I've been using it for a week and the image results are sharp with smooth bokeh. The overall build quality of the lens seems solid but it is too early to tell. The lens mount is metal which again indicates towards a good build. The lens does not come with a lens pouch. The filter size for this lens is 52mm.

I've heard that this lens can also be used as a macro lens by using a lens reversal ring. I've to purchase the said ring before i can comment on it. I will edit the comment with further updates. The photos attached are jpeg straight from the camera.

Overall verdict: Excellent lens at this price. Whatever be your camera model just go for it.; I'm using the lens with my D5200. It's an entry level body therefore doens't have inbuilt autofocus motor hence I'm not able to use the autofocus function on the lens. But with manual focus, if done correctly it captures some really great sharp photos.

Go for it if you're on low budget. It'd have been better if there were STM, but still no complaints.

As a beginner one may face some issues while focusing and keeping the subject in proper focus, but once you learn, you can capture some awesome shots.; Dislike: Manual focus is not perfect sometimes.
Low light focusing is not good and slow .
Very soft with open f/ ( as f/1.8).No details with that apature.
Not sweet able to beginners modal as 3000D/3100D/3200D because manual focus is slow and sometimes not needle sharpe focus impossible.
Many professional like to manual focus.

Like : Value for money.
Good build quality.
Apacher ring have so you can make it macro photography with lens reverse ring.
Steel mount, I like it.
I suggest go for G type lens.

Like; I just wanna say.. The lense works great even after 1 yr using .... Same quality of photoes..even your video experience will be grt using this lense... And yes it doesn't have autofocus ..but if you have autofocus in you camera then bro just go fr it....it really works grt... Worth it...; I wanted to buy a fast prime lens for a friend who is a beginner to introduce him to fast prime lenses. He has a d5000 and this lens pairs nicely with the body. You can use the M mode, but since Aperture can be controlled from the body, so you can use A mode too, which is a big plus. For those who want to get started with a very fast (1.8) prime, this lens is a very economical option. On the d5000, the aperture ring needs to be locked at the lowest setting (f22), and then the aperture can be controlled directly from the body. Focus needs to done manually but the focus indicator dot in the viewfinder of the d5000 helps a lot. Anyway its not much of an issue considering you are getting a f1.8 prime lens for around 7k.; Lente maravilhosa. E chegou muito r√°pido.; The lens is very clear and seems to be made of really good materials. The lens produces very clear images that I love to take often. Your able to get a really clear view of the target of the images. I would definitely recommend this lens to any person looking for a cheap but durable and clear lens.; OK„Åß„Åô; Este es el t√≠pico producto BBB - bueno, bonito y barato. Un nifty-fifty en toda regla. Pocas pegas le puedo poner, sobre todo teniendo en cuenta su precio.

Calidad de imagen m√°s que aceptable. Suficientemente n√≠tido incluso a f1.8. En una DX se te quedar√° en unos 75 mm - ideal para retratos. En una FX grandota ni te enteras que lo tienes montado.
He sacado bonitos retratos de la family con √©l, sobre todo en ByN.

Pegas? Pocas palas de diafragma - las fuentes de luz en el fondo no salen redondeadas. El enfoque no es interno - gira por fuera al enfocar.
Peccata minuta, para lo que es y lo que vale.

Ideal para iniciarse en el mundo de los fijos. Todo el mundo deber√≠a tener un nifty-fifty como este.; Este lente es la mejor compra que he hecho en mucho tiempo, el costo es rid√≠culo comparado con la calidad que de imagen que otorga. Al ser de focal fija y apertura de f/1.8 es un lente MUY luminoso por lo que funcionar√° excelente en interiores y a la luz del sol tendr√°s que obturar a velocidades de hasta 1/2000 para obtener una foto bien expuesta. Dicho esto, es un excelente lente para retratos ya que la focal de 50 mm otorga seg√∫n expertos, la foto m√°s similar posible a la vista humana.

Al tener apertura de f/1.8 el efecto ""Bookeh"" que este lente logra es impresionante, eso s√≠, hay que tener mucho cuidado a la hora de tomar las fotos, pues si somos inexpertos o tenemos poca experiencia es probable que la apertura de 1.8 haga que tus fotos lleguen a salir un poco desenfocadas, ya que la profundidad de campo se vuelve m√≠nima y el √°rea de enfoque muy peque√±a. Recomiendo usarlo a 2.8 y solo usar 1.8 cuando ya cuenten con experiencia o un tr√≠pode.

Un dato muy importante a mencionar es que este lente cuenta con Auto enfoque, pero este solo funcionar√° con c√°maras que tengan motor de enfoque integrado (Nikon d7200 para arriba si no me equivoco) por lo que si posees una c√°mara de menor gama como la series 5000 o las 3000 no podr√°s hacer auto-enfoque con este lente y tendr√°s que hacerlo manual. Si el autoenfoque es imprescindible para ti te recomiendo buscar el modelo que dice ""AF-S"", pues ese modelo cuenta con un motor de enfoque integrado que funciona con c√°maras de gama baja como las series 3000 y 5000.

La apertura del diafragma se puede controlar de manera mec√°nica moviendo el anillo de selecci√≥n, o si prefieres hacerlo desde la c√°mara puedes poner la apertura focal en f/22 y activar el seguro del lente, de este podr√°s controlar la apertura desde la c√°mara.

La montura es de metal por lo que el lente te durar√° por a√±os y si como yo, tienes una c√°mara sin motor de enfoque integrado (Nikon D3300 en mi caso), recuerda, NO PODR√ÅS HACER ENFOQUE AUTOM√ÅTICO."

Sharp image at all focal lengths when used with controlled environment. Best at F6. Won't regret after buying.; Does what is says. Lightweight.; Good , value for money ,; First of all to clear the confusion, it is compatible with both Full frame and APSC Cameras for Sony. This model matches with the one on Tamron‚Äôs official site.
I was looking for a budget telephoto lens and decided to buy Sony 55-210mm lens in budget then i came across some videos on youtube for this lens and bought this immediately, This is the best telephoto lens for the price, I was shocked with some of the pics I took on day one, I am attaching two samples here , fyi the moon pic is a cropped one and i have started photography as a hobby just a month ago.; Sharpness: 8
Zoom: 9 (no issue with corner sharpness)
Handling: 8 (good for birding)
Value for money: 10; Who said this is for beginners? It's you who is taking the photograph. Not the equipment... But this is a good associate for the gear to draw exemplary results... good choice foe professionals I believe by these first shots...; ; ; Habe mir dieses Objektiv 70-300 und das 70-180 angeschaut. Sind beides gute Objektiv aber v√∂llig unterschiedlich. Das 70-180 ist schwer, hat sehr wenig Tele, ist lichtstark durch Offenblende 2.8, gut im Dunkeln aber im Hellen bringt es wegen der fehlenden Tiefensch√§rfe weniger. Und teuer. F√ºr Hochzeiten sicher sehr gut, f√ºr Urlaub und Reisen zu eingeschr√§nkt und schwer.
Das 70-300 dagegen habe ich f√ºr unter 400 Euro im Angebot gekauft, es ist sehr leicht, erlaubt mit 300 mm sogar V√∂gel und Flugzeuge zu fotografieren und hat einen zuverl√§ssigen Autofokus (Sony A7C2). Mit der Bildqualit√§t bin ich sehr zufrieden, sobald man eine Blende abblendet. Im Nahbereich bei 70 mm am Rande hat es Schw√§chen aber da habe ich mein 2070.
Eine absolute Kaufempfehlung als Erg√§nzung im Objektivpark um draussen Objekte ""herzuholen"" an die man sonst nicht herankommt. F√ºr mich durch das geringe Gewicht, den Superpreis ein Objektiv welches ich h√§ufig mit in der Tasche habe. In den Bildern sind zum Teile deutliche Crops wie der Vogel.; Acquistato in sostituzione del classico obiettivo del kit, il SEL 55-210 f4.5-6.3 oss. Il miglioramento √® notevole. Sono rimasto subito colpito dalla nitidezza generale delle immagini, stessi colori degli obiettivi Sony, e ottimo contrasto. Nel mio caso, usandolo su una Sony A6300- c'√® da fare un po' di attenzione per la mancanza della stabilizzazione,ma, si puo' ovviare all'inconveniente, alzando un po' gli asa, che non √® certo un problema , con le fotocamere moderne. (Beh, la stabilizzazione esiste da pochi anni, ma le foto le facevamo anche prima, e con ben altre limitazioni....basta pensare alla pellicola, che normalmente si usava la 100asa, e non si poteva certo aumentare o diminuire a piacimento, e inoltre le attrezzature pesavano il triplo!!) . Ritornando all'obiettivo in questione, sono molto soddisfatto dell'acquisto, mantiene tutte le funzioni sia AF, che tutto il resto, come se fosse un Sony originale. Questo, insieme alla buona qualita, e al peso veramente leggero, ( a proposito, i 545 grammi dichiarati si riferiscono al solo obiettivo, senza tappi e paraluce, completo di tutto si va oltre i 650 grammi!).Credo ci sia ben poco da aggiungere, le recensioni, che si trovano sui vari siti, ne parlano solo bene, e, addirittura, pare vada anche meglio del Sony 70-300,(che pero', io non ho mai avuto il piacere di provare, perch√® troppo costoso per me!!).Io lo uso solo poche volte l'anno, quando nelle zone paludose, vicino casa mia, si fermano volatili migratori, di tutti i tipi, ma poi, per il resto, e per i viaggi, ho l'ottimo sel 18-135 oss, che sta montato in macchina praticamente fisso.; Je l'utilise avec mon a7ii
Objectif compacte et l√©ger un objectif que j'aurai du prendre bien avant en compl√©ment de mon 50mm et 28mm
Il n'est pas parfait mais en m√™me temps a un tel prix on ne peut rivaliser avec la gamme GM de Sony ^^ ce n'est ni le m√™me prix ni la m√™me taille ni le m√™me poids
Mais pour un usage de photographe passionn√© mais avec un budget r√©duit, il promet tout de m√™me de superbes clich√©s surtout qu'il n'est pas trop encombrant ni trop lourd il pourra donc m'accompagner facilement partout
L'autofocus est plut√¥t performant sauf en basse lumi√®re (mais comme beaucou d'autre)
Par contre celui ci est tr√®s silencieux et rapide
Les bagues coulisses bien, la course de la bague de mise au point peut √™tre un peu trop grande mais cela permet d'√™tre pr√©cis en mise au point manuelle, la qualit√© globale a l'air bonne.
Bref un objectif polyvalent √† avoir dans son sac photo qui permettra de s'initier √† la photo sportive ou animali√®re mais √©galement √† d'autre usage. Un rapport qualit√© prix excellent.; I was initially dithering over whether to buy this or the 28-200mm, I have the Tamron 17-38 and 28-70 lenses which are both excellent, but thought I‚Äôd try this for the price for a longer reach. I have the Sony 24-240 too but it‚Äôs a heavy beast and thought a combination of lenses may work out well. When it arrived, out of habit, I registered it with Tamron straight away , not thinking I might want to return it and after the first day or so that‚Äôs what I was thinking of doing‚Ä¶but then‚Ä¶I used it a lot more and was glad I kept it. It‚Äôs a really light lens, no IS but not been an issue so far and I‚Äôm really impressed with the photos I get from it. I‚Äôm an amateur snapper for the last 45 years so as long as the end result looks good to me, or can look a bit better still with a touch of Photoshop, then I‚Äôm happy enough, and this lens delivers great results as far as I‚Äôm concerned!; Buena calidad de imagen.
El dial del zoom deber√≠a dar m√°s control sobre el movimiento. Con rozarlo gira.
Y como pongo en el t√≠tulo, pesa bastante como para no contar con su propio soporte para anclar al tr√≠pode o monopie"

Es buena opci√≥n por el precio-calidad.; Mit der Anschaffung der Nikon Coolpix P1000 habe ich mir einen lang ersehnten Traum erf√ºllt. Da das Objektiv dieser Kamera nicht austauschbar ist, war mir der Schutz der Linse besonders wichtig. Gleichzeitig wollte ich keine Kompromisse bei der Qualit√§t meiner Naturfotografien eingehen. Der UV-Sperrfilter von AmazonBasics hat sich als die ideale L√∂sung herausgestellt.

Seit ich den Filter benutze, sind meine Outdoor-Fotos deutlich klarer. Der Effekt, den das UV-Licht auf meine Bilder hatte ‚Äì jene bl√§uliche Verf√§rbung, die manchmal den Eindruck von Frische tr√ºbte ‚Äì geh√∂rt der Vergangenheit an. Meine Bilder wirken nun lebendiger und die Farben treten viel nat√ºrlicher hervor. Dies ist gerade bei Landschafts- und Tierfotografie, wo die Details und die Farbechtheit z√§hlen, von unsch√§tzbarem Wert.

Doch der Filter leistet mehr als nur die Verbesserung der Bildqualit√§t: Er sch√ºtzt das wertvolle Objektiv meiner Kamera zuverl√§ssig vor Kratzern, Staub und St√∂√üen ‚Äì Risiken, die bei Outdoor-Aktivit√§ten immer gegeben sind. Dieser permanente Schutz gibt mir die Freiheit, mich auf das einzulassen, was ich am meisten liebe ‚Äì das Einfangen der Sch√∂nheit der Natur ‚Äì ohne mir Sorgen um mein Equipment machen zu m√ºssen.

Die Verarbeitungsqualit√§t des Filters ist hervorragend. Er l√§sst sich leicht anbringen und sitzt fest und sicher auf dem Objektiv. Auch das Preis-Leistungs-Verh√§ltnis ist √ºberzeugend. Ich habe selten ein Produkt gefunden, das so eine hohe Qualit√§t zu einem solch fairen Preis bietet.

Ich kann diesen UV-Sperrfilter von AmazonBasics uneingeschr√§nkt weiterempfehlen. Er ist ein kleines, aber wesentliches Zubeh√∂rteil, das einen gro√üen Unterschied in der Fotografie macht. Meine Erfahrung war durchweg positiv und ich w√ºrde diesen Filter definitiv immer wieder kaufen.

Super sharp & only two other lenses you need are one super wide angle & a tele photo lense.; I'm thrilled with my purchase of the Tamron 17-70mm f/2.8 VC lens! Here's why I love it:

Versatile zoom range: Perfect for everyday shooting ‚Äì landscapes, portraits, street photography, and more.

Bright f/2.8 aperture: Lets lots of light in, great for low-light shots and creating blurry backgrounds (bokeh).

Sharp images: The pictures are clear with great detail.
Good image stabilization (VC): Helps reduce camera shake for blur-free shots.

Weather sealing: I feel confident taking this out in light rain or dust.

Compact and lightweight: Easy to travel with and comfortable to carry for long periods.

Great value for the price: You get a lot of performance for what you pay.

A Few Minor Things:
Some distortion at the edges: It's not super noticeable with most shots, and you can fix it in editing software.

Focusing can be slightly noisy: It's not a deal-breaker, but it's something to note.

Overall:
If you're looking for a fantastic all-around lens, the Tamron 17-70mm f/2.8 VC is a brilliant choice. I highly recommend it!; Excellent lens at affordable price. Image quality excellent even in low light conditions. Got Sony 18-135mm kit lens along with Sony a6600 and this lens is no near in its quality with tamron 17-70 F/2.8 lens. Built quality, auto focus and its own built in stabiliser works excellent.; Auto focus is bang on and the bokeh is as good as a prime lense. Undoubtedly the best lense available for sony E mount as on date!; I'm using sony a6400 with 18-105 F4 lens but actually F4 is problem crop frame and F4 we can't use in low-light situation not only for that f2.8 we can get good background blur.; The lens I received produce vignetting rings when shoot at wider aperture like F2.8, F3.2, F3.5.
These rings are visible both in JPEG and RAW files, it is even visible in the view finder if we closely look.

I recently purchased this lens for my Sony FX30, and I am extremely impressed with its performance. The image quality is sharp and clear, even in low-light conditions. The autofocus is quick and accurate, making it perfect for both photography and videography. The build quality feels robust and durable, yet it remains lightweight enough for easy handling. Overall, this lens has significantly enhanced my shooting experience, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their gears.; Por relaci√≥n, calidad precio puedo decir que es el mejor lente para camaras aps-c; I'll be honest, I was skeptical spending almost as much on a lens as I did on my camera body; but I must say I'm thoroughly impressed with this lens. The ranges that it covers is perfect for general wide to general zoom.

Pros:
- Very solid build. The zoom mechanics feel smooth and articulating. The focus ring is smooth to turn. I haven't done extensive manual focus tests, but in my quick attempts, it feels consistent and learnable.
- Auto focus is strong, consistent and predictable. I haven't noticed any major focus breathing as long as you're in properly lit scenes. (Sony a6100)
- Focal range is solid for every-day, non-niche work.
- Minimum focus distance is impressive. You can get macro-inspired shots with this lens. Of course it won't be AS good as a true macro, but it will allow you to explore a similar vibe and see if that style of photography inspires you. It'd be a solid test before spending a bunch of a macro specific lens.
- Stabilized lens allows for lower shutter speed photos. The stabilization helps for video, but I'd still recommend using a stabilizer as there still will be mico-jitters. ** This is WITHOUT IBIS.
- f2.8 is quite fast for a zoom lens. It's decent is low-ish light, and creates a fairly decent background separation and bokeh. Of course it won't be as solid as a prime lens; but for an every day walk around lens, it's quite impressive!
- Very crisp photos, not a lot of chromatic aberration or distortion. It feels consistent regardless of focal length.
- Very random, but the lens cap for this lens is very solid. It speaks to the overall quality of the build.

cons / neutrals:
- Fairly large and heavy for an APS-C lens. For me this isn't a negative, but I figured I'd mention it if you're used to very small lenses and are doing a lot of gimbal / glide-cam work. It does get a bit heavy when it's fully rigged out. Personally I enjoy the weight of it as it helps with hand-held shots. If you're used to full-frame glass, this will be a breeze.; Stupefacente, tropicalizzato, luminoso, rapporto prezzo/qualit√†: eccellente, resa cromatica ottima. Qualche difetto trascurabile e rimediabile in pp. Cosa aggiungere: peccato non ci sia l'equivalente per FF. La risposta √® chiara, sarebbe molto pi√π grande, pesante ed ad un prezzo ben pi√π alto.

Very sharp images.
Autofocus is decent
No vignetting at higher f stops
Powerful low light performance

Cons:
A little bit lag in autofocus when shooting videos. (Better to go with Manual focus for serious movie making)
Little bit of lens abberration, but not noticeable; Just the best lens I could ever have. I compared this with the Sony FE Lenses and the quality in all images just looks amazing.

Avec sa conception optique avanc√©e comprenant 11 √©l√©ments en 8 groupes, dont trois √©l√©ments en verre √† dispersion partielle et un √©l√©ment asph√©rique, il offre des images nettes et contrast√©es, avec des couleurs vives et pr√©cises qui ajoutent une touche de r√©alisme et d'authenticit√© √† chaque photo.

Trust me it's the best lens in this budget.
Thanks; This lens is awesome. The most notable thing about this lens is it is small and solidly made with high quality materials . The provided rubber ring outside the lens is a bliss to use for focusing.Not much heavy and one can easily carry in a small camera carry bag. Though it has 1.4 aperture which means it is perfect for low light condition,but, not to get confuse that it can't be zoomed in or out because of its fixed focal length i.e. 30 mm,and it is ideal for portrait and real estate photography. So if you are a landscape photographer or wanting a lens for vlogging,this lens might not be a good choice for you because of its limition on wide angle side. Instead, you can choose the 16mm sigma over this.
Overall,the bokeh effect from this lens is mind-blowing that will make you instantly fall in love.
So, if budget is your prior concern,grab this or otherwise grab the 16 mm one. But both lens are perfect in their position.
Cheers!; One of the best and one of the fewer lenses to provide optimum image quality, low light performance, smoother defocused backgrounds or bokeh or background blur whatsoever you may refer to! Build quality is a bit questionable yet rugged enough for most purposes!
Pros:
1.Worth the money
2.Good optical quality
3.Perfectly packaged
4.Focus ring has a really good grip
5.Decent low light capability
6.Most versatile focal length
7.Sharp wide open and stopping down to smaller aperture gives the best possible results
8.Walk around lens and can be used both for portraits and landscapes
9. The focal length converts to 45mm in Full frame equivalents and hence becomes a really great option on APSC body
Cons:
1.Snappy autofocus can be an issue if you heavily rely on autofocus! Anyways works really well if u have a sony a6500 or a6300
2.Aperture blades when wide open produce slightly elliptical bokeh balls, but stopping down a bit about f/2 and further fixes the issue!
3.Not so sharp wide open. Again stopping down ipmroves everything!
4.A very slight purple fringing against harsh lights! Can be seen only when you pixel peep enough! Again not a major issue
5.Quite larger; Simply blown away by the performance of this lens .... I recently purchased this lens for my sony a6300 and i have to say this is the sharpest lens you can buy for sony APSC cameras.The pictures are sharp . The autofocus is good.Everything looks amazing.. The autofocus performance while shooting video is amazing .
PROS :
Amazing sharpness
Very good autofocus in video mode
Built quality which is superb
The bokeh or depth of field simple amazing
CONS :
Not very good autofoucs while taking pictures it sometimes hunts for the subject on which it should focus
Not stablised so the videos are shaky if it is handheld
That jelly effect can be noticed in 4K videos.
Since new sigma 16mm f1.4 lens is now available in you can also consider that too but if you are interested in portraits or some close up shots this is the lens for you .
For more info you can find me on insta or fb via username _ishan.singh.rathore_
UPDATED : It recently got an update v.3 (March 2018) and now its manual focusing is far more better than before.; This lens is quite sharp at f1.4 which is amazing. Its small and light. Probably the best lens for street photography considering the aize and weight when coupled with small sony APS-C cameras.

Awesome image quality and contrast. The con I would say is chromatic Aberration which is there a little at f1.4.; Bokeh,Low light shots, Indoor shots, Portrait with this lens have great performance with Sony 6700.; A lil but of purple fringing is there, but can be corrected using lightroom or photoshop. This lens is best for potraits. Personally I use it with an APSC sensor camera. So, 30mm magnifies to 45mm (approx) its a sweet spot for low light photos, potraits, street photography & much more. For Videos also it is best for the price it comes. I use Sony Alpya a6400 with this lens. The results are attached give them a look, also check out my profile on instagram @aryndash. If you are using it for videos I would suggest to go with the Picture Profile 7 & 8 of the Sony Alpha Cameras. After color grading it would give very nice results. Stabilization is not that good. But if you have a gimbal then it would just go best with it. Auto focus is also excellent.

Overall for the price of 27000 it is a good investment. I got it for 27k with a cashback of 1250 to my pay balance. I don't know if the cashback is still available. But for 27k its good. Go for it without second thought. üì∑; ; Un objetivo del cual jam√°s me arrepentir√©, b√°sico y necesario para fotograf√≠a de retrato, se desempe√±a muy bien en el autoenfoque, destacando su calidad y nitidez. La construcci√≥n se siente premium, construido de aluminio, pero no te confundas, no agrega peso a tu c√°mara, resultando muy c√≥modo para viajar. En el video se desenvuelve muy bien, el bokeh que obtienes es sutil, cremoso. Definitivamente hermoso y muy conveniente en cuanto a precio-calidad.; Neat little lens that produces sharp shots. Has fast autofocus, minimal edge distortion (easily fixed in post) and accurate color rendition.

This 30mm 1.4 lens is a 45mm (f2.1) full-frame equivalent, so it definitely excels in low-light scenes and subject separation for portraits.

Paired with a compact APS-C body, this Sigma lens is also reasonably compact for travel purposes.

One thing I wish it did have was OSS, but for the price, it does everything else exceptionally well.; A lens with exceptional value for money, really love it. Just had a bit of a hiccup - the one I bought from Amazon was the wrong mount; it's not an E-mount. Now using the one I got from Best Buy.; Bonita, constru√ß√£o excelente, autofoco silencioso e r√°pido.; Great lens. I love the pictures it allows me to take."

Loved it.; After a lot of research, I finalized on this lens for my E mount camera. But it was either unavailable or too expensive most of the time. Recently It became available at a reasonable price and immediately I ordered it. I was a bit worried reading other reviews that they received the FE lens without OSS when they ordered this one. To my relief, I got the correct product in a sealed box (Thanks to seller CPSTORE).

This lens is really sharp and OSS is a pleasant addition compared to the Nikon 50mm 1.8G lens that I used to have in my previous camera. Focus is very smooth and silent. Low light performance is stellar. Thanks to the OSS, I could take sharp images at shutter speeds as low as 1/10.

The only complaint I have about the lens is the price - it is certainly overpriced. I ended up paying Rs. 23,990. THB Rs.15k would be reasonable (perhaps it's just me).; One of the best lens for blur background photo and video ...
Thank you so much Sony
All photos is directly click the Sony zv E-10 camera and 50mm OSS lens; Compatible with my sony a7iii. Easy to install and use. Sharp images.; La lente SEL5014B nativa de Sony tiene autoenfoque y estabilizador, ocupa y pesa poco, visualmente queda estupenda. Buena calidad de imagen, muy luminosa con un diafragma m√°ximo de 1.8. En una c√°mara APSC esos 50mm equivalen a unos 80mm en Full Frame, as√≠ que est√° m√°s bien orientada a retratos o escenas m√°s comprimidas.; it's an awesome lens for the price.
but check it carefully. mine had a small thing like a lint inside the lens under the front glass. there is no way it can be cleaned.
such a shame.; L'obiettivo a focale fissa Sony SEL-50F18B 50mm F1.8 √® un'ottima scelta per i fotografi che cercano un obiettivo versatile e di alta qualit√† per la loro fotocamera Sony.

La lente √® costruita con materiali di alta qualit√† e offre una nitidezza straordinaria, sia al centro che ai bordi dell'immagine. La sua apertura massima di F1.8 permette di catturare immagini con sfocatura dello sfondo e una maggiore profondit√† di campo, ideale per ritratti o scatti in ambienti con scarsa illuminazione.

Inoltre, l'obiettivo √® dotato di un motore silenzioso e veloce per la messa a fuoco automatica, che rende facile e preciso l'uso in molte situazioni. La messa a fuoco manuale √® altrettanto fluida e precisa, per dare ai fotografi il massimo controllo e creativit√† nella loro fotografia.

La costruzione dell'obiettivo √® solida e resistente, e il design elegante si adatta perfettamente alle fotocamere Sony. Il suo peso leggero lo rende facile da trasportare e utilizzare per scatti a mano libera.

In sintesi, l'obiettivo Sony SEL-50F18B 50mm F1.8 √® un'ottima scelta per i fotografi che cercano un obiettivo di alta qualit√†, nitido e versatile, ideale per ritratti e scatti in condizioni di scarsa illuminazione. La sua costruzione robusta e il design elegante lo rendono anche un'aggiunta elegante alla collezione di obiettivi di qualsiasi fotografo Sony.; Les plus :
- compact
- l√©ger
- bonne √† tr√®s bonne qualit√© d'image
- bonne nettet√©
- aberrations chromatiques pr√©sentes mais contr√¥l√©es (sauf cas extr√™me)
- AF efficace et silencieux (il a quand m√™me ces limites dans certaines situations)
- qualit√© g√©n√©ral
- distance minimale de focus assez sympa (juste bonne)
- √©quivalent en plein format d'un 75mm f2.7 (facteur de recadrage de 1.5* apsc)
- la stabilisation bonne √† moyenne
- la focal de portrait pas excellence
- un bon bokeh (flou d'arri√®re plan artistique) en portrait serr√© comme en portrait de pied
- prix raisonnable

Les moins :
- F1.8 (√©quivalent en plein format f2.7) c'est bien mais on aurait √©videmment pr√©f√©r√© un f1.4
- pas grand chose
- distance minimale de focus bof

Un objectif vraiment sympa pour sa qualit√© general (image et construction), sa l√©g√®ret√© et compacit√©, sa stab utile, et son f1.8 bon en basse lumi√®re et tr√®s sympa en bokeh !
Il trouvera facilement sa place dans votre sac, et joue pleinement la carte de sony avec sa volont√© de compact/l√©ger/abordable. Parfait pour se lancer dans le portrait, attention √† la distance de recul, je conseille !

Da das Objektiv dieser Kamera nicht austauschbar ist, war mir der Schutz der Linse besonders wichtig. Gleichzeitig wollte ich keine Kompromisse bei der Qualit√§t meiner Naturfotografien eingehen. Der UV-Sperrfilter von AmazonBasics hat sich als die ideale L√∂sung herausgestellt.

Seit ich den Filter benutze, sind meine Outdoor-Fotos deutlich klarer. Der Effekt, den das UV-Licht auf meine Bilder hatte ‚Äì jene bl√§uliche Verf√§rbung, die manchmal den Eindruck von Frische tr√ºbte ‚Äì geh√∂rt der Vergangenheit an. Meine Bilder wirken nun lebendiger und die Farben treten viel nat√ºrlicher hervor. Dies ist gerade bei Landschafts- und Tierfotografie, wo die Details und die Farbechtheit z√§hlen, von unsch√§tzbarem Wert.

Doch der Filter leistet mehr als nur die Verbesserung der Bildqualit√§t: Er sch√ºtzt das wertvolle Objektiv meiner Kamera zuverl√§ssig vor Kratzern, Staub und St√∂√üen ‚Äì Risiken, die bei Outdoor-Aktivit√§ten immer gegeben sind. Dieser permanente Schutz gibt mir die Freiheit, mich auf das einzulassen, was ich am meisten liebe ‚Äì das Einfangen der Sch√∂nheit der Natur ‚Äì ohne mir Sorgen um mein Equipment machen zu m√ºssen.

Die Verarbeitungsqualit√§t des Filters ist hervorragend. Er l√§sst sich leicht anbringen und sitzt fest und sicher auf dem Objektiv. Auch das Preis-Leistungs-Verh√§ltnis ist √ºberzeugend. Ich habe selten ein Produkt gefunden, das so eine hohe Qualit√§t zu einem solch fairen Preis bietet.

Ich kann diesen UV-Sperrfilter von AmazonBasics uneingeschr√§nkt weiterempfehlen. Er ist ein kleines, aber wesentliches Zubeh√∂rteil, das einen gro√üen Unterschied in der Fotografie macht. Meine Erfahrung war durchweg positiv und ich w√ºrde diesen Filter definitiv immer wieder kaufen.

Happy capturing!; Hi adcom this product really worth it, friends everyone can visit my instagraom page @lokesh_graphy do see more regarding this lens capture

Quality is awesome
Zoom is better; After reading the reviews, I have purchased this lens for insect photography but when trying to click a picture, it's useless. Focus length is too low so it's impossible to make a photo of an insect even a dead insect. We need to put the lens into the mouth of insects to focus. I want my money back. I want to return the product with full refund. So that I can buy any other good item which is useful.; Lens comes nicely packed.The carry pouch contains the lens ,lens cap and cleaning cloth.It is nice and easy to carry.
12x gives good photos from 3*4cm distance.There is no depth in the image only areas in one plain are focused rest of the subject comes unclear.Also at this close you can photograph only minute subjects.Anything bigger than an ant comes sharp only partially.
24x is super but you can use only for immobile object as it to be taken vey close to it about 1-2cm.The white cap helps to prevent lens from hitting the object.But useless for insects unless it is dead or sleeping.

Aperture is fixed at F4 but it still takes amazing portraits at 50mm or above (as in pics attached), sharpness n clarity is amazing as well. Best step up from a kit lens and you may not need another lens. Best value for money as well; The lens has great reach and features for videographers. The zoom is entirely internal and good for gimbals. The stabilization is also better than the kit lens in you plan to go handheld. Power zoom is also good but a preference thing. All zoom is done using motors.

The photos are not the sharpest and the minimum focusing distance is also not great. It is also on the heavier side.

Good for my intended purpose of shooting videos at indoor, decently lit events.

For photography or lower light performance also look at the Tamron 17-70. It is heavier and probably doesn't have as good stabilization but is better for photos and F2.8.; Received Sony 18-105 F4 ( Version 4.0) in the second week of August 2020. I am completely in love with this lens.
Decision-making:
After picking up a6100 with kit lens I was really confused between buying one of the sigma trio lens ( 16mm, 30mm, 56mm ) OR just go with Sony 18105mm f4. The truth is the f1.4 is not super necessary for everyday purpose. I needed this lens for food photography mainly and some video work. There are many youtube videos which call it a decent lens only and even the dxo mark isn't that good. The youtubers who said that are professionals and must be using really expensive gear going in lakhs and lakhs. Also the videos talk about the version 1.0 which might have had some issues, and the dxo mark was done on sony 6000 which is a very old camera.
Shortcomings:
The only one shortcomings I found personally was the minimum focus distance on the wider side of the zoom. Once you zoom in between 60-90mm. It's just fabulous.
Best Features:
18mm the widest focal length is said to be the best focal length to use this lens at and I have got great photos using all the different focal lengths. And love the weight of the lens. Extremely well built with all metal construction and feels really good on my sony 6100. I do have the sony 16-50mm kit lens which I might just use now for the 16mm f3.5 advantage in some situations ( for low light conditions) and places where the weight might be an issue. Will need a medium to large size gimbal with this lens.
If you've reached till here do click the HELPFUL icon next to this review; If you are a photographer or a videographer consider this lens as an all in one option for your Sony mirrorless camera. The sharpness of the picture is excellent.; Good value for money; Ok; After a deep research I found a good lens which satisfied all my needs.; The lens has great build quality and is a great all rounder for my A6300. The optical stabilisation greatly reduces the inherent rolling shutter of the camera. Being a native lens you get to take advantage of Sony Alpha‚Äôs amazing autofocus. Lens barrel doesn‚Äôt move while zooming, which is a great plus for anyone who might want to use it on a gimbal. Sharpness is pretty good. Overall great bang for your buck; This is an amazing all around lens, remember you cannot have the best of all worlds when it comes to lenses.

It is sharp and impressive for the price! It is a little slow at focusing on full auto compared to other lenses I‚Äôve used. It‚Äôs amazing for video and the smooth zoom is quite the weapon for documentary style footage.

For the price this is a very impressive hybrid lens and I would recommend it for anyone with a cropped sensor Sony!

I used it with a A6700 I was very impressed with the results. All photos are on auto.; Me encanta la forma de accionar el zoom y que no sobresalga el lente pues funciona perfecto con un estabilizador, lo recomiendo mucho por precio y versatilidad; Gostei da lente da Sony era o produto que me faltava para a minha c√¢mera. Fiquei satisfeito üòå com o atendimento da Amazon que cumpriu o prazo determinado. Minha satisfa√ß√£o da primeira compra foi excelente. Grato a Amazon.; Premessa: non sono un fotografo professionista, ho una modesta Sony a6000 e non ho mai provato obiettivi blasonati che costano molto pi√π di questo Sony 18-105mm f/4. Faccio principalmente fotografia naturalistica, specialmente paesaggi e cascate; faccio poche foto notturne o di interni, e pochi video. Questo √® il mio primo obiettivo ‚Äúserio‚Äù dopo l‚Äôobiettivo kit 16-50 e un paio di obiettivi vintage Helios 44m (favolosi).

Premesso questo, passare dall‚Äôobiettivo kit 16-50 a questo zoom √® un salto di qualit√† notevolissimo: le foto acquisiscono un tocco professionale, grazie all‚Äôottima nitidezza e al notevole microcontrasto. Parlando di nitidezza: ho smesso di fare il ‚Äúpixel peeper‚Äù, per cui non vado a guardare com‚Äô√® la resa negli angoli. Ma poich√© nei paesaggi diurni scatto sempre a f/8 ‚Äì f/11, le foto sono sempre molto ben definite; ho visto recensioni che confrontano questo zoom con il Sigma 18-50 e non si notano differenze.

Il range 18-105 per me √® perfetto, sia per i panorami che per le foto di dettaglio. L‚Äôapertura costante a f/4, pensata per il video, √® forse un po‚Äô il limite di questo obiettivo se si vuole fare ritrattistica, ma basta giocare un po‚Äô con lo zoom per ottenere dei buoni sfondi sfumati.

La resa dei colori √® magnifica. Questo, se vogliamo, √® un aspetto meno importante rispetto alla nitidezza, visto che i colori si possono migliorare in post; ma gi√† il JPG come esce dalla macchina foto √® bellissimo, i colori sono pieni e vibranti. Una menzione speciale per la stabilizzazione, che funziona sorprendentemente bene: in alcuni casi sono riuscito a fare foto a mano con 1/5‚Äô‚Äô, e sono venute ferme! Normalmente uso il cavalletto.

Difetti: sicuramente la distorsione e la vignettatura che si osservano alle focali pi√π ampie. Si correggono facilmente in post (uso Darktable), ma spesso non correggo la distorsione che nelle foto naturalistiche non si nota. L‚Äôautofocus potrebbe essere un pochino pi√π veloce. Quando c‚Äô√® poca luce o uso il cavalletto o, in interni, monto il Meike 35mm f/1.4.

Il peso e l‚Äôingombro‚Ä¶ √® meno di mezzo chilo, la lunghezza √® abbastanza contenuta, ma con questo zoom la a6000 cessa di essere una macchina tascabile. Comunque passo le giornate con la macchina al collo e sono ancora vivo.

In conclusione: ho preso l‚Äôobiettivo durante il black friday, ho speso poco meno di 400 euro e lo ricomprerei sicuramente. Raccomando questo zoom senza riserve.; Ich kann mich einfach nicht trennen von diesem Objektiv, zumindest nicht so ganz.

Insgesamt habe ich dieses Objektiv schon 3x gekauft und nun bleibt es auch, zumindest bis Sony daf√ºr vielleicht mal einen Nachfolger bringt.

Sicherlich gibt es Objektive die a) mehr Sch√§rfe abliefern oder b) eine leichtere Bauweise mit sich bringen, aber f√ºr mich liegt der Charme bei diesem Objektiv in der Vielseitigkeit und der dem innenliegenden Zoom. Das Objektiv bleibt immer auf gleicher L√§nge, da der Zoome innenliegend erfolgt.

Beim Filmen hat es den Vorteil das man den Gimbal nur einmal ausrichten muss, egal welche Brennweite man filmt und auf Reisen hat es den Vorteil, dass dieses Objektiv wieder anf√§llig ist, als Objektive die mechanisch und au√üen ein- und ausfahren.

+ Der Autofokus an der A6400 und ZV-E10 ist mit dem Objektiv schnell genug

+ Die Brennweite von 18-105 an APSC ist so wunderbar variabel

+ Man kann im hohen Telebereich sehr gut freistellen und das Bokeh ist ruhig

+ Die Lichtst√§rke mit F4 ist kein Lichtwunder, aber erm√∂glicht mit modernen Kameras inzwischen viel mehr,
als man denkt. Denn das Rauschverhalten der modernen APSC-Kameras, ist einfach enorm gut.

+ Die Bildqualit√§t ist f√ºr mich auch gut. Klar ist eine Festbrennweite sch√§rfer oder besser in der jeweiligen Brennweite, aber den Trade-off von etwas Bildqualit√§t tausche ich gern, wenn ich daf√ºr immer bereit bin und keinen Moment mehr verpasse, weil 18-105 immer sofort startklar ist. Ein Bild haben ist immer besser, als es zu verpassen. Auch hier gibt es so viele M√∂glichkeiten in Post, was Sch√§rfe, Rauschen etc betrifft. Daher bevorzuge ich im Alltag diese Vielseitigkeit mit einer guten Bildqualit√§t

+ Tolles Objektiv um zu filmen. Es ist optisch stabilisiert und ob mit oder ohne Gimbal, das Objektiv macht eine sehr gute und ebenfalls vielseitige Figur dabei.

+ F√ºr den Preis von ca. 400‚Ç¨ +/- ist es immer noch ein tolles G-Serie Objektiv

Die neuen linearen AF Motoren die Sony aus dem FF nun auch f√ºr APSC Objektive √ºbernommen hat, wie z.B. beim 70-350G w√ºrde ich hier auch gern in einer neuen Version von einem 18-105 sehen. Mal sehen was Sony in der Zukunft √ºberlegt, denn dieses Objektiv ist ja schon lang, aber eben auch sehr erfolgreich auf dem Markt und wertstabil."

I bought it at a lower price when it was in short supply. And has been my main lens ever since.

Focal length: The viewing angle with an APS-C camera would be quite wide and this makes the 16mm focal length perfect for indoor use. This lens will also be great for landscape photography, environmental portraits and experimental photography.

Background blur: The fast aperture allows you to really isolate your subject at close distances. Bokeh is smooth and creamy. Helps you get that pseudo full-frame look.

Low light: The performance is outstanding in low light as it has a large max. aperture, plus light transmission through the lens is good. See 4th image.

Resolution: Sharpness at apertures over F2.0 is just mind-numbing.

Macro capabilities: The lens has a short minimum focus distance which allows you to get extremely close to your subject. And since the lens is ridiculously sharp you can always crop the image to achieve a ""macro"" effect. See uploaded images. See 5th and 6th image.

Size and weight: It is large and heavy in comparison to the tiny kit lens of Sony APS-C cameras, and makes an A6XXX body front heavy.

There is no alternative in the Sony APS-C mirrorless system for this lens. Just go for it. If the weight is not an issue, you will be extremely happy with this lens.; Lens if great for landscape and environtmental portraits. Very sharp and at f 1.4 you can get creamy bokeh . Auto focus is also good , I have been using it with my sony a6000 and the lens rarely goes off camera and is my go to lens for landscapes.; Well, I wanted to purchase this lens for my Sony Alpha a5100 since a very long time and finally, when I bought it, there was no end to my happiness. As there are numerous reviews on Youtube and other tech websites where it is always mentioned this is one of the sharpest and clear lenses for Sony mirrorless systems. The same was experienced hands-on. Believe me, the output images are extremely sharp corner to corner and centre to corner. The colour reproduction is also very beautiful. The image quality is leagues ahead of the stock lens. The stock lens is still a better option for shooting videos. Sony's OSS is really helpful there. For capturing images, Sigma 16mm F1.4 is unmatched my any other lens in this as well as even higher price range.

For low light photography, this lens is the real monster. I took it for a spin for some night shots and my mind was blown away by seeing how much light is being captured by this lens even during the night. The aperture of F1.4 is really useful. The images were crisp, full of dynamic ranges without any noticeable noise whatsoever. Another thing to notice is the amount of foreground and background depth of field this lens is capable to produce. The subjects stand out distinctly and that brings another dimension to the image.

Coming to the autofocus capability, the lens focuses very fast, comparable to Sony's own lens. AF-C and DMF work very well too. I did not face any delays or issues while focusing on a subject. Actually, 3 out of around 200 photos were out of focus, and all these 3 photos were of my pet who never stops running around. The lens can also be used as a portrait lens. I have taken a few portraits and they were decent enough with a good background defocussed and good bokeh. Also to mention, the lens produces buttery smooth bokeh. The bokeh is not as large as the ones produced the Sigma 56mm F1.4 lens but still considering this as a wide-angle lens the bokeh is beautiful.

Coming to the construction of the lens, it is a very well built. It feels solid with a pristine fit and finish. The focus ring is buttery smooth and a pleasure to use. The lens is on the heavier side (~450 grams) which is a little bit of a concern if you are using a small camera body like Alpha a5100. For a6000 and higher, it might not be that much of a concern. But the weight can be ignored considering the superior quality of the image that this lens produces.

Overall I am extremely happy with the product. This is my second Sigma lens and they really proved how consistent they are when it comes to the quality of the image produced and the pristine built.

The only disappointment that I had is on how Amazon delivers its product nowadays. They delivered this lens in an ordinary plastic cover without any bubble wrap protections. These lenses are heavy and fragile material and need to be delivered with the utmost care. But as expected by any Indian delivery agent, he dropped the package somewhere and dented one corner of the manufacturer carton box. I am not sure would it cause any damage to the lens itself which had another level of protection inside the carton box. My lens is performing well but still, I am unhappy with the delivery of the product. I am always sceptic if the lens has suffered any unnoticeable internal damage. Amazon should really look into their delivery department now and provide proper training to the delivery partners. Also, I will request Amazon to deliver expensive/fragile items by properly protecting them inside a carton box. I have removed one star because of unsatisfactory delivery.; It's a must to have a lens for all the content creators as it comes with really wide aperture for that Natural Bokeh. But we need to have atleast variable aperture or some additional features at this price.; just the best lens for its value; apt for both landscape and potrait. even though I have my dedicated potrait lens, it has become my primary lens for all the situations. one lens for all.; Best quality; its perfect for vlogging , good enough of field of view , and doest distort in the center; Bottomline up front: This is a great, ""wide angle"" lens for a really nice price

To be up front, I'm no professional photographer or videographer, so I may not be as critical as the professionals. But, I do know that with this lens, my Sony FX30 takes great video, and even pictures--at least to my eye. Since I have it on an APC-C sensor camera, I understand it's like having a 24mm full frame, but it's still ""wide angle."" It mounts perfectly and works well with my FX30. I use it primarily for talking head and POV tutorial videos, and it works great for these purposes. It is a bit ""big"" relative to some other lenses of similar focal lengths, and for my use cases, that's not an issue. The build looks and feels quality as well--it's a good looking lens! I'd definitely recommend if you're looking for a wide angle, fast lens from a known, reliable brand...for a very reasonable price!!

Pros:
- Works great with camera (Sony FX30 in my case)
- Clear, sharp images
- Fast aperture
- Nice bokeh
- Solid feel and build

Cons:
- Can feel a bit ""big"" compared to other similar lenses; Uso este lente en mas de el 80% de mi trabajo y me ha salido muy bueno, a buen precio y con excelente calidad; Qualidade da lente perfeita uso pra tudo; The autofocus performance is amazing, and wow it is so comfortable focusing at almost any distance! Just used it at my desk to walk someone through some detail work modding arcade buttons and I was able to freely move individual parts just inches from the lens to show specifics and pull back again to do more work, and each time it found me and focused on what was important right away.

Absolutely drinks light, and the image is wonderfully sharp. I am no pro photographer, but I have to say that all the reviews I watched for this thing hyping it up didn't even do it justice. My only regret is not buying it a few years back when it was a few hundred less expensive, but I was lucky enough to mostly get it using gift cards.

EXCELLENT video and photography lens on my a6000.; Incredibly high quality sharp images and video! A must have in your arsenal whether you‚Äôre just starting or have plenty experience :)"

But speed same as G master 1.4 lens. If you are looking for high speed focusing lens then go for Batis lens. It's really amazing. Can't beats its speed.
But if you are looking budget friendly best quality lens then this sigma is best option.; I'm absolutely in love with this lens, the bokeh is perfect and every image is super crisp and vibrant. I've used the g-master and actually prefer this lens over it. It's a bit heavy but personally I like the weight and feel. Incredible quality and a great value all around. If you've been thinking about a 50 1.4 this is it!; I ordered this lens to shoot my CrossFit box‚Äôs Murp WOD and got it overnight to shoot with it straight out of the box with my a7RV. I rented the Sony 50mm f/1.2 GM a few weeks ago, but I couldn‚Äôt pull the trigger to purchase such an expensive lens as an amateur photographer despite how amazing it was to use. But, I needed a nifty fifty, so I took the plunge on the Sigma 50mm f/1.4. I am so happy I did! The image quality is fantastic, the autofocus is very snappy, and the build quality feels great. Sure, it may not be the bokeh monster of the f/1.2, but it still renders lovely, and my bank account appreciates the $1k+ savings. I haven‚Äôt used the Sony 50mm f/1.4, but it‚Äôs hard to imagine it performs much better than this lens. This lens is a bargain approaching a steal. I‚Äôm very happy with my Sigma purchase!; Sigma non si smentisce ed anche questa ultima realizzazione (ART DG DN) del 50mm f1,4 √® eccellente. Nitidezza ottima gi√† a f1,4 con sfocato reso in maniera piacevole, autofocus veloce, vignettatura presente ma non eccessiva a f 1,4 e f2 poi diminuisce sensibilmente, aberrazioni cromatiche e flare ben controllati. Consigliatissimo!!!; Es hat nicht die Bildqualit√§t des 85-mm-Sigma Art, ist aber besser als das 50-mm-Zeiss von Sony. Das 50-mm-Zeiss ist teurer und der Autofokus ist superlangsam. Ich denke, dieses neue Sigma 50-mm ist das gleiche wie das 55-mm-Zeiss. Aber das neue Sigma 50 mm hat den Vorteil von F1,4 gegen√ºber dem Zeiss 55, das nur bis F 1,8 √∂ffnet. Der Autofokus des neuen Sigma ist deutlich schneller und leiser, allerdings gef√§llt mir die Qualit√§t des alten Sigma 50mm 1.4 Art besser. Was mir am alten Sigma 50mm nicht gef√§llt, ist, dass es zu schwer ist. Wenn ich genug Geld habe, werde ich mir nat√ºrlich das neue 50mm GM F1.4 oder F1.2 von Sony kaufen :) IG: @cesarromero19; Êú¨ÂΩì„Å´Á¥†Êô¥„Çâ„Åó„ÅÑ„É¨„É≥„Ç∫„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ

I personally own a few other lens from Nikon ,including telephoto zoom ,kit and prime . If you are really into photography then going for a prime lens would be a wise decision . Also a 50mm prime lens is always recommended because it will give you a better bokeh effect (in some cases) .You just have to stand a few feet away from the object to take a perfect shot.

#IMAGE QUALITY:
This lens is hands down amazing. Paired with my D3200, it really does offer stunning photos. The autofocus is fast and accurate, however sometimes focus seems to stray from my subject. The first thing you will notice about this lens over the 1.8D is that color are so much more vivid. Because I had to manually focus with the 1.8D, photos weren't always tack sharp. This lens is very sharp. The best part about it is that its way sharper than the 1.8D at wider apertures. I mainly shoot from f2.2 - f2.8 and sharpness kills the 1.8D.

#BETTER BOKEH EFFECT:
Bokeh is the background blur you see in DSLR shots. Nowadays you can create a good bokeh effect using software itself. But trust me prime lens bokeh looks way more natural, accurate and PERFECT.So if you want that really smooth and creamy bokeh, this lens is the way to go.

#REASONS TO BUY
- takes PHENOMENAL portraits
-This lens does incredibly well in low-light situations, especially if you keep it at the lowest aperture and low shutter speed.
- Perfectly usable wide-open (unlike the 1.8D)
- Very sharp with The ‚ÄúSLR Look‚Äù
- Little to no flaring
- Excellent color reproduction and contrast
- True professional performance for very little money
- Built like a plastic tank
-Macro Photography: (hack:))reverse the lens and hold it near the body of the camera.
- Fits well in the hand and is very light
- Well thought out ergonomics
- Manual focus override of AF
- Great lens hood

Cons:
- Small amount of barrel distortion
- Only stops down to f/16 (the 1.8D went to f/22)
- Slight play in the manual focus (manual override makes up for this)
- Distance scale could be better
- AF could be faster

Overall the Nikon 50mm 1.8G is a photographer‚Äôs friend, offering speed, fun, creativity and awesome quality images. This lens is a versatile, quick reach companion for any photographer‚Äôs lens collection.I would highly recommend this if you are getting serious about your photography and also for casual shots.

Thanks for reading.I hope my review provided all the information for a well informed and wise purchase decision.
Hope it helps!

Abraham; Best lens for portrait photography. Equally important for amateur and pro. Great stunning pictures captured. It is a must for every photography enthusiasts. Don't wait and go for it. But only for the price if it drop to max Rs 15k it will do wonder.; It's nice lens . Pics captured by this lens is also good. But i am facing trouble after a month. I used this Lens for almost 10 -15 times. Now it's not able to do autofocus. And also now not mounting on camera. So please suggest me how can i repair and avial warranty. Please help Amazon team.; Let's not beat around the bush - If you are a budding photographer or a serious hobbyist, there are not many things you can do better than to buy this lens. With kit lens, a telephoto and a prime lens, you got all the basic tools to learn and enjoy photography at the same time. So the question for most will not be yes or no, but when and what.

35mm or 50mm?
There are situations where it is easier to get away from the subject than to come closer. You will struggle with this lens if you regularly shoot photographs within confined spaces but in open areas extra 15mm is a bliss. 50mm is better built and supports full frame cameras. I also learned the bokeh is better on this one.

How much shallow depth of field?
With 1.8 Aperture you get pretty shallow with DoF. Attached pics will better illustrate this.

Pros:

1. 1.8 Aperture is a revelation for first timers. This opens host of new possibilities.
2. Built quality is excellent.
3. In built focus motor for starter DSLRs.
4. Fast Autofocus.
5. Ability to experiment with fast shutter speeds in daytime without losing light at 1.8G. Try catching raindrops, puff of dust, spilling water and what not!
6. Fixed optics give sharp images.
7. Great low light performance. Gives you freedom from high ISO by combining slow shutter speeds and large apertures.
8. Bokeh makes a debut in sub 10k lens!
9. Your introduction to Aperture priority mode which would be least used with your kit lens so far.

Cons:
50mm is not suitable for shooting in confined spaces or cramped indoors. Group pics will be a big no no.
No IS. Although large aperture allows you high shutter speeds. Above 1/60 you won't notice any shakes.

Highly recommended.; Good quality bokek effect; This lens was bought to complement the Nikon 18-200 VR II that I use with a D5200, which is a superlative lens in itself. With this DX format body, this 50mm lens has an effective focal length of about 70-75mm, making it a great lens for portraits and low-light general photography, to take full advantage of its large aperture for both bokeh and relatively lower ISO settings. It's an excellent lens offering crisp high-contrast images with very little distortion.

The other main use I had in mind was to use the fairly low minimum focussing distance and large aperture for macro nature photos. I find a dedicated macro lens impractical while shooting in natural light, and previous experiments with an old 18-55 kit lens that came with my first DSLR (a D3000) has shown me that it doesn't really take a dedicated macro lens for good photos as long as you don't plan extreme macros. I haven't yet had the time to use this lens for macros, but from the general results, I don't think I will be disappointed.

My final opinion: Excellent results, and a greatly useful and reasonably priced lens to always be part of your kit.; I have never found a Nikon lens I did not like. This one is great for portraits at a reasonable price. The f 1.8 is perfect for shallow depth of field for portraits (great bokeh) or night sky photography without spending an arm and two legs on a f 1.4 lens; I bought this because the auto focus for my Nikon D, but is much better than the AF 50mm 1:1.8 without autofocus. This is brighter and clearer and the obtained photos are more balanced. The auto focus is quick enough to take photos in social events but maybe not for sports. Still manual focus can do the job. For my opinion, great value for money.; Un mes con usando el Lente 50mm 1.8G en mi vieja c√°mara APSC(sensor recortado) y ning√∫n inconveniente m√°s que la bayoneta se sinti√≥ algo ajustada la primera vez que lo coloqu√©, entr√≥ un poquito forzado como que le falt√≥ pulirlo.

Il incarne la fusion parfaite entre polyvalence et qualit√©. Plut√¥t que d'opter pour plusieurs objectifs bon march√©, investir dans celui-ci a chang√© ma perspective photographique de mani√®re significative.

Une vraie r√©volution dans ma pratique photographique ! üì∑‚ú®üëå; Per il mio lavoro √® necessario usare un super zoom, e qualitativamente di solito sono ottiche tremende.
Tamron stavolta mi ha stupito. Ha una nitidezza impressionante per essere un 28-200, un bokeh pi√π che accettabile, √® compatto e leggero.
Davvero fenomenale.
L‚Äôautofocus √® perfetto da 28 a 150 mm circa, poi fa un po‚Äô pi√π fatica ma √® comunque accettabilissimo.
Lo ricomprerei 100 volte.; Ich konnte das Tamron im Dezember 2021 als Angebot f√ºr unter 700 Euro erwerben. Nachdem ich schon l√§nger mit dem Objektiv gelieb√§ugelt hatte, war der Preis dann zugegeben auch endlich ausschlaggebend f√ºr den Kauf.
Ziel war es meinen Linsen-Fuhrpark deutlich zu verkleinern. Meine Fotoausr√ºstung f√ºhrte auf Flugreisen regelm√§√üig zu Schwei√üausbr√ºchen beim Check-in, weil das Handgep√§ck durch die vielen Linsen regelm√§√üig deutlich zu schwer war. Nun sollte es f√ºr meine Sony A7rII also ein m√∂glichst kompaktes, qualitativ gutes Objektiv sein, welches m√∂glichst viele Brennweiten abdeckt und einigerma√üen Lichtstark ist. Ein klassisches Reisezoom also. Das Tamron bot sich hier geradezu an.

Beim Auspacken war ich dann auch von der Verarbeitung sehr angetan. Die Gr√∂√üe entspricht in etwa einer Bierdose, das Gewicht ebenso. Wer kein Bier mag, kann zum Vergleich auch eine 0,5 Liter Dose eines beliebigen Softdrinks zum Vergleich heranziehen.
Das Objektiv ist spritzwassergesch√ºtz, der Fokusring l√§uft wie Butter, der Zoomring d√ºrfte f√ºr meinen Geschmack etwas geschmeidiger laufen. Obwohl haupts√§chlich Kunststoff, f√ºhlt sich das Tamron hochwertig an.
Ein AF/MF Schalter w√§re wirklich w√ºnschenswert gewesen, aber ich habe mir einen gut platzierten Knopf an der Kamera programmiert. Dennoch, ich mag Fokusschalter am Objektiv.

Die Brennweiten gehen in Ordnung. Der Weitwinkel h√§tte nat√ºrlich gerne noch etwas gr√∂√üer ausfallen d√ºrfen, 24mm w√§ren hier toll f√ºr Landschaften gewesen, aber daf√ºr habe ich noch mein Sony 20mm. Wenn mir die 200mm nicht ausreichen, nutze ich ab und zu den APS-C Modus und verl√§ngere bei immer noch ausreichenden Pixeln per Knopfdruck auf 300mm.

Kritik am Autofokus kann ich nicht nachvollziehen. Der Autofokus funktioniert bei mir leise, schnell und pr√§zise. Als ich in diesem Jahr wieder auf einem dreit√§gigen Festival fotografieren durfte, entschied ich nach dem ersten Abend, alle andere Linsen im Koffer zu lassen. In meinen Augen war der AF, bei den doch sehr schwierigen Lichtbedingungen, beinahe fehlerfrei. Der Ausschuss hielt sich absolut in Grenzen und einige mir bekannte Fotografen waren gezwungen manuell zu fokussieren. Als perfekte Sportlinse w√ºrde ich das Objektiv nicht bezeichnen, aber daf√ºr ist es nun auch nicht wirklich gedacht.

Die Lichtst√§rke ist nat√ºrlich nicht √ºberm√§√üig und wenn man gew√∂hnt war, mit Teleobjektiven mit durchgehend Blende 2.8 zu fotografieren, ist das ein gewisser R√ºckschritt. Nicht aber, wenn man wie bei der A7rII einfach etwas an der ISO drehen kann und den genialen Bildstabilisator von Sony im Geh√§use hat. Da d√ºrften die neueren A7er Modelle noch viel weniger Probleme haben, da Rauschen und Stabilisator ja stetig verbessert wurden. Und mal ehrlich, soooo schlecht sind F5.6 bei 200mm auch wieder nicht. Das Bokkeh kann sich auch immer noch sehen lassen und mag mir gefallen.

Verzerrungen halten sich ebenfalls in Grenzen, Flares bei Gegenlicht sind selten und die Sch√§rfe geht auch bei Offenblende absolut in Ordnung. Bildfehler, die nicht mit einfachen Mitteln in Lightroom zu beseitigen w√§ren, hatte ich bisher so gut wie gar nicht.

Als Fazit w√ºrde ich dieses Objektiv jedem empfehlen, der mit m√∂glichst wenig Gep√§ck und Gewicht, viel Brennweite, scharfe Bilder und eine f√ºr die meisten Situation ausreichende Lichtst√§rke haben m√∂chte. Dazu ist das Objektiv preislich attraktiv und wettergesch√ºtzt. Bestimmt gibt es f√ºr die meisten Brennweiten bessere Spezialisten und das Tamron ist keine Eierlegendewollmilchsau, kommt dem aber schon sehr nah. F√ºr mich wird es auf Reisen erstmal nur dieses Tamron und mein 20mm Sony geben.

F√ºnf Sterne daf√ºr, weil die Konkurrenz zu diesem Preis, in dieser Kategorie, momentan nichts besseres zu bieten hat."

not worth the money, hyped product.
Do not waste your money on this as I did. Not as per expectation.; Es el mejor lente que hay en el mercado, todas las fotografias son excelentes. Si vas a comprar equipo fotografico, no puedes de comprar el mejor lente, la c√°mara no es tan importante.

Estoy feliz, con la estetica, funcionamiento, construcci√≥n, calidad, y claridad.; Objetivo de gran calidad y luminosidad, muy √∫til para fotografiar edificios, interiores o paisajes. No es demasiado pesado, una vez puesto en la c√°mara parece m√°s ligero. F√°cil de utilizar y gran calidad de imagen.; Using on an A7iii - absolutely beautiful lens. Not cheap, however the lens is pretty awesome to say the least; C'est mon objectif pr√©f√©r√© sur les boitiers plein format Sony ! Je suis en effet venu au FF par manque d'angle et de capacit√© en basse luminosit√©, d'abord sur les bridges puis sur l'APS-C. En effet pour moi, avant m√™me le piqu√© et le bokeh, c'est bien le fait de tout avoir dans le cadre et de le prendre quand je le souhaite qui m'importe (je pense en particulier aux photos d'int√©rieur comme dans des monuments de type cath√©drale, mais aussi).
Du coup √† la base quand je suis pass√© √† l'A7R II j'avais pris le 16-35 f4 () pensant qu'il serait suffisant, mais non f4 ne me convenait, j'√©tais trop souvent limit√© en basse luminosit√© (je prends mes photos √† 95% √† main lev√© et ne veux pas m'emb√™ter syst√©matiquement avec un tr√©pied). Du coup j'avais compl√©t√© avec le Samyanf 14mm f2.8 () qui me permettait de gagner un peu d'angle en plus. Mais un objectif fixe, pour quelqu'un venant comme moi du bridge et des zoom x15/20, c'est juste ultra frustrant. Au final il suffisait de changer d'objectif, certes, mais encore une fois, quand on vient du bridge on a beaucoup de mal √† trimballer une collection d'objectifs et √† faire les changements quand il le faut.
Du coup j'ai revendu ces deux objectifs et ai un peu cass√© la tirelire pour ce 16-35GM f2.8 (ET PAS f2.6 COMME INDIQU√â DANS LE TITRE DE L'ANNONCE) qui est vraiment g√©nial ! Par rapport au 16-35 f4, j'ai gagn√© non seulement en basses lumi√®res mais √©galement en piqu√©, et par rapport au Samyang 14mm j'ai gagn√© en distorsion et en flexibilit√©. Je ne regrette vraiment pas mon achat, cette optique √©tant celle qui est le plus souvent mont√©e en voyage, en partculier en visite, en ville et en int√©rieur je n'am√®ne que lui. Si on part pour une balade o√π on risque de voir des bestioles ou des choses au loin √† prendre, je passe le 24-240 sur le bo√Ætier et garde le 16-35GM dans le sac au cas o√π j'ai un super point de vue type panorama !
Ci-dessous quelques exemples de photos avec cet objectif coupl√© √† l'A7 III. Vous trouverez la galerie compl√®te avec les photos (en JPEG tout auto, aucune retouche) en qualit√© maxi et t√©l√©chargeables (si vous voulez vous amuser √† les retoucher vous-m√™me justement) dans le test que j'vaais de l'A7 III, disponible sur mon site internet et ma cha√Æne Youtube (leurs liens se trouvant dans mon profil en cliquant sur mon pseudo). ;); Um das Objektiv f√ºr mich einsch√§tzen zu k√∂nnen, habe ich es gegen mein Tamron 15-30mm 2.8 und gegen das Sigma 35mm 1.4 an der Nikon D810 verglichen. Da ich auch Zugriff auf das FE 12-24mm F4 und FE ZA16-35mm F4 hatte, flossen die Erfahrungswerte in diese Rezension mit ein. Auch meine kurze Bekanntschaften mit dem Nikon AFS 24mm F1.8 (sch√§rfste Festbrennweite mit 24mm f√ºr F-Mount) an der D810 und dem Sigma 24mm ART F1.4 an Metabones IV und a7r2 flie√üen mit ein. Bei s√§mtlichen Fotobeispielen im DSLR Forum ( nach ""t34ra Sony FE 16-35mm F2.8 GM"" googeln) wurden die Korrektur Funktionen in der Kamera (a7r2) ausgeschaltet. F√ºr die Sch√§rfebeurteilung habe ich mir ausschlie√ülich RAW Dateien angeschaut, und diese wegen der Vergleichbarkeit als jpeg aus LR exportiert. Bei den Sch√§rfevergleichen sollte man immer an die m√∂gliche und vorhandene Varianz der Objektive vom gleichen Typ denken. Deswegen verstehe ich meine Vergleiche lediglich als Indikation, und nicht als absolute Wahrheit.

Kurzfassung (die Langfassung weiter unten)
1. Haptik/Handling - sehr gut mit Abz√ºgen (Wackelfilz Gegenlichtblende)
2. Flares - gut
3. Blendensterne - gut, bei Blende 8 und offener nachlassend
4. Bokehballs bei punktuellen Lichterquellen - sehr gut mit Abz√ºgen (Zwiebelringe), rund auch bei Blende 11
5. Bokeh - geht so (allerdings an dem Mindestfokussierabstand sehr gut), sonst fehlt mir etwas Sch√§rfe/Unsch√§rfebereich Separation
6. Chromatische Aberration - sehr gut sowohl im Sch√§rfe als auch im Unsch√§rfebereich
7. Eckensch√§rfe versus Randsch√§rfe - gut (Ecken kaum unsch√§rfer als die R√§nder)
8. Sch√§rfe in der Ferne - sehr gut (bei 35mm fabelhaft) mit Abz√ºgen (bei 16mm ist es nicht absolut dominant)
9. Sch√§rfe im Nahbereich - sehr gut
10. Vignettierung - ok (bei F2.8 vignettiert es schon ordentlich, das Tamron 15-30mm hat weniger Vignette)
11. Verzeichnung - ok. Das 12-24 verzeichnet etwas weniger, das Tamron bei 16mm etwas mehr.

Vorl√§ufiges Fazit
Das Objektiv hab ich so gr√ºndlich verglichen, weil es teuer ist und bei mir ggf. √ºber ein System Wechsel (Nikon -> Sony) entscheidet. Es ist aus meiner Sicht so gut, dass Festbrennweiten in den Brennweiten Bereich 16-35mm obsolet werden. Besonders die guten Ergebnisse im Vergleich zu den Festbrennweiten (Sigma 35mm Art und Nikon AFS 24mm 1.8) haben mich schon √ºberrascht.

Sicherlich sind sehr gute, lichtstarke Festbrennweiten ggf. minimalst besser hinsichtlich Aufl√∂sung, Verzeichnung, Blendensternen, Flare Resistenz und Bokeh. F√ºr den Brennweitenbereich 16 ‚Äì 35mm m√ºsste ich mehrere Festbrennweiten kaufen, die zusammengenommen mehr kosten, mehr wiegen, mehr Platz in der Fototasche belegen w√ºrden. Das Wechseln bei widrigen Witterungsverh√§ltnissen (Sturm, Staub, Gischt, Regen, etc.) birgt nat√ºrlich Gefahren f√ºr die Elektronik und den Sensor. Die Spielerei mit unterschiedlichen Filterdurchmessern, verschiedenen Adapterringen kann ebenfalls umst√§ndlich sein. Das GM Zoom schafft die oben genannte Nachteile ab und bietet dazu eine enorme Bildsch√§rfe. Auch bei den o.g. Kriterien geht das Zoom aus meiner Sicht keine gro√üen Kompromisse ein.

Als Landschaft, (Sport) Reportage, Urlaubs Objektiv ist es trotz des hohen Preises eine sehr gute Alternative und in der gesamten KB Landschaft sicherlich das beste UWW Zoom Objektiv. Eingesetzt an Sony A7SII, A7II, A7RII, A9 Geh√§use ist es zudem stabilisiert, was die Vielseitigkeit nochmals erh√∂ht. Es ist schon ein Unterschied, ob ich bei 35mm konzentriert mit 1/60sek. Belichtungszeit freih√§ndig fotografiere, oder ob ich stressfrei 1/10sek. - 1/15sek. Belichtungszeit nutzen kann und sehr scharfe Ergebnisse erhalte.

Der einzige negative Beigeschmack ist das Bokeh. Das finde ich trotz der vollmundigen Aussagen in diversen Tests unter meinen Erwartungen. Ich vermisse etwas den ‚Äûr√§umlichen‚Äú Eindruck. Und das hat nicht nur mit der theoretischen Sch√§rfentiefe zu tun.
Der negative Aspekt mit der Gegenlichtblende st√∂rt mich zwar, hat aber keine Gewichtung.

Umfangreiche Bildvergleiche (Sch√§rfe, Bokeh, Verzeichnung, Blendensterne, Flares, etc.) habe ich im DSLR Forum gepostet. Einfach nach ""t34ra Sony FE 16-35mm F2.8 GM"" googeln.

Langfassung

1. Haptik/Handling
Der Kunststoff, der f√ºr die Au√üenh√ºlle verwendet worden ist, f√ºhlt sich gut an und wird wohl bei l√§ngerer Nutzung keine Abriebspuren zeigen, wie bei vielen anderen FE Objektive mit ihren Metallh√ºllen. Beim Objektiv wackelt weder der Brennweiten, noch der Fokusring. Die Ringe laufen gut dosiert. Der manuelle Fokus l√§sst sich dosierter einsetzen, als bei den fr√ºheren Sony/ZA Objektiven. Das Objektiv ist kleiner und leichter als die lichtstarke UWW Konkurrenz. Der AF ist relativ schnell und pr√§zise.
An der Gegenlichtblende fallen mir zwei negative Aspekte auf: sie wackelt minimal (von mehreren Besitzern best√§tigt) und hat innen eine Filzbeschichtung. Nach einigen rein und raus aus der Fototasche heften Staub, H√§rchen bzw. sonstige Fremdk√∂rper an. M√∂chte schlie√ülich keine Fusselrolle in die Fototasche packen. F√ºr mich ein Minuspunkt.

2. Flares
Habe einige Aufnahmen an sonnigen Nachmittagen gemacht. Das GM schl√§gt sich √§hnlich wie das Tamron 15-30mm, es ist nicht flarefrei. Aber welches Objektiv ist es schon? Bei meinen vielen Gegenlichtaufnahmen aus unterschiedlichen Perspektiven sind mir keine derart prominente, kreisrunde Flares, wie z.B.: bei dem FE 12-24mm F4 oder bei dem Irix 15mm F2.4 gelungen.

3. Blendensterne
Die 22 armige Blendensterne sind bei Blende 11 und 16 sehr angenehm. Ab Blende 8 nachlassend. Nicht ganz auf dem Niveau der Sigma Art, Loxia, neuer Nikon 1.8er, Voigtl√§nder Festbrennweiten, aber verglichen mit UWW Zooms von Nikon eine deutliche Steigerung. Minimal besser als beim Tamron 15-30mm F2.8 und besser als bei den FE 12-24mm F4 und FE ZA16-35mm F4.

4. Bokehballs bei punktuellen Lichterquellen
Ich testete wie das GM sich wohl in abendlichen, n√§chtlichen Szenarien (Weihnachtsmarkt, Konzert, Events) bzw. Innenr√§umen (Kirchen mit Kerzenlicht, etc.) machen wird, wenn im Nahbereich fotografiert wird. Wie werden die Lichtquellen im Unsch√§rfebereich aussehen?

Im Vergleich zum Sigma 35mm F1.4 ART bei Blende 11, sehen die Balls beim GM in etwa gleich aus. Zwiebelringe sind sichtbar und leicht ausgefranste R√§nder. Blende 8 gef√§llt mir das GM besser, der Rand ist harmonischer und runder. Da zahlen sich die 11 Lamellen aus. Blende 5.6 ebenfalls. Bei Blende 4 und 2.8 macht Sigma gr√∂√üere Balls, daf√ºr nicht so rund und etwas unruhiger. Insgesamt machen die GM Balls einen etwas runderen und harmonischeren Eindruck, obwohl sie minimal kleiner ausfallen und geringf√ºgig mehr Zwiebelringe aufweisen. Zum einen haben sie weniger Farbs√§ume am Rand auf, zum anderen sind die R√§nder etwas ruhiger.

Verglichen mit dem Tamron 15-30mm F2.8 finde ich die Bokehballs homogener und ruhiger. Auch die R√§nder sind beim GM delikater. Hier gef√§llt mir das GM deutlich besser. Die Tamron Balls sind zwar gr√∂√üer und auch nicht auffallend eckig, aber die Zwiebelringe bzw. die ungleichm√§√üige F√ºllung macht sie unruhig.

Sony wirbt f√ºr das Objektiv mit folgender Eigenschaft ‚ÄûZirkul√§re Blende mit 11 Lamellen f√ºr wundersch√∂ne Unsch√§rfe-Effekte‚Äú. Hier kommt sie zur Geltung.

5. Bokeh
Ein recht subjektives Thema. Im absoluten Nahbereich an dem Mindestfokussierabstand (28cm) ist das Bokeh/Sch√§rfeverlauf bzw. der visuelle ‚Äû3D Eindruck‚Äú beim GM Zoom dem Sigma 35mm F1.4 ART √ºberlegen. Im Vergleich zum Tamron 15-30mm und 30mm finde ich das GM bei Offenblende sch√∂ner, bei geschlosseneren Blenden finde ich das Tamron minimal attraktiver.

Die enorme Sch√§rfe des Objektivs, der geringe Mindestfokussierabstand und Blende 2.8 ergibt eine recht attraktive M√∂glichkeit die kleinen Dinge des Lebens abzulichten und aus ihren Umfeld zu separieren.

Im Nahbereich (1,5m 2,5m) finde ich das Bokeh durchwachsen. Im Vergleich zum Sigma 35mm F1.4 Art, w√ºrde ich bei gleichen Blenden an beiden Objektiven, jeweils das Sigma bevorzugen. Irgendwie wirkt die Unsch√§rfe sch√∂ner beim Sigma. Die Bilder sind plastischer.

Im Vergleich zum Tamron 15-30mm F2.8 wirkt bei Offenblende des GM‚Äôs und 30mm ruhiger. Das Tamron hat einen kriseligen Unsch√§rfebereich an den Seiten. Bei geschlosseneren Blenden finde ich wiederrum das Tamron minimal besser.

Insgesamt macht das Bokeh des GM‚Äôs auf mich einen mittelm√§√üigen Eindruck. Ich h√§tte nach den Lobeshymnen auf das Bokeh in den ‚Äûprofessionellen‚Äú Reviews doch mehr erwartet. Entweder wiederholen die Tester die Werbeslogans vom Sony oder sie haben einen anderen Bokeh Geschmack als ich.

6. CA - chromatische Aberration
Hier verh√§lt sich das GM vorbildlich (die Korrektur in der Kamera war aus). Sowohl im Sch√§rfebereich, als auch im Unsch√§rfebereich gibt es kaum CA‚Äôs. Sehr erfreulich. An scharfen Kanten lassen sich die CA‚Äôs mit einem Klick in vielen Programmen entfernen. Im Unsch√§rfebereich muss viel manuell korrigiert werden, es ist zum Teil zeitraubend oder gar unm√∂glich. Jeder, der schon mit den g√ºnstigen, modernen 1.8er Festbrennweiten von Nikon offenblendig fotografiert hat, ‚Äûfreut‚Äú sich √ºber die h√§sslichen gr√ºnen R√§nder im Unsch√§rfebereich. Hier ist das Sony Zoom wirklich sehr gut.

7. Eckensch√§rfe versus Randsch√§rfe
Wie die Ecken im Vergleich zum Rand hinsichtlich Sch√§rfe ausfallen, hatte ich fr√ºher nicht beachtet. Aber bei planen Fl√§chen (z.B. Fotos von Geb√§uden) bzw. Landschaft (K√ºstenfotos mit Felsen/Kiesel Vordergrund) macht es durchaus Sinn, diesen Aspekt ebenfalls zu ber√ºcksichtigen.
In dieser Disziplin finde ich das GM ebenfalls gut. Es gibt kaum in der Randsch√§rfe und Eckensch√§rfe.

8. Sch√§rfe auf weite Entfernungen > 20m und Fokussierung auf Unendlich
Im Vergleich zum Tamron 15-30mm F2.8 kann das Tamron bei der maximalen UWW Stellung in der Mitte bei Blende 8 und 5.6 mithalten, bei Blende 4 und 2.8 ist das Tamron sogar besser als das GM. Allerdings war es das mit der gleichen Augenh√∂he, ich sehe das GM bei allen anderen Brennweiten mal deutlich mal weniger deutlich vorne. Bei 30mm ist das Sony Zoom schon deutlich besser als das Tamron.

Im Vergleich zu dem FE ZA16-35mm ist das GM in der Mitte minimal besser als das 4er Zoom. Am Rand ist das 4er Zoom bei Blende 5.6 und 4 minimalst besser, dar√ºber das GM Zoom. Bei 20mm ist das GM lediglich am Rand bei Blende 4 etwas schlechter. 24mm sind in der Mitte bei dem GM besser, lediglich ist der Rand bei Blende 4 und 5.6 etwas schlechter. Bei 30mm ist das GM √ºberall besser, bei Blende 2.8 ist das GM sch√§rfer als das 4er Zoom bei Blende 4. Bei 35mm ist das GM derart dem 4er Zoom in allen Bereichen √ºberlegen, dass ich dazu nur ‚Äûkrass‚Äú sagen kann.

Im Vergleich zum FE 12-24mm F4 ist das GM bei 16mm minimalst besser als das kleine Super UWW Zoom. Am Rand macht das FE 12-24mm F4 eine sehr gute Figur und schl√§gt das GM Zoom. Je l√§nger die Brennweite eingestellt ist, desto besser wird das GM. Bei 24mm ist das GM in der Mitte deutlicher vorne, auch am Rand ist es entweder gleich oder nur minimalst schlechter als das 12-24mm F4 Zoom.

Im Vergleich zum Sigma 35mm F1.4 Art macht das Sony Zoom in der Mitte eine ‚Äûsch√§rfere‚Äú Figur. Am Rand ist das Sigma ab F8 minimalst besser, darunter 8F5.6, F4, F2.8) das GM Zoom.

Im Vergleich zum Nikon 24mm 1.8 ist das das GM bei Blende 2.8 minimalst schlechter. Bei allen anderen Blenden sehe ich minimalsten Vorteil f√ºr das GM oder gleiche Sch√§rfe. Am Rand sehe ich das GM bei allen Blenden au√üer 2.8 minimalst vorne. Bei Blende 2.8 ist das Nikon minimal besser.

Im Vergleich zum Sigma 24mm ART F1.4 (an Metabones IV und a7r2) ist das GM Zoom ist in der Mitte durchgehend etwas sch√§rfer, bei Blende 11 und 2.8 ist der Vorteil am besten sichtbar. Auch am Rand ist das Zoom durchgehend sch√§rfer. Ab Blende 5.6 ist der Unterschied deutlich, bei Blende 2.8 ist das Sigma im Vergleich zum GM katastrophal. Ich bekam den Hinweis, dass das Auflagema√ü bei Metabones Adapter nicht mit dem nativen Auflagema√ü (in dem Fall EF Mount) √ºbereinstimmt, und es deswegen zu einer Degradierung der Bildsch√§rfe f√ºhrt. Der MC-11 von Sigma soll besser sein, daf√ºr ist der AF an der Sony a7r2 schlechter. Mein Problem bei den Adaptionen: Zu der √ºblichen Sch√§rfevarianz bei dem Objektiven kommt nun auch die Varianz bei den unterschiedlichsten Adaptern und unterschiedliche Verhalten nach Firmware Updates. Es nervt. Deswegen w√ºrde ich bei der mittlerweile ansehnlichen Palette an nativen FE Objektiven einfach drauf verzichten.

9. Sch√§rfe im Nahbereich 2-3m
Genauso wichtig wie der Sch√§rfeeindruck auf Unendlich (oder noch wichtiger) ist die Sch√§rfe im Nahbereich. Bei UWW und WW will ich den Vordergund present und sehr scharf haben, die Berge 1000m dahinter k√∂nnen ruhig eine nur akzeptable Sch√§rfe haben. Deswegen habe ich die o.g. Objektive im Nahbereich verglichen.

Im Vergleich zum Tamron 15-30mm F2.8 ist das GM bei 16mm dem Tamron in der Mitte deutlich √ºberlegen. Am Rand schl√§gt sich das Tamron fast so gut wie das GM. Bei 20mm ist das GM in der Mitte ebenfalls deutlich √ºberlegen. Am Rand kann Tamron nur bei Blende 2.8 mithalten, sonst ist das GM zum Teil deutlich sch√§rfer. Bei 24mm ist das GM mittig bei Blende 11 deutlich sch√§rfer als das Tamron, je weiter die Blende aufgeht, desto geringer die Unterschiede. Bei Blende 2.8 finde ich das Tamron minimalst besser. Am Rand und 30mm ist das GM nur etwas besser als das Tamron. Bei Blende 4 finde ich das Tamron etwas besser. Bei 30mm ist das GM mittig durchgehend etwas sch√§rfer als das Tamron, bei f4 und f2.8 etwas deutlicher. Am Rand ist das GM durchgehend sch√§rfer als das Tamron. Bei Blende 2.8 deutlich sch√§rfer.

Im Vergleich zum FE ZA16-35mm F4 ist das GM bei 16mm in der Mitte durchgehend etwas sch√§rfer. Am Rand ist das GM zum Teil deutlich sch√§rfer. Auch hier ist Blende 2.8 sch√§rfer als Blende 4 beim 4er. Bei 20mm ist das GM in der Mitte minimal sch√§rfer, und am auch Rand sehe ich das GM durchgehen etwas vorne. Bei 24mm ist das GM mittig nur bei Blende 11 sch√§rfer. Je weiter die Blende aufgeht, desto geringer sind die Sch√§rfe Unterschiede. Die Objektive sind dann etwa gleich scharf. Am Rand gef√§llt mir das GM nur bei Blende 11 etwas besser. Blende 8 ist in etwa gleich. Blende 4 und 5.6 gef√§llt mir beim 4er minimalst besser, als beim GM. Bei 30mm und Blende 11 ist das GM in der Mitte schon sch√§rfer. Bei 8 und 5.6 schwindet der Vorteil. Blende 4 ist in etwa gleich scharf. Am Rand Finde ich das GM nur bei Blende 11 sch√§rfer. Ansonsten gef√§llt mir das 4er durchgehend etwas besser. Bei 35mm mittig machen beide Objektive den gleichen Eindruck. Au√üer bei Blende 4, da ist das GM etwas sch√§rfer. Am Rand ist das GM minimal sch√§rfer, bei Blende 5.6 und 4 etwas deutlicher. Blende 2.8 ist besser als Blende 4 am 4er Zoom. Bei dieser Brennweite war das GM auf Unendlich super gut, im Nahbereich verliert es hier an Dominanz.

Im Vergleich zum FE 12-24mm F4 ist das GM in der Mitte minimalst sch√§rfer. Am Rand ist das GM minimal sch√§rfer. Es gef√§llt mir einen Hauch besser als das FE 12-24. Auf Unendlich war es komplett anders. Das FE12-24 war dort zum Teil deutlich besser als das GM. Bei 20mm ist die Mitte beim GM etwas sch√§rfer. Am Rand ist das GM zum Teil deutlich besser. Blende 2.8 ist sogar deutlich besser als Blende 4 an dem FE12-24mm. Bei 24mm ist das GM deutlich besser als das FE12-24. Blende 2.8 ist besser als Blende 4 an dem FE12-24. Am Rand finde ich das GM zwar nicht berauschend, aber es ist schon besser als das FE12-24. Auch hier ist die Ofenblende besser als Blende 4 vom FE12-24.

Im Vergleich zum Sigma 35mm F1.4 Art ist das GM in der Mitte entweder gleich oder minimal sch√§rfer als das Sigma. Am Rand ist das Sigma bei Blende 11 und 8 minimalst sch√§rfer, ansonsten finde ich das GM minimalst vorne."

I was confused about the focal length to opt for. This lens has 40mm and also micro capabilities so I went for it as I can use it for portraits and micro both.

I was so surprised by the outputs and believe me the images that it captures looks so natural and detailed as near as an high end lens's output. I am extremely happy and satisfied with the purchase, and great job done by supplier, packaging was good and all seals intact.

Love it!; Purchased this lens from Amazon. Got it in one day, thanks to Amazon's on time delivery. I was looking for a macro lens on a budget. This 40mm DX MiCRO lens works wonders with APSC Nikon Cameras. Working with D500 myself. The images are sharp, macros are 1:1. Over all satisfied wih the lens. Good for travel photography (in place of 35mm). Only Con is that it feels cheap plasticky and the extension barrel seems delicate on focusing too close to the subject.; Outer finishing is not good, lens quality is excellent, bokeh effect for very very close (macro) is really awesome, but f2. 8 works only in Manual Or in Auto mode, depends on certain settings.
Filter settings is 52 mm, if want to use ND filters with it, to capture waterfalls etc.
Check YouTube channel 'RealWorld' (not mine), how to do it.
This is is the minimum priced macro or micro lens from Nikon, lens type AF-S mount, fits DX format cameras, check Nikon website before buying, mine is Nikon D5300.
Hope to go out and click some beautiful photos, but, due to pandemic, it is difficult.
Very small sized lens, you can keep in your over sized purse.
40 mm, in DX format x1. 5=60mm; One of the best lens from nikon family..
I have Nikon D-5600 DX body so I was confused between Nikor 35 mm f/1.5, Nikon 50 mm f/1.8 and Nikon 40 mm micro prime lens. Finally I started searching about the lens and tried to know the fact regarding usefulness of Nikon 40 mm, But did not get any one who is using Nikor 40 mm, So I decided to buy nikon 40 mm micro prime. The that was a worth decision in each term.
Sharpness ie excellen.
General purpose micro and product photoshoot.
Low light performance is excellent.
Easy to handle.
Best video quality even in low light.
Great bhoke.
Worth for each panny you spent over lens.
I got this lens from amazon at 16500/-; Great small size lens for my nikon D7500 easy to carry around lcomes with its lens case. Found it was great for close up Bokeh effect too was good. So happy for now with this lens will add to my reveiew as I use it.; Very nice macro results, good for portrait as well. Autofocus is little slow but that's ok if you see the price.; I had seen many videos of Nikon 40mm macro lens and am happy to share few of my initial clicks by this macro lens.
I shall definitely share my experience in depth after few months experience. But initially I found this lens extremely good in this price, truly this is value for money.; Great product; I was so excited to order this for my camera! As a professional it's nice to have a lens which can capture items close up. Loved the depth of field and the sharpness.; Se siente de muy buen material, por el precio es s√∫per recomendable ya que tiene la funci√≥n de macro. Llego muy bien empaquetado; I am an amateur portrait photographer who loves 85mm. I am absolutely new to macro photography. I do have a Nikon Z6 II and wanted a Nikon Z MC 105mm. After watching people in youtube taking incredible photos with Nikon Z mc 105mm lens, the hard work they put through, waking up early, camping in wilderness, I am sure I will die an amateur. But I have some trick, like an off camera flash, I am also incredibly sneaky, so right off the bat I took some very close shot and I myself became a bokeh. BTW I am using this 40mm lens on my trusty old D7100. So in summary if you are a run and gun macro shooter, easy and lite weight is your object, you need no other lens.; Excellent; Despite usine this on a full from D780, I now consider this my new avorite lens and use it about 90% of the time... It does feel a little more plastic than some of the more expensive lens I have got, but I guess you get what you pay for... As for the quality, I havent been able to fault it... Maybe one day I will get the more expensive 35mm meant for full frames, but for the time being I am more than happy with the picture quality this lens gives."

The camera's compact size makes it incredibly convenient for travel and on-the-go shooting, while the image quality is nothing short of outstanding.

The fast and accurate autofocus system is a true standout feature. It locks onto subjects with remarkable precision, ensuring I never miss a moment. Whether I'm capturing stunning landscapes or fast-moving subjects, the Sony Alpha 6100 delivers impressive results.

The flip-up touchscreen is a huge bonus for vloggers and selfie enthusiasts. It's incredibly user-friendly, and the intuitive menu system makes adjusting settings a breeze. The 4K video quality is outstanding, providing crisp and detailed footage.

Battery life has been better than expected, allowing me to shoot for extended periods without constantly worrying about recharging. The low-light performance is also commendable, producing clear and noise-free images even in challenging conditions.

In summary, the Sony Alpha 6100 is a versatile and high-performance mirrorless camera that suits both beginners and experienced photographers alike. Its compact design, superb autofocus, and excellent image quality make it a wise investment for capturing memories with precision and style. I couldn't be happier with my purchase!; After a month with this camera, I've found it to be reasonably priced compared to other mirrorless options from other brands. However, it falls short of my expectations in terms of photo quality. Coming from a Nikon DSLR background, I noticed a dullness in color reproduction, necessitating post-processing to enhance vibrancy. The 16-50 mm lens yields results similar to mobile photography, while the 55-210 mm offers a broader frame range. Despite the photographic drawbacks, this camera shines for vlogging and content creation, boasting satisfying video quality and useful features like slow-motion capability. If your focus is primarily on video work, this could be a worthy investment.

Photos I‚Äôve uploaded are taken in 55-210 mm lens and edited in photoshop application.; Switched from Nikon D3400 to Sony Alpha a6100. Loved this! Bought the dual lens combo with kit lens 16-50mm and 55-210mm telephoto.

The camera feels nice to hold, light but feels dense. Telephoto lens is a master at high ranges. Kit lens is great for wide shots.

Recieved in box:
64GB Sony SDHC card class 10, camera bag, lens cap, lens hood, charger, battery, USB type B cable, shoulder strap, viewfinder cup.

Note: The camera bag is very basic and cheaper quality.

All in all, a very nice camera. Fast autofocus, versatile and lenses have optical stabilization.; Its compact design makes it easy to carry around, while the 24.2MP sensor delivers sharp and detailed photos. The inclusion of two lenses in the kit (16-50mm and 55-210mm) provides a wide range of focal lengths for various shooting scenarios. The autofocus system is fast and accurate, making it suitable for both beginners and enthusiasts.
Package was great and intact. Camera carrying bag is decent enough to protect and carry along with the supplied accessories. Excellent Choice!; I was torn between the Sony alpha 6100, 6400 and Canon Eos R7 but then decided to go with the 6100 and save some money. The camera and kit lenses are really good. Sony‚Äôs user interface isn‚Äôt the most intuitive but once it was set up, I didn‚Äôt have to go back and forth too much. All in all, an excellent purchase.; Sometime it process slow but if you have lol bit patience it will give you the extreme satisfaction with the high quality picture. Just go for it as it‚Äôs a perfect DSLR for beginners.; Good camera sony a6100; "

Kudos to Sigma for going all out in making this a winner product. The entire combination of pieces which you get with this is show that Sigma wanted no stone unturned in creating this as an excellent value. It comes with a good quality bag and hood. So you don't need to buy the necessities.
Then coming to the product. I had used this lens in Tadoba in December. I had rented it out (which by the way was also a very good experience). I liked to performance, the built quality, the versatility, and the picture quality. One knows that this is image quality loss in telephoto lens compared to prime lens. But honestly, the did't mind the quality at all, in fact it really liked it. If it has any lesser quality than a prime of say 600 mm, then at least I didn't notice. My friends were carrying a 600 mm lens.
On the contrary, it made me realise that even if there was a quality difference between a 600 Prime and this one, I would still trade for the sheer versatility of this lens. In Wildlife, there is a big range of distance you need to cover. For e.g., one Tiger passed by our Gypsy and walked to the water hole where he sat far on the other side. This lens was able to cover all those distances. A Prime can't. And don't forget that in India wildlife safaris are a very bumpy ride. At that time, the size and the flexibility of this lens add great value. It makes it more practical.
All in all, a must have for wildelife photography, unless you are a Professional. Then you should take a Pro's advice, not mine.
Oh, and I must mention. Thanks a lot Amazon. I ordered it, it got delivered, I filed for replacement and no fuss replacement came with return item picked up. All in less than 36 hours. Amazing Customer Service!!! 5 Stars.; If you're looking to get into wildlife or astrophotography and move on from your kit lens, then this is for you. I use this lens primarily for wildlife, and the output images almost always have a WOW factor, and can turn out super dramatic.

Pros:
+ Most affordable 600mm out there
+ Superbly built with water and oil repellant coating. The lens feels rugged.
+ Sharp image quality
+ Superfast autofocus
+ Availability of zoom lock, manual focus override
+ Excellent Optical Stabilization and the option to switch it off or switch levels
+ Option to use Sigma dock to update firmware and customize a lot of lens settings
+ Crazy zoom levels if you manage to get your hands on the 1.4 extender
+ This may be subjective but the bokeh from this lens looks much better than the canon 400mm

Not so major cons:
- There is a very slight distortion towards the edges, especially at 600mm. This is barely noticeable though.
- The lens cap does really sit tight. Slight shake and it falls off.
- You're going to need really good illumination for 600mm at F6.3. It slightly falls off at high zoom levels.
- Obviously not as sharp as Canon lenses, and you can make out the softness when zooming in on a PC. More than good for casual/hobby use though.

Major cons:
- This lens is going to make your hand hurt, make no mistake. It's heavy and built like a tank. As a result, handheld shots at 600mm are not that easy.
- Add to that a zoom ring that is super tight. You have to put in a lot of effort to change zoom levels on this.
- Literally the worst packaging for such an expensive object. No outer cover or cushioning inside to prevent damage. What's worse is that the two seals on top of the package are there only for namesake. The package contents can easily be tampered with. With the box contents easily visible to everybody, it is also prone to theft during transport.

With these cons, I would still rate this as one of the best zoom lenses purely because of its price point and quality, and would recommend this to anybody looking to buy it.; Excellent product from Sigma and equally excellent delivery and shipping by Cloudtail and Amazon. Had used the 150-500mm for 7 years before upgrading to this one. Works flawlessly with the Canon 550D, 700D and 80D - should have no problem with any contemporary Canon Body. Pretty ok at F6.3 and 600mm and of course when the light is good, then it can give lenses 5 times as expensive as this a run for their money. Image quality and sharpness of the 150-600mm is surely improved from the older 150-500mm version - in most lighting scenarios you can see a noticeable difference. Optical stabilization is fast, effective and completely silent and can enable one to take photos down to 1/250s at 600mm on a crop body. Autofocus speed is good - but at 600mm F6.3 it is not the fastest out there, which is understandable. Autofocus speed can be improved if one does not rely on the Full range of the selector switch, but helping the autofocus system by selecting the likely distance to subject using the distance selector switch on the lens. Clicking small, restless birds inside foliage in low light may be a tad more difficult with this lens at 600mm than with the old one at 500mm, but that is part of the challenge of going to higher focal length as well. Autofocus accuracy is excellent and, in decent lighting conditions, is pretty much unbeatable. If combined with a slightly more capable body than a Canon 700D, one can expect pretty impressive results even at ISOs of 1600, while reaching up to 600mm with F6.3. Overall an excellent product for its price. Attached photos, apart from that of the tiger walking down, are all at 600mm on a 700D body with ISO speeds capped at 1600.; Nice product; I bought this for my Nikon D850. Love the combo. Autofocus is fast and precise. Motor is quiet. Optics are sharp and pleasing to my eyes. Colours are rich. A little heavy but that's to be expected for beast like this.; Invested in this lens in advance of a safari to Africa, and so happy I did. The image quality is fantastic! Easy to use. Image stabilization works very well. I did use it with a monopod to help with the weight and stabilization, especially at full zoom, and it worked like a charm. It is quite heavy at about 5 lbs and I had to carry it separately for that reason, but so worth it. Great quality, even in low light. Works very well with my Nikon D7100 camera.; Tengo una Canon EOS 250D y me gusta mucho hacer fotos de aves y naturaleza, llevo un tiempo usando un objetivo Canon 70-300 con buenos resultados pero se me quedaba corto en muchas ocasiones, as√≠ que me decid√≠ por comprar el Sigma 150-600. Ten√≠a miedo porque es un objetivo muy oscuro pero cuando lo he probado me ha maravillado con su calidad de imagen.
A tener en cuenta:
- Es un objetivo grande y pesado, para estar quieto en un sitio, enfocar y disparar. Colgar la c√°mara del cuello con este objetivo para ir andando con √©l no es para nada viable. Para eso tienes el 70-300.
- Se te va a hacer durillo enfocar y hacer zoom sin un tr√≠pode, aunque se puede hacer. Recomendable usar tr√≠pode si vas a estar un buen rato haciendo fotos.
- La nitidez de las im√°genes es una maravilla, lo he probado con aves peque√±as pero me falta irme a un puesto de observaci√≥n de aves. A√∫n as√≠ el resultado es muy bueno.
- En la caja viene una bolsa para transportarlo, correas para la bolsa y el objetivo, el parasol y el objetivo; Il est lourd mais fait le boulot je vous conseil le monopode ou tr√©pied.; Pour l'instant je suis satisfait de cet objectif. Mont√© sur un Nikon D500. Le pare-soleil est encombrant, je m'en passe parfois. Niveau design, ce n'est pas le plus beau, mais √† ce prix ce n'est pas la priorit√©. Bon rapport/qualit√© prix."

Con los modelos de Sony A7 hay que estar alerta en poner el SteadyShot en manual y ajustar la distancia focal, que a veces se olvida.; Uno dei pochi obiettivi che fanno davvero la differenza! Semplicemente meraviglioso!; What can you say, it‚Äôs another cracking Batis lens!

When I moved from my APSC Sony a77ii I decided I was only going to buy the very best glass available to make the most of my Sony a7ii, So far I have the Batis 85mm 1.8, Sony 70-200 f4 and now this Batis 25 f2 and my god I love these lenses.

To make this easy I will break it down rather than tell some long story.

BUILD
9.5/10

There is mixed things about the batis lenses online, however as far as I am concerned they are fantastically designed and built. Yes the lens cap is not th best ever and the hood is plastic, but lets be honest plastic is the best materials for cameras. it doesn‚Äôt feel cheap, it feels solid and well weighted, all the batis lenses are well balanced on the a7 cameras, I find the 35 2.8 sony lens way to small and hard to use, although i do always have a grip only cameras. Overall I love the lens/s and can‚Äôt fault them‚Ä¶ except that bloody rubber grip, it gets so dirty and offends my OCDs. wish it was a metal with a little texture.

OLED SCREEN
9/10

I am glad they went for OLED with this as it does help disability, however its usefulness is down to the user‚Ä¶ I think it makes much more sense on a landscape lens like this than my basis 85mm‚Ä¶ But overall its a great addition.

OPTICAL QUALITY
9.5/10

Being an f2 and a close focusing distance this is a really versatile lens. Great for low light, close up food photography and full body portraits if needed! the booked is buttery and very nice, not quite as smooth as the 85mm but that is too be expected. Overall this lens is razor sharp, from f2 down to f11 and starts to tail off at f16. Sweet spot I have found is f4 and f11 depending on your need. There is pretty much nothing I would change in this respect and it has that beautiful Zeiss pop that you just can‚Äôt explain.

ABERRATIONS AND FALLOFF
9.5

For a wide angle with a f2 apperture aberrations are present in extreme situations, but in general are very very well controlled and are as far as I am concerned a non issue. Light falloff is minimal and virtually gone at f5.6. Distorition is very slight and easily corrected.

OVERALL 9.5

I have attached a few samples and please of ask if you have any questions; Gekauft beim Fotogesch√§ft in D√ºsseldorf nach langer √úberlegung
Ist der Abstand zum 35 2,8 -was ich extrem sch√§tze ! -zu gering? sind 21mm oder 18mm nicht besser Oder Augen zu und das 16-35?
Nach meiner Erbostheit √ºber die echt m√§√üige Leistung des 24-70 im Weitwinkel (und auch bei 70mm)bei satten Aufpreis zum Kit waren meistens das 35 2,8 und das 55mm im Einsatz. Mit der Panoramafunktion der A7R gelangen auch gr√∂√üere Perspektiven recht gut .Beim zoomen ins Bild war es dann aber schon anders
Im Weitwinkel sollte jetzt auch Qualit√§t her-m√∂glichst ohne Adapter.
Zugegeben , das design des Loxia gef√§llt mir besser, aber die gr√∂√üere Offenbarende des Batis mit kurzer Naheinstellgrenze- der Autofocus-und nicht zuletzt die sehr guten Tests haben mich zuschlagen lassen.
Das Batis ist relativ kurz und volumin√∂s-auch beim Verstauen bemerkbar( ben√∂tigt halt ein etwas breiteres Fach im Fotorucksack )Daf√ºr ist das Gewicht relativ niedrig und insbesondere das Handling mit der Kamera sehr angenehm.Der gummierte Drehring hat einen satten Widerstand, die Haptik ist solide und wertig.Nach 2 Wochen mit einer Fotoreise nach Rom bin ich mit der optischen Qualit√§t sehr zufrieden.
Insbesondere der Sch√§rfeverlauf zum Rand ist sehr gut und der Bildeindruck beeindruckend.Der Autofocus hat mich nicht entt√§uscht, wobei man bei dem gro√üen Bildfeld schon ein klares Ziel anbieten mu√ü-sonst wird es die Baumreihe dahinter- oder wie im Petersdom ein anderer S√§ulengang
Erstaunlich gut fand ich auch den Bildeindruck im Hochkantpanorama aus der Kamera-ohne Fehl und Tadel.
F√ºr 1300 Euro erh√§lt man ein solides und optisch sehr gutes Objektiv mit praktischen features und einem guten Handling mit Kamera
( Bei mir die A7R); Une optique d'une tr√®s grande qualit√©.

The lens has been delivered safely in a nice sturdy package. So far I have liked the performance of the product as results have been good.; If Lens hood was provided it would have been far better; I love to capture the best moments of travel and this is the lens that is always on my camera (Nikon D7100) ever since I bought it a year and a half ago.
Attaching a few photos from a single trip to illustrate: the Lake is taken from a moving vehicle at 1/4000s, the Tawang Monastery zoomed in at 140mm, the Rhino at 300mm from the back of an elephant, the Orchids an example of bokeh at 65mm.
I've also put in the last two images taken in low light conditions with the same lens, different trip: the painting of Vajrapani at 1/13s shutter speed and the Chaitya cave at 1/50s shutter speed. All photos hand held.
Easily the best lens to carry for travel.; Though I was initially a little hesitant, I am glad I made this investment and the results are very satisfying with my D 3300. The clarity at full zoom, bokeh and time taken to focus is incredible. The best part has to be that this will all your other lens useless.... phew! & no more of that heavy bag around!; Value for money no more multiple lenses needed during traveling; A very impressive product although not very sharp at 300-mm end. Seller's service was also very impressive.; the lens is good and further review will be done shortly; Great product. Take care of my needs.; A objetiva √© original e, sendo da Nikon, para usar nas c√¢meras da Nikon, n√£o h√° o que acrescentar!; Gran compra,; I am a graphic designer and photographer; I am also a Nikon fanboy. I have used Sony and Canon, but always come back to my trusty Nikon D5300. I had an AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-105 mm but sadly smashed it while on a night shoot. I was looking for a replacement but couldn't find a new one, and when I did, they were extortionately expensive.

I did some research and found this one on Amazon that I could get on 5, 0% interest instalments, which was a no brainer, I really wish Amazon did more items on the 5 easy payment, 0% interest instalments scheme. It is so helpful and is a peace of mind. I have literally, just ordered a 4K monitor that I found on their website too.

The lens is a Nikon 2216 AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-300 mm. But more importantly it has a metal F-Mount, which is a big deal because I have had my plastic one‚Äôs break. So, for me that is a massive bonus!

I bought a new 67mm hood for the lens and already had a good quality CIR-PL filter.

On Friday, I used the lens for the first time on a night shoot for a client in the middle of nowhere with a crew of 50 people and tower lights and the lens was fantastic, the 18-300 zoom was so helpful as the job site was about 650 metres long. I did the majority of photos handheld I took a few on my tripod, but to be honest it was just easier.

The lens is not light along with my camera the whole thing weights about 2.6lbs.

I got some lovely bokeh shots and some nice clean close ups of the crews. There is a bit of noise but with lightroom I have setup a batch reduction on the RAW files.

I have to say this is an excellent official Nikon lens, and for the money it is expensive, but if you are able to do the 0% interest payments. I would highly recommend.; Un bon objectif, le large d√©battement permet de faire du grand angle comme du t√©l√© et donc de ne jamais avoir √† changer d'objectif (√† moins de vouloir vraiment faire du fisheye ou photographier une souris √† 200 m√®tres !), c'est tr√®s pratique. La stabilisation optique est assez efficace aussi, pour de la vid√©o √ßa permet de faire de la cam√©ra √† l'√©paule correcte sans avoir √† utiliser de gimbal. Je conseille donc pour tous ceux qui veulent optimiser leur budget pour leurs premiers investissements en mat√©riel."

I repeat once again, I‚Äôm not a professional, so I don‚Äôt look for expensive super bright lenses at crazy prices, photographing based on the principle: it‚Äôs not the equipment that shoots, but the photographer!; Vorweg: Ich bin Hobbyfotograf und verdiene mit der Fotografie kein Geld. Um meine Objektivfamilie zu erweitern war ich auf der Suche nach einem Objektiv f√ºr meine Sony Alpha 7 III mit Festbrennweite f√ºr Portraitfotografie oder einfach eins f√ºr immer drauf...
Nach einigen Recherchen bin ich beim Sony 85 mm gelandet und habe es nicht bereut!
Nach ersten Tests bin ich sehr positiv √ºberrascht was da an Bildqualit√§t kommt :-)
Ich kann das Objektiv uneingeschr√§nkt empfehlen.
Fazit:
sehr schneller und vor allem treffsicherer lautloser Autofokus
hervorragende Bildqualit√§t und tolles Bukett
Preis mit knapp 450 Euro auch f√ºr Hobbyfotografen erschwinglich
Haptik und Qualit√§t Top; Good for portrait; Ho deciso di prendere quest‚Äôottica perch√® si tratta di una lente full frame in budget, essedo uno studente non posso di certo permettermi ottiche g master che costano minimo 1000 euro. L ho provato con la mia A7II per sostituire la lente kit con cui ho imparato tanto. Il suo punto di forza √® sicuramente lo sfocato pazzesco che riesce a separare in modo molto naturale il soggetto dallo sfondo. Con il diaframma aperto a F 1.8 la messa a fuoco √® buona e silenziosissima, ma bisogna fare attenzione a dove si mette a fuoco perch√® si rischia di sfocare facilmente porzione di capelli o orecchie nei ritratti, inoltre il soggetto deve stare almeno a 80/90 cm da voi sen√≤ non riesce a mettere a fuoco, normale che sia cos√¨, comunque √® un medio tele. Riguardo alla distorsione prospettica mi sembra che sia assente o veramente minima. La nitidezza e la porzione di area messa a fuoco aumenta con un diaframma pi√π chiuso ma sacrificate il bokeh. Ovviamente √® super luminoso, quindi ottimo per fare anche un po di foto street di sera/notte. Livello di qualit√† costruttiva top, tutto in metallo ma non super leggero, 380 gr circa con il paraluce, che montato sulla A7II porta il totale a quasi un 1 kg in mano, setup sempre pi√π leggero di una reflex almeno. Come focale 85 mm non √® male per un bel po di generi fotografici (mi sono trovato molto bene in ritratto, street e macro) e il fatto che sia un focale fissa regala un‚Äôottima nitidezza dell‚Äôimmagine e luminosit√†, di gran lunga migliore di lenti kit o tuttofare medio economici. Preso leggermente in sconto, lo consiglio sicuramente per chi non vuole spendere troppo per le lenti g master. Piccola nota: attivate la stabilizzazione del corpo macchina perch√® questa lente non √® stabilizzata e con tempi di otturazione troppo lunghi si rischia il micro mosso o il mosso. Nel mio caso la stabilizzazione della A7II fa il suo dovere stabilizzando bene le foto scattate con quest‚Äôobiettivo."

It is also perfect for portrait and other general purposes . This lens also produces nice bokeh. The picture quality and bokeh quality are very good. Overall, this is a very versatile lens. Being a prime lens (this 35mm lens), you will need to move your feet a lot to compose your picture.The big plus with this lens over the older 35mm lens is the AF-S feature which is auto focus system that is internal to the lens, very fast and very silent. This lens will please a lot of people who currently own D40, D40x, D60, D3000, D3100, D3200, D5000, D5100, D5200 and D7000, as they now can benefit from the autofocus. Another big win is the manual override on autofocus mode (M/A mode), which will allow us to change the focus without having to change the mode to manual mode

Here are the summary of pros and cons for this Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S lens:

Pros:
1. AF-S AF-S AF-S (very fast focus, internal focus, and very silent)
2. M/A mode (manual focus override available on autofocus mode)
3. Very fast lens (f/1.8)
4. Very sharp pictures
5. Great for sport/action photography (though you might need more zoom)
6. Great for indoor and low light situation
7. Great for portrait
8. Bokeh is almost as good as many expensive Nikon tele-lens
9. Perfect for low light with no-flash event. However, also check out the following lens for low light photography: 17-35mm f/2.8, 24-70 f/2.8, 17-55mm f/2.8, 28-70mm f/2.8 or the the 50mm nikon prime lenses.
9. Great focal length (35mm). About 50mm equivalent which is a normal lens (If you need more zoom, you can get the Nikon 50mm or 85mm prime lens or 70-200mm f/2.8 VR lens).
10.Very fast and very silent focus.

Cons:
1. Being prime lens, you need to move your feet a lot to adjust/compose
3. No VR. As VR will be useful for taking handheld shots on low light; Camera Body - D5100

Having used this lens as my only lens for over 2 years, I can say that this is the best f/1.8 lens you can get for general street photography. I didn't take the kit lens 18-55mm with my Nikon D5100. Instead I picked this one.

The lens build is decent and it comes with a 52mm filter groove. It also contains a lens hood to take care of sun flares. I keep a Hoya UV filter attached to the lens all the time to protect the glass of the lens. It is an AF-S lens which means it comes with a AF motor built in and will auto focus on the Nikon D3xxx, D5xxxx series cameras. If you own a D7xxx series camera, a D90 or an FX camera, you might look for the cheaper 35mm f/1.8D lens that doesn't have a built in auto focus motor.

Now coming to the picture quality, it's nothing short of amazing. With the large f/1.8 aperture, you can capture photos in low light even though the AF tends to struggle a bit under very low lighting conditions (you can fine tune that with Manual Focus Override). It produces decent bokeh at f/1.8 and is very sharp at around f/4. The lens comes with a switch to toggle between M/A (Auto Focus with Manual override) and Manual Focus.

If you're confused between the 35mm f/1.8 and the 50mm f/1.8 and own a DX camera body (the models mentioned above), I would suggest you go for the 35mm which would give you a decent Field of View for general use and can be a great carry-around lens. With the 50mm, you can take better portraits but for general usage and group shots, you will have to step back quite far. If you're a portrait shooter, then blindly go for the 85mm f/1.8.

Attached are some sample images taken with this 35mm f/1.8 lens with Nikon D5100; I bought this product from a seller called Daffodils Electronics for Rs.8750. Good packaging and safely sent in around 8 days. Though the product was dispatched the same day it took 8 days to receive because it was sent by India post and I am really not sure as in how much care goes in handling these delicate items. One star minus for this.

Overall I got the product in good condition within a sealed box packaged nicely and yes with Nikon warranty. The lens has the tag made in China and box says Tokyo so not sure from where it's manufactured or what are the technicalities. I have 18-140 which is made in Thailand.

Coming to the product usage: I found it excellent in terms of bokeh and shots in low light conditions. Pictures are crispier though not a huge difference when compared to my default 18-140mm on d5300. But I will have to test this in various other scenarios. I found the images a little out of focus in few shots so you need to be careful while focusing or choosing right shutter speed to avoid shake and focus at the right area. Incase you have 18-140 which is a very good multi purpose lens I would suggest to hold on and only spend if you got the money or you are a PRO. Rest all assured as excellent.; Very cool and useful lens for the daily life photography. Awesome performance. It becomes a must lens for my Nikon D3500. There are manual and autofocus modes. I prefer to use manual focus which is working perfectly. Happy for purchasing it.üòé; deze lens werkt niet op de camera; I've had this lens for just about a month and I couldn't be happier with it! The Nikon AF-S DX NIKKOR 35mm f/1.8G gives you a lot of quality for a little bit of money. I'm shooting with a Nikon D3500 DSLR and I have to say this lens is quite a step up from the kit lenses that came with my camera.

The Nikon AF-S DX NIKKOR 35mm f/1.8G Len has great clarity and the auto focus works very well. It's relatively fast to focus and shoot with. The manual focus works well and the focus ring moves smoothly. It's versatile close-up and far away, but remember, this is a prime lens so there is no zoom. You have to do any zooming with your feet by moving to position your framing and your shot.

This lens works well in low-light situations with the ability to open the aperture up to F1.8G. It's easy to control the depth of field and creates a nice bokeh (blurred) background for professional looking photos. An example of blurred colored lights is attached.

This lens is great for portrait or product photography and it's very good for landscapes too. The other attached photos examples have only a minimum of post-processing, mostly to adjust exposure and highlights, but they are a good example of the quality this lens offers for its price point. The lens is small and light and it's become my ""go-to"" whenever I'm shooting pictures. It won't weigh you down carrying it for a day of shooting.

Remember, depending on your camera, this lens may not shoot as a true 35mm - on my camera's cropped sensor, it shoots the equivalent of 50.2mm. This works well for me for the various types of shooting I like to do. I really can't give a list of pros and cons since I have no experience with another similar lens (it's my 1st prime lens), but I will say that so far, all I've seen are ""pros"". As an amateur photographer, it's a nice step up from kit lenses.

I don't hesitate to suggest this lens and I would purchase another. Thanks for reading my review and I hope it help you to decide on the lens that you really think will work for you.; Todo depende de tu estilo de fotograf√≠a, pero este lente de 35 mm es muy vers√°til y un paso adelante del lente Kit que vienen las c√°maras cuando las compras. Es un angular fijo o prime, lo que significa que no tiene zoom (algo que para algunos puede no gustar) pero su luminosidad (obturaci√≥n) de 1,8 y calidad de imagen, lo hacen una estrella al precio que tiene. Adem√°s te obliga a preparar mejor el encuadre y moverte, algo que siempre beneficia al resultado, pero como dije es tema de estilos. Con √©l puedes tomar fotos en bajas condiciones de luz sin subir el ISO o velocidad, en retratos te genera un buen ‚ÄúBokeh‚Äù (no al estilo de un tel√©fono, pero muy bueno). Es DX (Aunque sirve tambi√©n para FX) por lo que en c√°maras De sensor recortado no te hace el cambio de distancia focal que es 35 mm. para c√°maras de la serie DX (ej. 3500, 5600, 7200, D500) Para los que toman v√≠deo su enfoque es r√°pido y silencioso una gran ventaja. El enfoque puede ser autom√°tico y manual, un detalle importantee, si es que quieres enfoque manual solo con tocar la rosca el lente reconoce que quieres hacer t√∫ el ajuste y se desconecta autom√°ticamente para dejarte trabajar sin quitar el ojo del viewfinder. Viene con tapas en los 2 extremos y una bolsa tipo gamuza para protegerlo. Te sirve para street photography, retrato, vacaciones y foto de eventos si es que no te importa acercarte a la gente. No lo recomiendo para deportes o naturaleza.

Temas a recordar:
1.- No es un lente zoom solo es de 35 mm.
2.- Si quieres comprarle accesorios o filtros (como polarizador o ND) , la medida del lente es 52 mm.
3.- Para video su luminosidad y enfoque silencioso son ideales.
4.- ¬°Excelente calidad de imagen!; A compra foi √≥tima. A lente √© sensacional! Como tudo o que a Nikon faz. A rela√ß√£o com o vendedor foi perfeita. Entrega e seguran√ßa nota 10.; I‚Äôm pretty new to photography but felt it was time to upgrade from my kit (18-55mm) lens. I bought this as it was a) a cheap prime lens and b) I had heard it was good for general photography and portraits. I think it‚Äôs fantastic and excellent value for money and has really helped me develop as a photographer. It‚Äôs excellent for general photography and especially portraits. I love using it for street photography in particular. The large aperture of this lens really allows for a great control over depth of field and is also really useful in low light or indoor conditions. I have found this especially useful in practicing and improving my photographic skills. It produced really high quality photos and I‚Äôm really happy with it. Highly recommend.

The lens also comes with a hood, cap (obviously) and storage pouch. The hoods great when shooting outside and can be neatly stowed in reverse down the body of the lens when not in use which is great for saving space and not having loose things lying about. The pouch is great for storage and whilst it won‚Äôt help in the case of knocks and bumps is great for a little light protection and protection from the elements and things like dust. The lens also has a great autofocus that's both accurate and swift which is really really useful when photographing. It won't go super close to the lens, you'll need a specialised macro for that, but does a really great job for all other parts.

The lens is great, in my opinion, as a bit of a general lens to keep on the camera. It‚Äôs useable in a wide variety of situations and is quite versatile. It‚Äôs also incredibly light weight and compact meaning you will barely even notice it‚Äôs there. Great for when you‚Äôre just carrying your camera around (such as on holiday) or exploring.

As this is so cheap and also high quality i would really recommend this to beginners looking to up there game and learn a bit more and improve. I certainly have. The wide aperture really helps in developing your understanding of the exposure triangle and to play about a bit to really learn by doing. I‚Äôm still improving and have a long way to go but this is still proving valuable some time on and I believe I‚Äôll be using it for a long time yet.

Overall: 5 stars! Would award 6 if I could. Absolutely excellent bit of kit that comes at a great price.

I Own sony 85 mm and sigma 24-70. I am not satisfied with sigma. Sony 85mm gives much more better result than Sigma 24-70. Having said that I dont have any experience with sigma prime lenses.; I am an amateur photographer who takes a lot of portraits for friends and family and does an occasional paid shoot. I currently am building my lens collection. To be honest, when I want top quality portraits I usually go with my 85 mm prime lens.

However, when I am out and about with my family and want to capture good candid shots, or am taking photos for my school (I am a teacher by profession), I use this lens. The photo quality is very sharp, the color is great. I am very happy with the functionality of this zoom lens. I would not hesitate recommending this lens for those who are on a bit of a budget over the competition. My experience with this lens has made seriously consider the Sigma 70-200 mm 2.8 Sport as a budget alternative to the Sony's version II of the same lens.; Llevo unos meses con este lente y se convirti√≥ en mi lente principal.

La calidad del lente es excelente, tiene muy buena nitidez, el desenfoque que realiza se mira excelente, yo lo uso en mi sony alpha 6000. Solo lo he usado para fotograf√≠a, para video solo unas peque√±as pruebas y se mira muy bien tambien

El √∫nico inconveniente es que si es muy pesado, es cuesti√≥n de acostumbrarse, si el peso no es un problema para lo que ofrece, es un excelente lente

La aberraci√≥n crom√°tica si est√° presente pero no es nada exagerado, s√≥lo en apertura amplias y aun as√≠ no son problema; TL;DR:
The Sigma 24-70mm lens offers exceptional performance and versatility for Sony E-mount cameras. With its fast aperture, sharp image quality, and solid build, it is a reliable choice for professional photographers and enthusiasts. When compared to the Sony G Master 24-70mm and Tamron 28-75mm lenses, the Sigma provides excellent value for its optical performance and build quality.

Review:

The Sigma 24-70mm lens is highly regarded for its exceptional performance and versatility on Sony E-mount cameras. It is designed to deliver outstanding results across a wide range of photography genres and is a popular choice among professional photographers and enthusiasts.

One of the standout advantages of the Sigma 24-70mm lens is its fast aperture, providing a constant F2.8 throughout the zoom range.

When compared to the Sony G Master 24-70mm lens, the Sigma 24-70mm lens provides similar optical performance at a more affordable price point. While the Sony G Master lens may have some additional features and a more established brand reputation, the Sigma lens offers excellent value for its optical quality and build.

Compared to the Tamron 28-75mm lens, the Sigma 24-70mm lens offers a wider zoom range and a faster constant aperture. This makes it more versatile in capturing a range of subjects and provides better low-light performance. However, the Tamron lens may be more compact and lightweight, making it a more portable option for certain shooting scenarios.

In summary, the Sigma 24-70mm lens offers exceptional performance and versatility for Sony E-mount cameras. Its fast aperture, sharp image quality, and solid build make it a reliable choice for professional photographers and enthusiasts.

Pros:
1. Great image quality and sharpness
2. No noticeable chromatic aberration and fringing. This is where it beats lenses from other competitors. I had used Nikon 50mm lens earlier and it had loads of purple, green,etc. fringing very difficult to correct in post.
3. Large and smooth mf ring. Manual focussing experience is great with this lens. Autofocus is fast.
4. Lightweight and small.

Cons I really can't think of any. But I miss the aperture ring because I have got used to it on other lenses. Mounting this lens changes the ergonomics every time because of this.; Very good lens but plastic body
Budget lens very useful lens; It's focus is sharp and fast , focusing far and near object is smooth and quick; Good for portraits and it is also fast.; It's sharp, lightweight and cheaper that XF lens. Must have lense; Super sharp and flexible. A bargain at this price. Its small size helps in public.; I think this is a very cheap lens and does not give a very good picture. Fuji made it low quality to sell it cheap. The picture quality is not what you like most of the time. Autofocus works ok, but you may not like it. But it is very lightweight so the overall carry weight is less and that makes an excellent travel kit; Ho aspettato un po' prima di scrivere questa valutazione. Avevo letto tantissime recensioni su quest'ottica, ma continuavo a restare scettico, poi mi sono deciso. Mai scelta fu gi√π vincente. Con un prezzo cos√¨ non troverete di meglio. Qualit√† ottica degna di Fuji, leggerissimo, messa a fuoco soddisfacente (anche in condizioni difficili). L'ho montato e non l'ho pi√π tolto per almeno un mese.! Mi ha regalato grandi scatti al mio piccolo di 9 mesi :)
A mio avviso l'attacco di plastica √® sufficientemente solido e non d√† alcun problema se non ne si fa un uso professionale (monta-smonta pi√π volte alla settimana).
Se siete dei professionisti o semplicemente avete altri budget puntate al nuovo 33mm f1.4. Altrimenti, se volete un 35mm pi√π che ottimo in corredo, non abbiate timori - questo piccolino √® una bomba.; Un objetivo muy n√≠tido, incluso desde f2. A f3.2 los detalles en la piel son incre√≠bles, esta al nivel del 50mm f1.8 de Nikon, que tambi√©n tuve en su d√≠a. El enfoque es muy r√°pido, mas que cualquier otro objetivo que haya probado de Fujifilm excepto el XF 23mm f2. El bokeh, sin embargo, sin ser malo es algo peor de lo que esperaba.

La construcci√≥n es buena pese a ser de pl√°stico, encaja sin problemas y al ser tan ligero como compa√±ero de una c√°mara peque√±a como la Fujifilm X-T30 es fant√°stico. No echo de menos el aro de diafragmas porque siempre uso diales. Eso si, como punto negativo no trae parasol ninguno, aunque le sirven perfectamente tanto el del XF 23mm f2 como el del XF 35mm f2.

En resumen, por el precio que tiene es una compra imprescindible para un fujista.; Als Fotograf bin ich immer auf der Suche nach neuen Objektiven, die meine Kreativit√§t verbessern und meine F√§higkeiten erweitern k√∂nnen. Ich habe mich f√ºr das FUJIFILM XC35mmF2 Objektiv entschieden und ich bin sehr zufrieden mit meinem Kauf.

Die Bildqualit√§t, die ich mit diesem Objektiv erzielen kann, ist hervorragend. Die Bilder sind scharf und haben eine sch√∂ne Farbgebung. Die F2-Blende erm√∂glicht es mir, auch bei schlechten Lichtverh√§ltnissen gute Bilder zu machen, ohne zu viel Rauschen zu erzeugen.

Die Gr√∂√üe und das Gewicht des Objektivs sind ebenfalls hervorragend. Es ist sehr leicht und handlich und passt perfekt zu meiner Kamera. Das macht es zu einem gro√üartigen Reiseobjektiv, das ich immer dabei haben kann.

Die manuelle Fokussierung ist auch sehr pr√§zise und macht es leicht, die gew√ºnschte Sch√§rfeebene zu erreichen. Die Autofokussierung ist auch schnell und pr√§zise.

Ich habe dieses Objektiv f√ºr Landschaften, Portr√§ts und Stra√üenfotografie verwendet und es hat sich in jeder Situation bew√§hrt. Die Verarbeitung ist ebenfalls hervorragend, wie man es von FUJIFILM-Produkten gewohnt ist.

Insgesamt bin ich sehr zufrieden mit dem FUJIFILM XC35mmF2 Objektiv. Es hat meine Erwartungen √ºbertroffen und ist zu einem wichtigen Teil meiner Kameraausr√ºstung geworden. Ich w√ºrde es jedem empfehlen, der nach einem vielseitigen und hochwertigen Objektiv sucht, das zu einem erschwinglichen Preis angeboten wird.; While this is not a general-use lens, it won't be your catch-all like the 18-55mm zoom or the 27mm prime, it's really great at its price. It's something you swap to when you spot the right target. I'm finding it best for intimate candid portraits amongst friends, getting wonderful mid-conversation faces without being too invasive. I've never tried the XF version this is based on, but the lack of aperture ring doesn't bother me, and the plastic build quality actually makes it super light which I appreciate a lot from this lens. While it's a focal length covered by my zoom, I just prefer the pictures that come out of it when shooting at 35mm.

This is my first prime lens with Fuji and I do think it marks a great start, as it's getting me to think about the advantages of primes and teaching me to identify the situations these lenses thrive in and how to capitalise on those opportunities.; "

My basic aim to buy this lens was portrait photography with bokeh effect. As I am skin doctor I need to photograph many skin lesions for academic purpose. This lens has served my purpose with good clarity. Light weight easily fits on most of the mobiles and easy to carry with immediate fitting on mobile lens. You save time especially for candid shot. The packing of the lens is too good with complete safety for your lens; If it is for a photo you can take it. but as a videographer I realised when in use or in movement the lens is not perfectly fit. It doesn't fall but it shakes. so does the focus of the video. It may fall too if your phone has experienced a sudden jerk. I expected it to be fit as it were a part of the phone. But overall the quality is better than expected.; I have been looking to buy a lens for my iPhone and after a bit of research and stuff I decided on the 60mm telephoto lens. Gotta say, i was really impressed with the packaging to start with.Even the quality of Lens body, which is made of Aluminium and the bag in which it comes. Having used the lens on various occasions and conditions , I have to say im really impressed and would recommend people to go for it.; Product quality is amazing however trying to get a perfect picture isn't all that great. Zoom quality, lens quality is superb but theres is alot of distortion in the lens which in some or many photographs we dont need besides just zoom.
How much will you crop and edit?; I bought it for Iphone 11 and I didnt see much difference with lens. see my pics I uploaded one photo with lens and one is without lens. and the other pic without lens and zoomed capture one. For me it is not worth for money but product quality is good. Best for beginners who is interested in photography. We can also use it for front camera see the selfie pics with lens and without lens"

Significantly improves the picture quality over the entry level Kit lens. Auto Focus is a bit slow sometimes, and the build quality isn't too great, but considering the price, these are non issues. Good for portrait photography and is very versatile for a lot of situations. I purchased for 6k. Could be had for 5.5k during sales; Autofocus isn‚Äôt up to mark; I dont know how in the world this product is being sold. And I can't explain any of the positive reviews here. Absolutey impossible to take photos as the autofocus keeps struggling. Even if the object manages to stay still for the shot its no guarantee that the image will be sharp. I even tried it with a professional cameraman. Even he could not manage to take any good pics with his high end camera setup. And when i tried his canon 50 mm it worked like a charm. I have no idea how people have given good reviews for this as I'm not a beginner at photography. Disappointed.; The lense is superb!! Actually it'll give you a Bokeh effect to your image.
Worth buying!; Works overall fine, but not well build.
you havw to handle with care
also motor sound is loud.
autofocus is ok (not very good)
but compared to its price overall good product.

If you are tight on budget, u can try this. But if you can spend a bit more, don't go for this; Its a good prime lens..Overall Picture quality is good..A little bit slow in Focus But You can Easy Manage ..Overall all Good..It bought this at 7600‚Çπ; I am no expert photographer, matter of fact I‚Äôve only taken a dozen of photos with any camera other than my phone! I watched videos and read tons of articles on photographing people when I eventually came to the conclusion that the 50mm was pretty much a staple lens for this. I was hesitant because there are so many others that are a lot more pricey however this one is great! The pictures are of my son and I feel like they turned out amazing for a newbie like myself! It‚Äôs well worth the money for the clarity and quality of the photo!; Muy buen lente, lleg√≥ en perfectas condiciones y obvio nuevo en su cajita; Great cheap alternative. Works perfectly in my canon 60d; Very good for close up shots and portraits; This is an excellent option for the newbie and for the hobbyists. Its a great nifty fifty prime for the price. The foreground focus is clean, while the background gives a nice faded bokeh. Its perfect for headshots and bust shots. I haven't used it for street or even architecture, yet.
There's a noticeable difference in the quality of the build compared to a OEM Canon lens. Yet, it's about the same size, and same functionality. I've had many different Canon and Nikon lenses throughout my time, yet this one is half the price with a better-than-average result.
Totally worth the money spent."

Incredible sharpness, focus speed, and the background separation is very satisfying, too. Only thing missing is the image stabilization, which would've been a welcome feature for those using budget Z-line cameras like the Z50, but I haven't had any major issues yet, especially since I can use higher shutter speeds at wider apertures like f1.8 or even 2.8.; All the reviews about this lens which you find on YouTube are accurate. I was sceptical about those reviews because of how overtly positive they were, but now I know why. Attaching some sample images from this lens- probably the images might get compressed while being uploaded here so don't judge the sharpness via these pics. They were taken using a Z6 (haven't added any sharpness in post). This lens is very sharp, produces the perfect level of contrast and has no chromatic abberation at all !; Super Sharp
Superfast AF
I attached 2 pictures one is originl straight out of camera and the other is cropped.
And of course the colors are brilliant.
Cost wise i don't think it's over priced for the results it gives. For whom this is costly can use the 50mm 1.8g with FTZ adapter. That's also good but this is much more better. If you want to invest in a 50mm don't think much.; This far surpasses any other 50mm from any other brand in existence at this price. The sharpness and the color contrast are on some other level. It smokes the sigma 50mm art and equals Ziess glass worth 4-5 times more.
Don‚Äôt be fooled by the 50 1.8, it‚Äôs as good as a 50mm gets. Simply put, doesn‚Äôt want to come off my z6.; Its one of the best 50mm that money can buy. I know its F/1.8, but you will not be disappointed. If you happen to pair it up with Z7ii or Z9; with appropriate lighting (natural or flash), you are promised to get stunning images. 50mm is my to go for all events, portraits and sometimes even landscape (though < 25mm is suited for that). I have also used it with Z50 and got phenomenal results. I would just buy it for keepsake even given the quality of glass.

Yes, I realize priced much more than the F mount 50mm; but this is special. Would you need f/1.2 ? Well depends on the depth of field and your style. But f/1.8 is the must have IMHO.; This is the best 50mm I have ever used!
Stunning images, beautiful lens; Picture quality awesome sharp image at low light; I like its sharpness, AF, weather seal design, ease of handling. All Z series owners must own a copy of this, from casual photographer to serious wedding shooter with a flexible to tight budget. You will definitely be amazed after seeing the results it produces. It gives VR when with Z5, 6 & 7 due to IBIS, but not with Z50.; I've been a professional photographer for some time and 50mm has always been my favoured focal length. I've had many lenses over the years that were as wide as 1.4 - 1.8 but always new the quality at that aperture range made for poor unuseable images. I am completely blown away by the edge to edge clarity at the widest apertures on this lens. Not only is it tack sharp but is completely free of chromatic aberrations. Absolutely superb. üíØ; Probably the best 50 Ive owned; tack sharp even wide open, silent, quick focus, good build, not too heavy. The falloff wide open is beautiful, and so far zero chromatic aberration, fringing, or anything at all. Its been written in more than a few places, this is the best 50 Nikon has ever made, and compared to my older G its a nice step up; I only wish it was smaller, but with all the elements and mirrorless etc, its still reasonable in size. Given its size, I did end up returning it, and sticking with the 40mm that came with my ZF camera; the 40 isn't nearly as sharp wide open, but stopped down its nearly identical and a much smaller much lighter lens.; I am absolutely blown away by the performance of the Fast 50mm prime lens for Z Mirrorless cameras! The f/1.8 aperture delivers uncanny sharpness and virtually zero distortion, ensuring that every shot is crisp and clear. The new ultra-quiet stepping motor makes focusing silent and seamless, perfect for capturing candid moments without disturbing the scene. The beautiful bokeh and superior low-light performance make this lens a dream to use in any lighting conditions. I'm particularly impressed by the 5-axis dual detect optical VR, which ensures stable and blur-free images, especially when shooting handheld. The compact, lightweight, and slim design of the lens make it a joy to carry around, and the tilting vari-angle LCD display adds to its versatility. Plus, the compatibility with F Mount NIKKOR lenses using the FTZ Mount Adapter extends its usability even further. Overall, I couldn't be happier with this lens, and I highly recommend it to any photographer looking for exceptional performance and versatility.; Es un muy buen lente para las c√°maras Nikon Z. Tiene un autoenfoque instant√°neo, un gran apertura para fotos en poca luz y un maravilloso bokeh. Es ligero y de un tama√±o adecuado.

Totalmente recomendado para usuarios de la serie Nikon Z. Deber√≠an ofrecerlo como un lente kit, como en los tiempos de anta√±o, donde el primer lente de uno era el 50 1.8. Ya me entr√≥ la nostalgia...; Just one of those very rare moments these days where performance beats price. This thing is amazing for what you pay for it. A ""Prime"" lens that relatively doesn't cost your kidney and lung to get it. It may not be ""cheap"" (for you) in price but you are not going to find anything in this price range with comparable specs that outperforms this on a ""Z mount"" today. Don't waste your time and money on trying to get something else to imitate this lens... You've bought an expensive camera - DON'T CHEAP OUT NOW!

Bright, sharp images with natural, well-defined colours, and micro-contrast that you often don't notice in other lenses. Sharpness right across the image corner to corner at wide-open. Bokeh is artistically dreamy and typically Nikon. There's little to no messing about with the images straight out of the camera in your Photo software either. So easy to work with...

You may pay less for other brands but you will ALWAYS find compromises in those when comparing to this lens, right? So why not get the ""standard""?"

Best protection; Bought this for my one plus 11. And let me tell you about my trainwreck of an experience trying to install this. The instructions that come on the cover for installing the lens protector (a qr code scan which will take you to the instructions video) only tells about how to install the screen/display protector of the same brand but not the camera lens cover. So I had to try watch other videos to install. In the box it came with a dry wipe, wet wipe and the tempered lens cover for the camera along with a small paper print which gave the WhatsApp contact details of the seller in case of disappointments and ""insisting"" the customer to review the product after purchase. So I lens cover in itself is poorly designed, the quality is solid and worth the price but the design they have messed it up. The 4 see through part of the tempered cover which is to go on to of the camera are not precision designed and are rather assymetric and do not sit on all lenses correctly. You have to tilt and make adjustments so that each camera can sit perfectly, the black non-see through portion which is supposed to sit inbetween and outer the lenses are pitch black and hiding the hasselblad back which is rather disappointing considering how the default camera lens spaces in oneplus 11 has a silky starry design which is the main showpiece at the back of phone. Anyways after you remove the lens protector from it's sticker, please stick it directly on to the camera, it unfortunately has a notch on the back side of the camera protector leading the users to belive there is one more sticker which you have to remove before sticking the tempered protector to the camera. So ya with that assumption I dug in the notch and peeled of the sticker only to find out that IT WAS THE GLUE!! there were no sticky portions left and the protector could no longer be stuck on the camera. What a waste of time and money! All this could've been solved if the instructional video actually showed how to install the lens protector as well along with display protector or by simply having a instruction leaflet printed in the box instead of the asking for 5 star review leaflet. Very disappointing experience. Now I am lead to believe that the high ratings of this product here (4 stars and plus) is purely for the screen protectors and coming mostly from the users reading the pleasing words in the review leaflet.; The product is very good, packaging is nice fit and finish is really gud , and this camera tampered is perfectly protect your camera, because in one plus 12r I personally feel in camera glass company not give any extra ordinary protection so if you want to protect your camera for miner scratch and other thind pls cover your camera, And talk about fitting so not 100 percentage accurate but 95 percentage is fit , and you consider this product difinetly.; Excellent and good quality product. Worth it. I highly recommend. Fits perfectly and looks grand.
Not sure of the adhesive will hold well. Will see on that. Nut looks it will. Thank you Amazon.; The lens protector quality is good, it does not affect your camera quality, the photos will be crystal clear. It will protect your camera from dust and scratches, The Cutouts are also precisely made.

The image quality this lens delivers is truly remarkable. The sharpness and clarity of the images it produces is fantastic, with stunning bokeh effects in my portraits. The low light performance is also great, especially for outdoor nigh-time street photography.
I've tested this lens in various environments, including rain and wet conditions, and it has consistently performed without any issues. Its build quality and weather sealing makes it reliable and durable.
I've attached a few sample images to this review to demonstrate its capabilities. You can see more of these images on my Instagram (i_aakashahuja).
Cheers!; Must buy lens for Sony apsc e-mount.
Price-wise- Very reasonable in comparison to native lens.
Performance- auto focus response is very fast, Bokeh is mind blowing.
Ergonomics- well built, strong construction and balances very well against the camera.
Low light performance- Very very capable low light capability.
Colorado reproduction- Colours look warm and rich. Tones are beautiful, the jpeg images are itself good enough and won't have to bother with raw images.
Valve for money- I purchased the lens at 26K, it's competition Sony 50mm 1.8 native lens is just a couple of thousand cheaper. Comparing the two, the sharpness of sigma is remarkable. The Sony lens however has optical stabilization so it may perform better on A6300, A6000 at low shutter speed. If you own a A6500, undoubtedly one should buy the sigma.
Cons- no in body stabilization so best suited for A6500.; Ok I'll start with the disclaimer that I don't have the Sony 50 mm 1.8 so no comparisons here.

Now coming to this lens. If you're into portrait photography or simply love shots with a shallow depth of field and a lively bokeh, you'll love this lens !! Especially at this price. Sure the Sony 50 mm 1.8 is cheaper, but this goes down to 1.4, which while good will also make your work harder as the depth of field goes down to insane levels. As with most lenses, it's a good idea to shoot a stop or two above the minimum aperture value. With this lens, 1.8 or 2.0 would be a good point. 56 mm on a Sony APSC corresponds 84 mm.. which is bang in prime portrait focal length.

Now coming to what must be the top of many people's mind, the bokeh. Well, the good news is that it's AWESOME ! Nice n creamy, to use the photography lingo.

The negative...well..only one in my personal experience is that the autofocus could be a bit better and bit faster. I've seen that the autocus, especially Eye AF, is activated much faster and further away in a native Sony Lens than on this lens. Just a feeling I got. I did not do any scientific test on this. Also, some motor noise is captured if you're shooting video with this lens in a quiet environment.

But overall an amazing lens at this price. Thumbs Up !!; A perfect prime lens at satisfying price ! Using it for two months now and I don‚Äôt see much drawback to this lens except for the frame size because it‚Äôs 56mm. If you‚Äôre up for good smooth buttery bokeh, aperture and sharp quality, make sure you add this in your alpha lens collection.; Everything is really good, but I can't get any bad photo with this lens. And I am a beginner. Trust me this is the one everyone should have. I have Sony a6400. Even recording feels like top notch.; EDIT (11-Apr-2021): Added some more sample shots

I just got this yesterday so I haven't used the lens much and can't comment on every aspect of it but I've attached 2 photos of a table fan along with 100% zoom/crop of certain regions from those photos.

As you can see, this lens is tack sharp, even at the widest aperture of F1.4. At F2.0, the image looks the sharpest to me but I haven't shot many photos to be able to judge this. In my sample shots, you can see every little speck of dust and tiny little cloth fibers as well. These are pretty much invisible to the naked eye unless you look really close at the thing you're shooting.

The images have some barrel distortion but I could hardly notice the difference even after correcting the distortion in Lightroom, except on some images where I took pictures of geometric objects. Be sure to capture RAW or RAW+JPEG with this lens because the lens profile is embedded into the RAW files so you can correct lens distortion and chromatic aberrations with two clicks in Lightroom using the embedded profile. This is not available if you shoot only JPEGs. Speaking of chromatic aberrations, I noticed some purple fringing on the edges of object outlines on a couple of photos that I took with flash enabled. It's not too bad and Lightroom can correct it if you shoot RAW but honestly, I think the fringing just makes since images look better but that's subjective.

Video autofocus is alright. Good even, but definitely not like a native Sony lens. I think my 16-50mm kit lens does better autofocus. It worked fine for me most of the times but sometimes it'll just take way too long to focus.

One minor downside (for me) is that the focus ring is very smooth and because of that, while screwing the lens onto the lens mount, it'd slip and I'd have to hold the non movable parts of the lens to screw it on. It's a minor gripe and I'm sure it'll get easier the more times I do this.

Another downside is that it doesn't have OSS but you knew that already. If you have steady hands, you're good. If not, just get a gimbal or a tripod. DJI Ronin SC should have gotten cheaper now. I don't have steady hands but I was still able to take sharp photos most of the time, even while focusing manually.

I'm using this with a Sony A6400 and I own the Sigma 16mm F1.4 as well. They're both great lenses and the 16mm even got a firmware update that makes manually focusing a whole lot easier.

I might update my review after I've used the lens more but don't count on it.

Cheers!
20/10 would recommend; My first time buying a big ticket item from a third party seller and i wasn‚Äôt disappointed . Great deal, lens is perfect. Super sharp and preforming admirably on our vacation. Thank you!; Un lente simplemente incre√≠ble!. Despu√©s de probar numerosas opciones, finalmente encontr√© mi favorito en t√©rminos de distancia focal: este lente es perfecto para m√≠.

Una de las principales razones por las que este lente se ha ganado mi admiraci√≥n es su calidad de construcci√≥n. Es robusto y duradero, lo que me brinda confianza al utilizarlo en diferentes situaciones. Adem√°s, su dise√±o elegante y ergon√≥mico lo hace muy f√°cil de manejar, lo cual es una caracter√≠stica importante para m√≠ cuando estoy trabajando largas horas con mi c√°mara.

Sin embargo, lo m√°s impresionante de este lente es su nitidez. No importa la situaci√≥n, las im√°genes que capturo son simplemente maravillosas. Los detalles son n√≠tidos y la claridad es excepcional. Es un placer ver c√≥mo este lente logra plasmar los colores y los contrastes de una manera tan precisa y realista.

Adem√°s, el punto dulce de este lente est√° entre f4 y f11, lo que significa que obtendr√© los mejores resultados en esa gama de aperturas. Los resultados obtenidos a estas configuraciones son impresionantes, con una incre√≠ble profundidad de campo y una reproducci√≥n de la luz sorprendentemente v√≠vida.

Por √∫ltimo, pero no menos importante, este lente se complementa perfectamente con mi c√°mara Sony ZV-E10. La relaci√≥n entre ambos es simplemente genial. La combinaci√≥n de la calidad de imagen de este lente y la versatilidad de mi c√°mara me permite capturar momentos incre√≠bles y crear contenido de alta calidad.

En general, recomiendo encarecidamente este lente de c√°mara. Su distancia focal, calidad de construcci√≥n y nitidez excepcionales lo convierten en una elecci√≥n perfecta para aquellos que buscan capturar im√°genes impactantes. Si est√°s buscando llevar tus habilidades fotogr√°ficas al siguiente nivel, definitivamente debes considerar este lente.; Great lens for portrait photography. Fast autofocus good build quality.If you are looking for videos better to go with the Sigma 30 1.4 lens.; Everytime i take a photo - it‚Äôs fantastic. I do not regret my purchase.; Avevo letto diverse recensioni positive prima dell'acquisto e sono state confermate dalla prova sul campo.
Lente molto nitida a partire dal centro ai valori di aperture pi√π grandi che consentono un buon effetto bokeh anche restando nel campo dei sensori a formato ridotto.
La focale si presta bene al ritratto e se si vuole sfruttare l'ottima risolvenza basta chiudere un pochino il diaframma.
Non ho avuto particolari problemi scattando in controluce (flare o altre aberrazioni) ma in situazioni di forte contrasto e ad aperture vicine al valore massimo c'√® un leggero calo di incisivit√†, nulla comunque di preoccupante anzi meglio di molte altre lenti...qui si vede che il progetto √® relativamente moderno.
Autofocus veloce e silenzioso ma non da rimanere stupefatto, infatti le lenti Sony restano ancora imbattute in questo aspetto.
Dimensioni compatte che si sposano bene con corpi sony della serie a6xxx (io la uso su a6000), non ha pulsanti o switch AF/MF ma per me non rappresenta un punto a sfavore.
Prezzo allineato alla qualit√† generale della lente e delle propriet√† ottiche che consentono di sfruttare al massimo i nostri sensori."

BUT I LOVE this lens. This is my first manual lens and I am having a ton of fun playing around with it.
I attached a picture I took with it. If you know what you are doing you can take beautiful images.; Do you want to learn photography? Do you think using modern AF lenses are too easy? Do you want that vintage feeling while using your camera? Do you want bragging rights of owning a large aperture lens without selling your kidney? Do you adore small lenses?

If the answer for all of the above is Yes, then go for this lens. But be aware, you will probably need to throw away 50% of your pictures because they might not be in focus. Also due to its small size, the image quality is not as good as it should be even if you focus perfectly since they have made compromises in design.; I don't think that a lens company makes a this type of stupid lens ever; My first lens after the kit lens. Even though this lens has many ""defects"" as mentioned by other reviewers, it surely gives you a unique look, often making your footages standout from other lenses.
I did order the de-clicked aperture version but they sent me the clicked one (mk II), not sure why, but I'm fine either way.

The build quality is fantastic, the body is completely made of metal, and the focus and aperture rings are quite easy to use.

Getting an f/1.2 lens at this price surely comes at the expense of compromising in other areas, but hey, if you can master this manual lens, then you can master any other automatic high-quality lens in future!; I own Sony a6400 & i was looking to buy 36mm Lens but i didnt have budget for sigma so I went with this manual lens. my primary work is to shoot videos for my youtube channel (The Indian Budget Gamer)
and this lens serves me well.

here you are getting 35mm focal lenth + F1.2 aparture which is very very nice specially for videos. you can achive very good bokeh + supperb low light performance with this lens.
Sharpness is perfect in center but there is little distortion on the corner if you use this lens at f1.2 which can be fixed on post processing or by increase aparture value

overall best for money :) if manual focus is not an issue for you. you can go with this lens ! it wont disappoint you; The lens lacks autofocus hence reducing price. Autofocus is again not a point of concern for professionals; Nice size. Focus and aperture rings are good. Only downside it is so small that there is barely any room to grab it from when you need to twist it on and off the camera."

1. After testing these Superno lens, I found clarity according to its capacity. The display of camera screen turn round shape so you have to zoom your camera lens to get rectangle shape.

2. They say the product is made of metal so it is heavy in weight.

3. The clip is so hard that my mobile screen guard is broken.

4. Most importantly, when I raised this matter with the seller, Mr. Sagar Garg, he first responded positively to bear the loss but later he twisted his words.

A company which wishes to grow will never lose the trust of a customer.

I am expressing my sorry to all customers who might have read my previous review which turned incorrect.

Of course this is a bad experience for me from which I learnt something to be aware in future.; Not good. They have just fitted glass in the name of lens; nice product; Since I checked so many lenses but found this one best in budget price. Quality is best Macro lens is very powerfull.; Dislike; It was the worst purchase ever don't buy . Save your delivery charges by not buying itüòÇ; As they have mentioned in description, it is wide angle macro lense. For those who need wide angle shorts you can buy this product.

Nice product üëå; I like it"

Getting used to it
It‚Äôs satisfying my requirements; I was looking to replace my 12 year old cannon 550D. I have been cannon shooter past 20years and it was tough to ditch canon. I developed interest in bird photography past 2 years and was looking for a fast autofocus camera with high ISO.After lotnof research found D7500 perfectly fits into my requirement. It's been over a week and my experience sonfar has been great, low light high ISO performance is great and autofocus is sharp and accurate. I recommend this camera who is looking for an upgrade from a beginner DSLR.; Picture quality is very good, I have done model shoot on the day when it arrives to me and I'm totally satisfied with the camera.; Everything that is legendary ends up being Nikon. 4k video, 20 mp stills, affordable price, very little left to desire. Expected the arrived package to be In better wrapping for an item this expensive.; Damage and diftive; HIGHLY RECOMMENDED; After 40 years as a Pentax user I finally had to give up after two K70 cameras failed due to bad AF solenoids. Have used Nikon binoculars for many years so I migrated to Nikon and chose the D7500 with an 18-140mm lens. Still getting used to the camera, it has a different ‚Äòfeel‚Äô after the Pentax, but I‚Äôm impressed with the picture quality. The lens is certainly heavier than I‚Äôve been used to, but so far the auto focus has worked flawlessly, resulting in a sharpness to the pictures that has been difficult to capture in the past. Despite taking photos and videos for over 60 years, the myriad of settings is intimidating, but the ‚Äòpoint and shoot‚Äô option will probably suffice in most instances.; Produto original de √≥tima y, recomendo; Super appareil photo semi-professionnel.
Un bon d√©but pr les profils interm√©diaires qui souhaitent faire un peu plus de photos autrement qu'en mode automatique.; Girlfriend is more than happy to have a nice camera in her hands.

The only downside is that its 97% plastic made and the manual focus ring is not as smooth

ITS A MUST HAVE; Non voglio essere eccessivamente severo nella mia recensione perch√© resta un obiettivo veramente economico ma la qualit√† costruttiva √® veramente bassa e l‚Äôauto focus fatica molto in condizioni di luce mancante o eccessiva, arrivando persino al crash in un‚Äôoccasione. La lente non sarebbe nemmeno pessima sebbene non abbia una grandissima nitidezza, rovinata per√≤ da importanti aberrazioni cromatiche, il bokeh invece √® molto piacevole. Consiglio se non si hanno grandissime pretese e se si ha l‚Äôoccasione di usarlo soprattutto su soggetti non in forte movimento o preferibilmente fermi e in condizioni di luce ottimale. Segnalo inoltre che sul mio esemplare, probabilmente difettato, il paraluce fatica molto ad entrare in sede. Consiglio comunque di orientarsi su ottiche pi√π rinomate usate In quanto non ci sar√† una grandissima differenza di prezzo, provveder√≤ ad effettuare il reso soprattutto per il difetto del paraluce.; it‚Äôs cheap but if you can afford the g master or the sony then go for it‚Ä¶although this one really works perfectly fine."

I have also observed that I don‚Äôt get more scratches on lenses.; I was under the impression it will have antifog quality- but nothing of that short. Anormal tissue will also do the same work.; Best product in market for cleaning spec. Works well. Just one drawback that is can be used only once. Once you open the packet and use the wipe it dries out later. Good for gifting as well; An excellent product for care of reading and dark glasses.; easy to use

Aligning is most important, installation is easy though, let's see how long it performs.; Camera lens are not proper fit for OnePlus 12 R; I have been looking for iqoo 12 camera protector lens for a while and finally found this one. This is a perfect fit for iqoo 12 and quality is also top notch. Its just i think after applying camera protection lens camera performance reduce a bit.; I ordered this protector for my Oneplus 12 phone's camera lens. The glue of this protector is very bad. It fell off from my phone 4 times within 5 hours of applying.
I applied this very carefully and made sure no dust particles are beneath it, but still it fell off.
O would not recommend others to buy this as it is failing it's purpose.; Super quality"

There, in plain English, it says, ""Gently brush away dust and dirt with the FOLDED WIPE. (Capitalization is mine.) Unfold and gently clean the surface with circular movements until clean and dry.""
So, what we have here is my failure to use the two-step cleaning process. Once I started that, I only need the one wipe to get my screens glossy clean.; Zeiss definitely knows optics so I had to give their lens cleaning wipes a try and I love them. I read many reviews on these and have to say if you read and follow the directions the results are what one would expect clean and clear lenses. I struggle with those who don't follow then provide a negative review sometimes just using a verified purchaser isn't enough to make an informed decision. I used these wipes on my glasses, tablet and mobile with excellent results and the wipes do dry so you need to use these immediately after opening and the quick-drying also allows for removing any streaks if you use a circular pattern in wiping the lens being cleaned.; I like to keep a simple on my reviews and only answer what people really care about. I do not do pictures or videos as I have a job and this does not pay my bills, it is just a way to help the regular Joe like me make an informed decision. I do not get free or discounted products for review, you will get my unbiased review of product.

Does it work?
Yes, I bought this to clean my eyeglasses and they clean very well. I have not had any issues with scratching or damaging of lenses. Make sure you use them only if they feel wet to the touch, do not use if dry.

Is it easy to use?
Yes

Pros:
Cleans glasses well, gets read of oils in lens.

Cons:
None

Note:
Do not use if dry; Zeiss makes two different types of pre moistened lens wipes. The original contains isopropyl alcohol and has a precaution on the back of the package stating ""on glossy surfaces, test a small area first"". A second version has the same packaging, however, in the front right corner is a circular area that states ""Alcohol free"". This package states ingredients less than 5% cationic and anionic tensides. There is no warning on the reverse side of this product. Now the confusing part for the consumer // The alcohol smell is very strong upon opening, however it dries quickly and should be safe for optics due to basically being on the market for years. Some users like one over the other stating it cleans better. I find the alcohol dries faster leaving less streaking,however, any streaking is easily removed with a microfiber lens cloth. Note some glasses have coatings that recommend not to use an alcohol product. To top it off, Apple on a enclosed note card with MAC Retina screens products states to clean with water."

I have to state they for the price, this is one of the best I have ever seen which will take your mobile photography to a completely different level. If instructions are followed well (like cleaning your mobile camera lens before shooting) then nothing can stop you from making some of the best images possible. I have attached two photos of flower and foliage and I can bet, you cannot get this sharpness and clarity from a normal mobile camera lens. I had mounted this on my iPhone XR and my word! What result already! I am yet to test these lenses extensively for instance the wide angle lens but I am confident that it‚Äôs result will be satisfying. Even in the macro images, the sharpness and the depth-of-field is really good! Strongly recommend those who wish to make wonderful mobile pics!

Oh! I missed mentioning the boxing of the product! You have to see it to believe it! It comes in a nice casing with slots and a loop to hang it in your trouser loop for instance. The lens look of professional quality and their covers are equally premium. Out and out a premium product in a great price!

I may update my review later on seeing the results of the wide angle lens too.; If u want to explore the wide domain in mobile photography, this lens is an effective device to upgrade to ur mobile. It serves the purpose what its meant for. Added with the macro lens combo is useful item in ur bucket. Following is my detailed review pls read whole. Also, do check the photos for best understanding to make ur purchase decision. Ignore the lens impression at corners in wide photos it happens due to misfit.

Installation :
Very easy. Clip on. Macro lens is default mounted. The wide lens sits on macro. As the lens center should match your mobile lens center, In mobiles with lens in middle, it fits best. For mobile with lens at top edge, ull have trouble sometimes to adjust as the clip wont fit properly. not all mobile at least I have some issues most of time while adjusting so it takes little starting time to make the propor fit. my mobile is Honor play lens at top edge. For mobile with lens at center of little down, its perfect

WIDE LENS :
PROS - Serves the purpose. it really gives 45% extra wide both horizontally and vertically. Wide stretchy impression happens at corners which is property of wide angle. gives satisfactory output. works best in non-direct sunlight, interiors, close focus shots, compact frames also good for landscape
CONS - Cant handle broad daylight too well as chromatic aberrations and dark edges are found at corners. it don't happen at non-direct daylight. see the photos ull get it. sometimes lens round impressions appear, thats the issue with proper fitting in edge lens mobiles

MACRO LENS :
PROS - Classy. satisfactory output. but u must have some knowledge on how to take macro shots, if u know the rules, bingo this lens gives good output. Very nice bokeh and yeah it happens to gives the wide essence even at macro. see photos.
CONS - U need patience. For the best focus u have to get as close as 1 cm, max 2 cm of the target object, otherwise no focus

Overall, i am satisfied with the lens. recommend everybody to buy as with this price range, combo of this lens is really impressive considering the output are commendable; It doesn‚Äôt fit on my phone and Amazon isn‚Äôt initiating a return pick up. Waste of money and time!; Will share the best way i have found personally to use this, considering i have a videographer that uses this lens with their iphone 12 pro max. Positioning it exactly around the camera is very important to ensure the edges of the screen are not blocked/blurred. The best quality and only way that we have found that works is using the 1x zoom/standard zoom.

In terms of quality it is great, feels good and all.

If you are using a gimbal, please note, that if you do not calibrate, or the gimbal is too unbalanced, the gimbal can shake a bit to compensate for the weight when moving fast, so keep that in mind.; The lens cap seems like used.. The package was disorted but lens is good.; SIGNI Pro 2 in 1 Mobile Camera Lens Kit

Capture extraordinary moments and unleash your creativity with the SIGNI 2 in 1 Lens Kit. Take stunning wide-angle shots with the PureView 0.45X Wide Angle Lens and dive into the world of macro photography with the SuperMax 15X Macro Lens.

Experience the joy of mobile photography!

Just as they claim the product to be military grade, I found the product to be of very high quality and this just adds to the beauty to the iPhone while not compromising on the safety.

Special shoutout and mention to the DIY tutorial videos and the ease with which the screen protector and camera bump protector can be installed.; The build quality is sturdy. And look is premium. It is going to protect your iphone not samsung so just go for it.; Just bought the product and started using it. Fit is good, looks good. Happy for now
I hope it won‚Äôt turn yellow soon. Will update after a few months; It is a good set for protection; The product built is good, but when it comes to yellowing the product is as good as any other cheaper variant.
I need protection of my phone as well as the look to be safely protected. The yellowing leaves a very bad impression and overall degrades the over all appearance of the phone.; ; The temper glass provided with this pack is not of correct size it is small & doesn't cover the screen,regarding the back cover it is average still will see after few month's for discoloration (if turns yellowish); Easy to apply and looks great. The lens covers are a lifesaver; I always order ESR cases and screen protector for all my phones. You're always sure to have a very good quality product at a good price !
This time, it was for my brand new Iphone 15 Pro. I bought the metal blue version so I wanted to have a nice clear case to show it off.
PROS:
- The case fits perfectly the phone
- The grip on your hand is perfect, not slipery
- Edges protect main screen and lenses
- Helper piece to easily install the lenses protection
- Kit inludes wet wipes, clean cloth and sticker to remove dust particles

CONS:
- Would have liked to have the front screen protector helper plastic piece, it ensure centering perfectly the protector on the screen. Usually, I was receiving one of those with my screen protection, but not this time. You will have to center the protector yourself on the screen, I had to peel it off after first try since it was not welled aligned, even with second try, placement was not perfect, won't try a third try in case I stuck particles on the sticky side of the protector.

BOTTOM LINE:
Very pleased with my purchase, highly recommend the product.; Die H√ºlle wei√üt gute Qualit√§t auf, scheint robust, und die Optik ist super.
Das aufbringen der Schutzfolie mit dem mitgelieferten Montagerahmen ist kinderleicht und bei ordentlicher Displayreinigung zuvor, erreicht man ein super Ergebnis. Auch der Kundensupport war super schnell zu erreichen und ein kleiner Mangel an der Kameraabdeckung wurde direkt wie gew√ºnscht per Austausch ersetzt. Alles in allem, sehr zu empfehlen. Gerne wieder.; Ho avuto un problema con la mia cover, ma tempestivamente appena ho contattato il servizio clienti mi hanno risposto e subito hanno cercato di risolvere il problema nel migliore dei modi. Prodotti di ottima qualit√† soprattutto per protezione massima, ma ancor di pi√π servizio top.; Recomiendo el producto. Se adapta al tel√©fono a la perfecci√≥n, incluso tuve un problema de deformaci√≥n y me enviar√°n una completamente nueva.; Having just bought a new iPhone 15 Pro I wanted a good case that would protect it and after some searching found this ESR set. The price of Apple cases is ridiculous but this looked to be a very good price for all that was included so I thought I would try it.
Firstly the case itself. It is very well made and fits my phone perfectly. I chose the matt black as no matter what sellers say about clear cases I think they always go yellow. This case looks very nice and has a good non-slip feel but it is not too rubbery so slips into my pocket easily too. It has a second set of yellow replacement buttons which I chose to use and they look great and work very nicely. The raised camera protection is good and the case also comes with a camera lens protector that clips on very easily.
The screen protector comes with an installation frame to make it easier to install. However, when doing so I accidentally snapped it into place a little too hard and the protector shattered. I mentioned this to the seller and got an immediate reply saying they would send me a replacement - so great customer support too.
The case is very sturdy and will protect my phone beautifully so at this price you really can't go wrong - very highly recommended."

Das Tamron ist das weltweit erste All-in-one-Zoom mit Lichtst√§rke F/2-2.8 f√ºr spiegellose Vollformat-Systemkameras

Positives:

Vielseitiger Brennweitenbereich: Die 35-150mm-Brennweite deckt eine breite Palette von Aufnahmesituationen ab. Von Weitwinkelaufnahmen bis hin zu mittleren Teleaufnahmen ist dieses Objektiv √§u√üerst vielseitig.

Beeindruckende Lichtst√§rke: Die durchg√§ngige Blende von f/2-2.8 ist beeindruckend. Dies erm√∂glicht nicht nur kreative Tiefensch√§rfeeffekte, sondern macht das Objektiv auch f√ºr Aufnahmen bei schlechten Lichtverh√§ltnissen √§u√üerst leistungsf√§hig.

Hochwertige Verarbeitung: Das Objektiv ist solide gebaut und vermittelt ein Gef√ºhl von Qualit√§t. Die Materialien wirken langlebig, und die Zoom- und Fokusringe lassen sich geschmeidig bedienen.

Schneller und leiser Autofokus (VXD): Der VXD-Autofokus arbeitet schnell und pr√§zise. Seine leise Arbeitsweise ist besonders bei Videoaufnahmen von Vorteil und beeintr√§chtigt nicht die Atmosph√§re ruhiger Aufnahmen.

Negatives:

Gewicht und Gr√∂√üe: Aufgrund seiner Lichtst√§rke und des gro√üen Brennweitenbereichs ist das Objektiv etwas gr√∂√üer und schwerer. Dies k√∂nnte f√ºr einige Fotografen, die nach einer leichteren Ausr√ºstung suchen, ein Nachteil sein. Wenn ich tr√§umen darf, dann w√ºrde ich mir ein Glas mit 24-150mm mit Blende 2-2.8 bei einem geringeren Gewicht und Gr√∂√üe w√ºnschen. Bei der selben optischen Bildqualit√§t wie das TAMRON 35-150mm.
Aber das ist konstruktiv vermutlich schwer oder unm√∂glich.

Preis: Der Preis des Objektivs ist etwas h√∂her, aber die gebotene Leistung rechtfertigt dies weitgehend. Dennoch k√∂nnte es f√ºr einige Budgets eine √úberlegung sein.

Insgesamt ist das TAMRON 35-150mm F/2-2.8 Di III VXD ein beeindruckendes Objektiv mit vielen St√§rken. Fr√ºher galt v als Hersteller f√ºr einfache und g√ºnstige Objektive. Die Zeiten sind endg√ºltig vorbei. Ich kenne einige Hochzeitsfotografen, die das TAMRON 35-150mm F/2-2.8 Di beim Shooting einsetzen. Es ersetzt bei mir immer mehr die Festbrennweiten, weil mir bei einem Body der Objektivwechsel zunehmend nervt. Zumal man beim Objektivwechsel unterwegs aufpassen muss, dass kein Schmutz in den Body der Sony Alpha kommt.

Well here are my honest opinions. Bought this today and will be giving my opinions on the difficult conditions where it struggles i.e the night and indoor... I attached 3 photos from which one is indoor... If you have a decent amount of light then it will not struggle to focus and track the subject. If a light is bit low like the black one it will take 2 to 3 time tos focus and checkout the post-processed image.. Was that dope?.. Lightroom things .. In daylight no doubt it can give the best it can give.. Didnt observe any low sharpness images.. however it can be fixed via other softwares .. Very small amout of color fringing can be seen which is quiet rare .. Low on price? Wants that background blur bokeh,,, close your eyes go for it whether Nikon or canon... Downside is only the autofocus... Not slow as snail neither fast as leopard.. Go for it.; Auto Focus is good. Better than expected from reviews. But it really hunts during night. Photos are little soft at F/1.8. But can't complain about this at this price point. For beginners you should invest on this for learning purpose. You won't get disappointed .; This lens is brilliant when it works, but most times misses the focus point. However it is the only lens that you can get with an autofocus motor inbuilt at this price point. I‚Äôd skip this if I were to buy this again.; Awesome picture quality one of the best quality lens with very low price; ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§¨‡•á‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§°‡§ï‡•ç‡§ü ‡§π‡•à,‡§ë‡§ü‡•ã‡§´‡•ã‡§ï‡§∏ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ, ‡§´‡•ã‡§ü‡•ã ‡§ï‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ü‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§¨‡•á‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§π‡•à‡•§

I use this lens in manual mode so for me motor sound and slowness is not problem but for auto mode it really makes some weird sound while rotating and focusing.

Plastic quality is low compare to Nikkors.
Without a tripod or monopod it can produce blurry image sometime but that's true with all the lenses.

Good Low light photography
Covering details; This is a perfect buy for budget oriented people .
Lens works fine ,the autofocus is average it keeps hunting for focus ,it is better to be used in manual focus mode .. the pictures taken are decently sharp they are not extremely sharp when compared with nikon lenses ... but for the price its a nice buy , I would recomend people to go for the nikkor lens which is about 12 k if you have enough money otherwise this is a perfect buy; It is a excellent lens for beginners new to potrait photography with primes,you get much more for what you have paid for, material is much better than the canon version of it. focusing was better too.It shutters a little while while focusing on lowlights,and a little less sharp in low aperture which is obvious,other than that it's perfect.For more pics you can visit my insta I'd. r_a_z_o_r_i_n_e"

"Sony E 11Mm F1.8 | Ultra-Wide-Angle Lens Prime for Aps-C Cameras, Content Creators (Black)","43,990",https://www.amazon.in/Sony-Ultra-Wide-Angle-Cameras-Content-Creators/dp/B0B2RZZBPN/ref=sr_1_305?crid=OOBID4Q0FLU9&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.hEqUEVUvLKJyH0afR4gaZ5IuGpGMhe6Y4YzRq3MPHRo.of0rKaqek1Xp79qWZA92qNitgw5KiUmu89t7gQoQYT8&dib_tag=se&keywords=camera+lenses&qid=1719214127&sprefix=camera+lenses%2Caps%2C249&sr=8-305,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mv-j+lWuL._SX522_.jpg,"Deep and expressive bokeh with a large F1.8 maximum aperture, 0.12 meter (0.4 ft) minimum focus and 0.2x maximum magnification*1 *1 Manual Focus. 0.15 meter (0.5 ft) minimum focus and 0.13x magnification when using autofocus.; With an 11 mm (35mm full-frame equivalent: 16.5 mm) focal length for dynamic movies and still images; Consistently high resolution right out to the image edges delivered by three ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass elements.; Compact (66 x 57.5 mm (2-5/8 x 2-3/8 in.) ) and lightweight (181 g (6.4 oz.)) design for extraordinary shooting freedom.; Two linear motors allow fast, precise autofocus and tracking performance for both stills and movies.","This is the ideal lens for dramatic landscape and architecture photography. Sharpness is extremely good at the center of the frame and even at the corners, AF is silent and fast which is expected given that its a new lens. Even though it's a prime lens you can use clearimage zoom to get more out of this lens without much loss in image quality. This lens doesnt have any image stabilization but at F1.8 its really not required even if you dont have any in body stabilization on your camera as you can see from the sample pictures; ; I already have 50mm 1.8 portrait lens and adding this 11mm to my lens collection.
Sharpness, auto focus and performance everything good. Value for money.; Really amazing lens for travels, vlogging and astro. Really wish it has stabilization but it's still an amazing lens to have. It's basically a fisheye lens which when cropped by the Apsc camera is equivalent to 16mm fullframe lens.
I have a sonyA6700 and this was my go-to for travel and Astrophotography.; this is very chip product and not returnable so carefully buy this product; Got used product; Defective product was sent. Focus and aperture not working but the main usual is when I requested for return they simply aren‚Äôt taking it back saying serial number not matching. Amazon is trying to scam me, in past also I had same experience with amazon.; Cercavo un grandangolare per la mia Sony A6700 e devo dire che questo sony √® davvero ottimo. Leggero, pratico e qualitativamente ottimo. Si conferma il migliore qualit√† prezzo.; La recomiendo calidad no puede ser mas top y la verdad para usar de webcam o vlogs va de perlas; Ich wollte ein Weitwinkelobjektiv f√ºr meine Sony A6600. Zuerst hatte ich ein Samyang 12mm AF f√ºr E-Mount bestellt, das katastrophale Bildfehler hatte. Ging zur√ºck. Das Sony SEL11F18 ist zwar teurer, hat aber eine ausgezeichnete Bildqualit√§t. Schon bei Offenblende ist die Sch√§rfe auch an den Bildr√§ndern sehr gut, das hatte ich nicht so erwartet. CA konnte ich nicht erkennen. Ja, es ist aus Plastik, aber leicht und unauff√§llig. Ich bin sehr zufrieden.; Great little lens, very sharp with some visible distorsion on the edges which is understandable with this kind of very wide optic. I use it mostly for landscape and night shots and northern lights photography.; This Sony lens is a cracker, fast and super sharp at all apertures, incredibly light weight and compact, fast silent AF, really close focus. There are no downsides, even the price is reasonable. Get it."

Had they used a anti-fingerprint coating it would help.; Would Recommend....
