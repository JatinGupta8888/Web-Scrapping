This mobile touch Working very smooth. Value of money; Pros -
1. 256gb + 4gb configuration
2. Decent performance
3. Looks stunning
4. Battery backup is ok but can be optimized with update
5. Above average speaker
6. Camera in daylight or in bright environment is acceptable
7. The provided case is really good.
8. 360 degree flashlight is cool
9. Display's viewing angles and overall quality is satisfactory

Cons -
1. FEW BASIC FEATURES LIKE DOUBLE TAP TO TURN ON AND OFF SCREEN, 3 FINGER SCREENSHOT ETC ARE MISSING WHICH IS VERY ANNOYING. THESE FEATURES ARE VERY BASIC AND I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW COME ITEL REMOVED IT AND WHY?
2. LOW LIGHT CAMERA PERFORMACE IS REALLY BAD.
3. PLAYSTORE AND YOUTUBE ARE NOT PROPERLY OPTIMIZED BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU ARE JUST SCROLLING IN THEM, THE PHONE STUTTERS AND HANGS WHICH NEEDS TO BE FIXED.
4. BATTERY BACKUP AUTOMATICALLY GETS REDUCED SOMETIMES WHICH ALSO NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

ITEL TEAM REALLY NEEDS TO PROVIDE ONE UPDATE ASAP TO FIX THESE MENTIONED DRAWBACKS BECAUSE SUCH BASIC FEATURES IF ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY OR ARE MISSING THEN PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO RECOMMEND THIS DEVICE TO OTHERS WITH FULL CONFIDENCE.

IF THEY FIX THESE ISSUES, THIS DEVICE WILL LITERALLY KILL THE 6-8K BUDGET SEGMENT. PLEASE FIX THEM ASAP.

(Please note all these pros and cons are mentioned considering the killer price at which it comes); I like this is mobile, this mobile desgin is very good, camera quality is too good, back side look is very cool & fabulous, bettery performence is very good, sound quality is also very good. This mobile touch Working very smooth. Value of money; Overall I am not happy with the performance of this iTel A70 moble phone.

Pros:
1. Very affordable
2. ROM and RAM are more than any comparable mobile of same price.
3. Screen resolution is quite good
4. Sound volume is okay though there is only one speaker at the bottom.
5. Overall build quality is good.

Cons:
1. Network connectivity is poor
2. Screen brightness is low compared to other models.
3. Has only one microphone, so cannot record in stereo.

I had applied for a return/refund for the product, but came to know that, as per their policy, it cannot be returned. They arranged for an inspection of the mobile to verify the problems at my place. An inspection agent called me up and asked me to provide the OTP which had been sent to me in my email. The email instructed me as follows - ""Please share the Job Start PIN with Service expert only after they arrive at your location. Do not share over call"". But the agent kept insisting for the PIN on call, saying that he would make sure that I get a refund. I finally gave him the OTP which was a big mistake. He made a report to Amazon that the issue had been resolved. This is a fraud being commited by these agents, I request everyone NOT TO PROVIDE PIN/OTP ON CALL. I am now stuck with a sub-standard mobile phone which I can't return for a better product. It is a shame that Amazon is happily selling these mobiles and refusing to return the product! AVOID BUYING THIS MOBILE PHONE if you can afford to spend Rs.1000 to Rs.2000 more.

Edit: After using the mobile for sometime now I feel that it is okay for light daily use like YouTube, WhatsApp, Facebook and general surfing, provided you have a strong WiFi signal. Keeping in view the affordable price of this phone, the 4GB RAM and 128GB ROM size is more than what we can desire. I have been using it for Facebook live sessions without much problems.; camera quality best, wide display , fast charging, battery backup good, touch is working smoothly, light weight, connectivity also good; Memory 256 is very good, charging to battery taking more than 3hrs. To full, camera is not good, camera looking is very good.; Itel A70 offers an attractive and affordable price with decent battery life and a user-friendly experience, making it a solid choice for basic smartphone needs.; Product is good. Earphones is missing.; جيد; جيد; موصفات غير; i order itel phone but damage; الأمانة مافي جوال بدون سماعة"

At first I was little sceptical about how things would go at this price range. I have used Vivo Nokia and Samsung at > Lava O2 budget and to be honest I am happy with this phone
Here are the pros of this phone:
Battery- 5000 mAh is good and lasts minimum of 7 hrs on heavy use and easily lasts a day on rough use
Charging time: 0-100% in nearly 2 hrs . Great! 4/5
Sound quality: sound quality is good but it doesn't really be hearable at low volume . A slight downgrade 3/5
Screen: To be honest, this has the best screen in this range or even above . Even my friends who owned mobile phones at the range of 15,000-30,000 had praised the screen of this phone. The punch hole display is a cherry on top of the cake. I could even see the screen at outdoors without any issues. Great! 5/5
Performance: The phone has a 8+8 combination of Ram and 128 gb ROM. I have tried various high end games on this phone and it's running good. Even it shows 30-40 Fps in COD mobile, but it doesn't feel like it,means it runs very smooth 5/5
I did also play solo leveling arise, Clash of clans,clash royale ,Bgmi ,FF , Farlight and asphalt series. All ran good in this phone . Best!
Storage: Imagine I have a lot of games in this phone simultaneously. Like all the above mentioned. I even have downloaded the expansion pack of some of the games completely. Still I have 50% of storage left. Means the storage system is great! 5/5
Camera: the camera setup is of 50Mp primary sensor with another one may be of potriat ig . But the camera is great . I had some very good photos but Amazon isn't letting me upload them . It has various camera modes and a good selfie sensor. Good! 4/5

Now for the cons:
Camera : After the update I got this problem . The camera lags while taking videos or photos. But in the gallery it is good. I hope the camera is maintained good in future updates
Charging issues: Not much issues but the phone gets very hot and thanks to the glass back 🙂 it just acts like salt sprinkled on a bruise
Device: Only after update I saw this problem. Sometimes when I open the app, the app suddenly closes and also closes each and every open tabs. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible
Touch sensitivity: Sometimes when I am grinding in fps games . When I press the attack button I have to press twice first as the button itself becomes unresponsive at first only. This has happened multiple times leading into losing the match💔

Overall the phone is great . Please resolve the issues seen after update as soon as possible. Kudos!; Nice Phone,Good Bounceback by Lava,
Phone Looks Good,Light weight and Working Smooth...Overall Very Good Smartphone In this Price Range...; I have purchased this LAVA O2 mobile, but it's not reached our expectations. I should replace the mobile. The main issue was call voice is not audible. There is some issue in the mobile. Looking forward to hearing from you positive response.
Overall the mobile is not good. Please replace the mobile.; Overall nice phone with regards to its design, performance, display, sound quality and battery. Very nice made in india phone at such price.; Very good 4G phone, with smooth finish and touch. Very good build quality. Stylish design.

Likes :
1. Proudly Indian
2. Clean Android 13. No bloatware. It's stock Android.
3. Premium glass back design.
4. Ultra smooth touch screen.
5. No lags as of now.
6. Fast fingerprint sensor.
8. Big memory inthis price (8GB, 128GB).
9. It's charging very fast.

Not likes:
1. May be better images expected with 50MP. But ok in this price. Need improvement in camera app.
Update1: updated and now camera is good.

It's truly competition to other brands.
Go for LAVA. Don't let your money go out of India.

#ProudlyIndian; Battery's drained in 6-7hrs, speakers volume is very low in compare to the Vivo phone.
Looks and screen is good. camera good; I was looking for phone for my Generative AI development work where I can memory for my Apps rather bloatware using that memory. Initially when I saw it there was no review but it was mentioned 8GB RAM and bloatware free Android Experience so I picked up and this phone has surprised me.

Here are few good points.
1) Bloatware free android experience and Only google Apps and two Lava Apps along with system apps.
2) Standby time it quite impressive
3) Phone design is also quite impressive
4) There is free phone cover and Phone charger which most of other companies are not providing now a days
5) Currently I am running large language model with Ollama and llama.cpp with models like llama3, phi3, mistral, sqlcoder, starcoder, gemma:2b, qwen and all other models ranging from 900 mb to 4.7gb size.
6) python, nodejs, open source web apps also working quite fast.

Considering All above in 7999 INR after coupon is great deal not only for user but also for developer, I expect LAVA to bring bloatware free experience with 16 and 32GB with 512/1TB internal memory in future at competitive price so that we can keep running bigger technology in Android mobile.

Thank you LAVA.; Lava O2 is the most fastest and amazing phone under 8k. I bought it for 7,499 in sale. It's performance has not disappointed me for once. Alltho am giving 4 stars because phone has heating issues. I've been using it for a few days so here's my opinion on the topics :-

• Battery life : Average for a 8k Phone can easily give a 6hr run time while playing games.
• Quality : Build Quality is 10/10. Phone gives an expensive look. Overall good.
• Camera : Average, back camera can be improved.
• Sound Quality : Sound quality is good too and speakers are fine as well.
• Gaming : Light gaming can be done but playing heavy games like BGMI and COD can cause heating. For normal gaming like roblox, Subway surfer, etc. . It's good.
• Heating : The phone heats up quite fast. It's heating the most while charging.
• Easy to use : It's actually smooth and it's ram is also good which gives a smooth experience.
• RAM and ROM : Compared to other companies, lava gives more ROM and it's 8gb ram is also very efficient. Expandable Ram hasn't been in much use but it's smooth.

You can't expect a 8k Phone to compete iPhone or other expensive phones. It's the best one in the segment. Go for it, it's Indian and efficient."

The display, touch ratio, battery, charging time, camera quality, performance, sound quality and the price all are very good.; Have been using the phone for over a week now.

Positives:

1. Snapdragon 782 processor is quite good. There is no lag whatsoever even on opening multiple apps and using for a long time.
2. Battery life is decent. It is definitely not a gaming mobile.
3. 5G services are accessible in most locations(in Hyderabad) wherever there is network.
4. Both front and rear cameras are decent. You can click good shots in Night mode as well. Photos taken in various modes viz., Macro, Extra HD, Night, Pro, Potrait are attached.
5. 80W fast charging is electric! I was able to charge my mobile from 23% to 100% in 17-18 mins and from 4% to 100% in 22-23 mins.
6. Audio and video quality is great. Get some good earphones and you will experience the theatre effect with Dolby sound.
7. No heating issue of any kind even after continuous usage/a long phone call.
8. 12 GB RAM is great. You can now multitask and open apps simultaneously.

Negatives:

1. Battery drains fast. Should have been built to last longer. Like I said, definitely not a gamer's mobile. However, phone will last for a day even with heavy usage.
2. Flagship 50MP Sony camera is a disappointment. Definitely not what an amateur photographer would expect. The moment you zoom in, image gets blurred and pixelated. Expected a much better camera from a mid premium mobile at priced at 30k
3. Most of the features were toned down from other premium versions of OnePlus. However, one would expect some premium features when spending almost 30k.
4. Back cover and screen guard are useless. Expected OnePlus to provide decent good quality default screen guard and phone cases. Please do buy both separately.
5. Audio/Video seems to just stop and then play on using YouTube. Might have to update the app and check if it is an issue with the device.
6. Absence of a 3.5mm audio jack is a big drawback for wired earphone users.

Update 1 : Have received the first update to Oxygen 13.1 within 2-3 days of purchase wherein video quality of camera and few other features were improved. Also, the video lag issue is now resolved.

Update 2: Received second software update on 23 Aug 2023 which is aimed at improving front/rear camera picture quality and optimizing the battery of the mobile when it is at rest.

Update 3: Received another software upgrade in early October aimed at enhancing Network connectivity and stabilization.

Update 4: Received Android 14 software upgrade on Jan 12 2024. Device is now stable.

Overall a decent buy under 30k segment. Expected better features from a premium smartphone but certainly not a big disappointment. Overall 4 stars. I would recommend this mobile to others.; Thanks for asking about my review on mobile phones. 📱 I think mobile phones have become an integral part of our lives. They offer so much convenience and connectivity. Personally, I really like the sleek design and advanced features of the latest smartphones. The high-quality camera allows me to capture precious moments, and the fast processing power makes multitasking a breeze. However, I believe it's important to find a balance and not let mobile phones consume too much of our time. What are your thoughts on mobile phones? 😊Hey! Thanks for asking about my review on mobile phone. 📱 I think this mobile phone have become an integral part of our lives. They offer so much convenience and connectivity. Personally, I really like the sleek design and advanced features of the latest smartphones. The high-quality camera allows me to capture precious moments, and the fast processing power makes multitasking a breeze. However, I believe it's important to find a balance and not let mobile phones consume too much of our time. What are your thoughts on mobile phones? 😊; Tired of MI and Samsung smartphone that are really advertising agency of third party apps, One Plus is a dream come true. It's star feature is the battery optimisation that kills all the battery draining apps. Icing on the cake are the dual Dolby speakers, crisp haptics and brilliant camera. With a 15 minute charging time , this phone is a lotus no doubt in a muddy pond of fat underperforming smart phone; I bought this phone at 19k, and for this money this is a good phone. Ticks all the right boxes, has all the required things like charger, cable, case and screenguard in the box unlike some other companies. Gray back is shimmery, looks cool. Phone is lightweight despite big battery. Charging speed is lightning quick and battery runs long enough. OS is smooth, got 3-4 updates just after setting up. Camera is fine too, no complains. Casual games run smooth, haven't tried any heavy game which I anyway don't play.

Two observations though:
1. Battery sticks at 100% for a very long time, which is strange and not accurate. But overall battery backup is good. See the screenshot.

2. It's good it supports HDR on Netflix and Prime etc, and has a toggle for make the screen bright when playing HDR content. But it doesn't work at all. If your screen is dim it remains dim. You have to manually push the light level to the max. In general auto light sensor keeps the screen a bit dim for my liking, and unlike my Samsung Galaxy S20, it doesn't remember if I have increased the level, it still keep diming the screen to preset level. In my Samsung, the auto level changes the light including manual inputs so I don't have to fiddle with it very often.

Upart from these two niggles, phone is good.; I gifted this phone to my mother she likes gaming on this phone very much. It never lags. No issues with performance, Cam quality, sound quality, Charging, Camera, and other features at all.; Everything in this phone is fantastic even I loved it's fast charger but the only thing is not upto the mark is it's battery Backup.
I need to charge it twice daily but it's a good thing that it takes only 30-40 min to get fully charged.
Everything else is very good expect battery Backup"

Overview: Having used a Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro for five years, I recently switched to the Redmi 12 5G (6GB/128GB). Despite its promising specifications, the overall experience has been disappointing, lacking the reliability and features I previously enjoyed.

Call Quality and Features: The call experience with the Redmi 12 5G is plagued by frequent drops and network issues. The absence of a visible number typing area on the keypad and malfunctioning call recording further hinder usability. Additionally, mistouches during calls and the lack of a Bluetooth icon exacerbate usability issues. Furthermore, accidental calls to random contacts due to mistouches during calls add to the frustration.

Messaging: Despite granting all permissions, saved contacts' names do not display, making it challenging to navigate messages. The inability to differentiate messages from unknown sources exacerbates the issue, as spam messages appear with misleading identities.

User Interface (UI): The default UI is cumbersome, lacking essential customization options like horizontal menu pages. Third-party launchers like Nova Launcher are necessary for improved functionality, but gesture support is limited to the native HyperOS. UI lag and unresponsive notifications further mar the experience.

Gallery and File Management: The gallery's organization is subpar, especially when distinguishing between internal storage and SD card content. Similarly, the file manager lacks basic search functionality, forcing users to manually scroll through directories.

Camera and Speaker Quality: The camera performance falls below expectations for the price segment, producing subpar images. Additionally, the speaker exhibits erratic volume fluctuations, impacting audio quality during media playback.

Handling and Display: The device's larger-than-expected size makes single-handed use difficult, leading to wrist discomfort. Outdoor visibility is poor due to inadequate brightness levels, resulting in reflective screen surfaces.

Battery and Charging: While charging speed is acceptable, the battery life necessitates multiple charges for a single day of normal use, diminishing user convenience.

Second Space Feature: The Second Space feature fails to match the functionality of Samsung's Knox, lacking essential capabilities such as seamless data transfer between spaces and restricted clipboard access.

Comparison and Concerns: Comparing similar models like the Poco M6 Pro reveals discrepancies in pricing and specifications, indicating potential deception in the market. Such practices undermine consumer trust and warrant caution when considering Xiaomi devices.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the Redmi 12 5G (6GB/128GB) fails to deliver on basic functionality and user experience, making it an unsatisfactory investment. Prospective buyers are advised to explore alternative options to avoid the frustration and inconvenience associated with this device.; ; Not much durable. Battery drains fast. Camera is ok but picture quality doesn't look like 50MP camera. No slow motion video capture feature is available. Fingerprint senser at the side sometimes doesn't capture. Connectivity is ok.; All about good but camera quality low..; Received in good condition. The product included mobile case and charger along with mobile. Looks really nice."

Excellent value for money mobile. Good Camera, Good battery life of full 2 days+ and more with moderate usage without gaming. Display quality is good but not as good as other Samsung super AMOLED. Display brightness in direct sunlight is low and may be problematic to see in direct sunlight. Camera photo capture sometimes feel little slow, other apps processing is MODERATELY FAST and NO LAG and NO HANG, VERY SMOOTH PERFORMANCE except gamimg because I did not do gaming in this phone. Photos have good moderate quality details in good lighting conditions. To get full 2 days or more than 2 days battery life, changing the default frequency to 60 Hz from 90Hz may be very helpful from the settings menu. It has Automatic Call Recording option inbuilt so you can record all calls without any external app.
Overall M14 5G 6GB 128GB is an excellent value for money 5G mobile phone with 13 5G bands with very good 5G connectivity.
I would have called this a perfect value for money mobile if Samsung had given its Super AMOLED display in this mobile.; Before settling on the Samsung M14 5G, I was considering three different models: the Redmi 12 5G, Moto G54 5G, and M14. Through my research, I found that the G54 had heating issues and the Redmi 12 had camera issues. As a general user who was looking for a good phone with good battery life and good call quality, I ultimately chose the M14.

In terms of network capabilities, this phone works best on 5G/4G and supports 13 bands on 5G, VOWIFI, and has 4G aggression which works seamlessly. The only feature missed was VONR. One feature that I found particularly useful is voice focus, which cuts background noise perfectly( particularly when you are train or noisy environment). The phone also has dedicated slots for SIM and SDCard.

Battery backup is amazing and can sustain for at least 2 days no matter how you use it. However, the camera is average and the rear camera is worse than the front camera. The Samsung UI is very good and supports dual apps (dual WhatsApp), and RAM management is good, though most of the time only 2GB of RAM is free. If you have a Samsung TV, this phone works flawlessly with it.

The phone comes with the latest Android 13 out of the box, and Samsung guarantees updates for OS and security updates which is a plus. The speaker is loud enough for calls and listening to YouTube videos. There are no bloatware apps, though there are a few that can be uninstalled.

One major con is that the phone does not come with a charger inside the box, only a C to C type cable. I ordered a 20W boat charger which works perfectly but comes at an additional cost. The biggest con I see is the display, which is very bad in outdoor conditions even when set to full brightness. If you are an outdoor person, I would recommend avoiding this phone. The phone's appearance is very basic, and the back looks very plasticky (can be covered with a case). There is no punch hole camera.

Overall, if you are someone who makes long phone calls and wants a phone with good battery life and call quality, the Samsung M14 5G is a great choice.

Update 2: I came to know that 3rd camera which is a 2MP depth does nothing here, its better to go for F14 than this as you can save approx 1k instead of buying( may be you can buy a samsung 25 w fast charger with that money), all others specs are the same. The phone feels very heavy on hand mind it.
Update 2:
Just got the android 14 and one UI 6 update. Got additional features like VONR and 3 more shooting modes in camera. Phone is smoother than earlier. Worth the investment.; I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed. Samsung has managed to strike a perfect balance between performance, affordability, and 5G capability with this smartphone. As a tech enthusiast, I have used various smartphones, but the Galaxy M14 5G stands out for its exceptional features and budget-friendly price. Here's an in-depth review based on my experience.

Design and Build Quality (5/5):
The Galaxy M14 5G boasts a sleek and stylish design. The phone feels comfortable in hand, thanks to its ergonomic build. The slim profile and lightweight design make it easy to carry around. The build quality is impressive, considering the price point, and the device feels durable.

Display (4.5/5):
The 90 Hz 6.6-inch LCD display offers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and excellent contrast. The Full HD+ resolution provides sharp and detailed visuals, making videos and games look stunning. The only slight drawback is the brightness under direct sunlight, but it's manageable.

Performance (5/5):
Powered by a capable Exynos 1330 Octa-core processor and 4/6GB of RAM, the Galaxy M14 5G delivers smooth and lag-free performance. Multitasking is a breeze, and apps load quickly. Gaming performance is impressive, handling graphic-intensive games with ease. The 5G connectivity ensures faster download and streaming speeds, making it future-ready.

Camera (4.5/5):
The camera setup on the M14 5G is commendable for its price range. The 50MP main sensor captures detailed and sharp photos in well-lit conditions. The 2MP ultra-wide lens is great for capturing landscapes and group shots. The 2MP depth sensor provides good bokeh effect in portrait mode. The low-light performance is decent, producing usable photos with minimal noise.

Battery Life (5/5):
Equipped with a 6000mAh battery, the Galaxy M14 5G offers impressive battery life. With moderate usage, the phone easily lasts a full day, even with 5G connectivity enabled. The optimized software ensures efficient battery management, allowing users to enjoy extended usage without constantly worrying about charging.

Software and Features (4.5/5):
The phone runs on Samsung's One UI Core 5.1 based on Android 13, providing a clean and user-friendly experience. Samsung's software enhancements, coupled with regular updates, enhance the overall user experience. The phone supports Face Unlock and a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, both of which work reliably.

Value for Money (5/5):
In terms of value for money, the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G is a winner. It offers a feature-packed experience usually found in higher-end smartphones at a fraction of the cost. The inclusion of 5G connectivity at this price point is a game-changer, making it an ideal choice for budget-conscious consumers looking for future-proof technology.

Conclusion:
In summary, the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G is a stellar budget smartphone that exceeds expectations. It combines a sleek design, vibrant display, powerful performance, capable camera setup, excellent battery life, and 5G connectivity, all at an affordable price. Whether you're a casual user or a tech enthusiast, this phone delivers exceptional value for money. I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G to anyone in search of a reliable, feature-packed, and future-ready smartphone without breaking the bank.; It is a good phone i've been using it for more than a year now it is decent for gaming like it can run bgmi at a constant 30 fps because it has an exynos 1330 processor but it is perfect for multitasking and web browsing due to its 5g compatability. It looks beautiful in its berry blue colour and it has a super fast charging of 25v. Its camera is perfect for this range and the stability of this decice is also good ."

First, let's discuss the design. The Moonstone Silver color is stunning and gives the phone a premium appearance and feel. The curved edges and thin size make it easy to handle and fit into my pocket. The 6.5-inch Full HD+ display is bright and clear, ideal for streaming videos and gaming. The Redmi 12 delivers excellent performance. I have enough room to save all of my programs, photographs, and movies with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The phone is powered by a MediaTek Helio G35 processor which ensures smooth and lag-free performance. I have been able to multitask effortlessly and haven't faced any issues with the phone slowing down. The following pros and cons are after using this phone for months.

Pros: 5000mAh Battery
128GB+ 6GB+1 TB expandable storage
Beautiful Design with curved edges
6.5inch big screen

Here’s why I love it:

Design and Feel:
First off, it looks and feels premium. The sleek design and solid build make it feel way more expensive than it actually is. It's comfortable to hold and use, which is a big plus.

Display:
The screen is gorgeous. The AMOLED display is bright and vibrant, making everything from videos to games look fantastic. Plus, the high refresh rate makes scrolling and animations super smooth.

Performance:
Even though it has a weaker processor compared to other upper mid-range smartphones, the performance is still really good. Apps open quickly, and multitasking is a breeze. I’ve played some pretty graphics-heavy games on it, and it handles them surprisingly well.

Camera:
The camera setup is really impressive. Photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light. The extra lenses for wide-angle shots and close-ups add a lot of versatility. It’s perfect for snapping great photos on the go.

Battery Life:
Battery life is solid. It easily lasts all day with heavy use, and the fast charging is a lifesaver when you’re in a hurry. No more waiting around for your phone to charge!

Software:
HyperOs is smooth and feature-packed. It takes a bit to get used to if you’re coming from another brand, but it’s intuitive and has a lot of useful features.

Overall, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ is a fantastic choice if you want a high-quality phone without spending a fortune. It delivers great performance, a beautiful display, and a top-notch camera all at an affordable price. Definitely recommend it!

Bonus: There's no heating issue observed when doing demanding tasks!; First of all let's go with the pros
Display: the best thing I liked about this device is it's display am first time using an amoled curved display and it's soo good it's super smooth with 120hz and the colors are good too and within a week this device fall from about 6 feet and 3-4 times and there was not even a scratch it shows the victus protection does it's job well
• some of the users claim that the 120 watts is not working it's taking about 50 mins but actually if you try to charge the device out of the box it will shows that 120w quick charge but you need to go to settings>battery and switch on the boost charging then only it gives you true 120w potential in 19 mins
• I had test the device dipped in water for 15 mins and still there is no issues found so the ip68 also works good
• And i got and update from miui to xiaomi hyperos
And the ui is also super smooth without any bugs found
• and about gaming the device gives a smooth experience I played freefire in max settings in high fps and still I got about 50fps and i tried e-football ect.. And the device heats up a bit still not overheating in gaming I didn't found any shutters or lags it works smooth
Cons:
I think this stuff is a bit overpriced
The camera is not up to the mark in these price range
But still it can be fixed with a software update
And the battery drains fast I don't think it's 5000 mah my 5 yrs old vivo gives more backup than this but still 120w just full in 19 mins
And the other features are good about these device the cons can be just fixed by an update and after all i love these phone don't mind the negative comments just go for it and i have a suggestion it's bit over priced so you can buy it on offer times and it's not an performance oriented device if you are a gamer or looking that types of phne you can go for iqoo neo 9 Or something and that's all about these device I think this review may help you and i I'll update if I faced any prblms thank you😊; I am using REDMI NOTE 13 PRO+ since last one month. Totally satisfied with the performance of the device. Display is very good and smooth. 100W Fast charging is excellent. Battery life is very good. Both the camera front and rare is beautiful.

And I asked to the Amazon customer care they refused to take it back and advised me to approach Mi service center. I'm from Chennai so it's pretty easy to find service centre here so i approached them very next day and they told me there's 7 days replacement so they taken my defect mobile and told me it will take 10-15 days so I'm waiting for the New mobile as of now. Already it's been 7 days i advice people who are looking for low budget mobile don't go with poco. This brand become famous for their defective products.

Realme Narzo 7G Pro 5G: कम बजट में दमदार प्रदर्शन

Realme Narzo 70 Pro 5G किफायती दाम और फीचर्स के बीच संतुलन बनाता है. यह एक स्मूथ 120Hz डिस्प्ले, 5000mAh की लंबे समय तक चलने वाली बैटरी के साथ 67W फास्ट चार्जिंग और लेटेस्ट Android 14 सॉफ्टवेयर समेटे हुए आता है. साथ ही, यह एक अनोखा फीचर - टचलेस कंट्रोल के लिए एयर जेस्चर भी पेश करता है.

अहम बातें:

1. शार्प और स्मूथ डिस्प्ले: गेमिंग और स्क्रॉलिंग के लिए एक शानदार और रिस्पॉन्सिव 120Hz डिस्प्ले का आनंद लें.

2. बारिश या धूप: इनोवेटिव रेनवाटर स्मार्ट टच आपको गीले हाथों या नम स्क्रीन के साथ भी फोन का इस्तेमाल करने देता है.

3. दिन की रोशनी में फोटोग्राफी: 50MP SONY IMX890 OIS मेन कैमरे के साथ अच्छी रोशनी की स्थिति में स्पष्ट तस्वीरें कैप्चर करता है.

4. फास्ट चार्जिंग चैंपियन: 67W फास्ट चार्जिंग के साथ जल्दी से फोन को चार्ज करें और कभी भी बैटरी खत्म होने की चिंता न करें.

3. फिसलने वाली ग्रिप: कुछ यूजर्स के लिए इसका डिजाइन थोड़ा ज्यादा स्मूथ लग सकता है.

निष्कर्ष:

Camera performance is good enough capture nice details; I have been using this phone past couple of days and here are my personal experience with the device.
Performance 4/5.
Although this is not the best performing phone is this price point but still i have not felt that because its really good and can run bgmi at smooth+extreme(that is the only game i played on this).
Software 5/5.
realme ui is known for bundling so many bloatware and ads but this phone had none of it, no hot apps and hot games and you can just disable apps like app market, game center etc. This probably might be the most smoothest smartphone is this price range, the animations and all are soo good. Haven't seen a single bug yet.
Battery 4/5.
Its pretty good, i got 6.5-7.5 hrs sot on really heavy usage like 4.5 hours gaming and on 5g network.
Camera 3/5.
I was kind of Disappointed with the camera despite having such a capable sensor(imx 890 same as one plus 11 Series). The colors are so saturated and unnatural. There is also a lot of oversharpening in the image and just ruins the details. The low light performance it pretty good and video quality is also pretty good but you dont get stabilization in 4k. I did download gcam which made things 100 times better than before.
Extras.
The speakers are really good
haptics are just okay
amazing network reception and wifi performance

One of the standout features of the M34 is its glossy finish, which adds a touch of elegance to its design. It not only looks extraordinary but also feels premium in the hand.

If you're in the market for a reliable smartphone that excels in photography, gaming and performance, the Samsung Galaxy M34 is definitely worth considering.; It Is good but camera quality bad.volume better. Touch display is smooth.; Performance is 4/5. Quality is 5/5. Display is best. Battery is good. Camera is 4/5. Perfect phone for this price range.; लगभग 2 महीने M34 5G (6gb RAM 128GB ROM ₹18999 without charger) हैंडसेट को उपयोग करने का बाद इसके बारे लिख रहा हूँ।
1. इसकी sAMOLED स्क्रीन पर कंटेंट देखना बहुत ही शानदार अनुभव है लेकिन यह यूट्यूब पर अधिकतम 1080p60 को ही सपोर्ट करता है । अगर 4k सपोर्ट करता तो और भी बढ़िया रहता।
2. 6000 MAh की बैटरी है लेकिन बैकअप उतना अच्छा नही है। यह 5000 mAh की तरह परफॉर्मेंस देती है। कंपनी लैब में टेस्ट करके इसका बैकअप बताती है। लेकिन कस्टमर्स तो लैब में इस्तेमाल नही करते ना।
3. फिंगरप्रिंट सेंसर- इस प्राइस रेंज में स्मार्टफोन में indisplay फिंगरप्रिंट सेंसर दिए जा रहे है जबकि इसमे साइड माउंटेड है, जो भी कभी कभी अच्छे से काम नही करता है।
4. 4 साल का OS UPDATE और 5 साल का SECURITY UPDATES इसकी स्टेबिलिटी को बनाये रखने के लिए अच्छा है।
5. कॉल करके कान लगाने पर proximity सेंसर ठीक ढंग से काम नही करता है।
6. GAME SECTION..…….…..…..… i am not mobile game lover.
7. वर्तमान में अमेज़न और अन्य शॉपिंग साइट्स पर यह 15000 के आसपास आ रहा है तो इस प्राइस पर यह बेस्ट है पर 18999/20999 पर लेना बेवकूफी है। इससे अच्छा तो आप इस प्राइस पर किसी दूसरे ब्रांड पर चेकआउट कर सकते है, जहाँ आपको चार्जर इयरफोन मोबाइल कवर इत्यादि साथ मे मिल जाते है।
8.exynos 1280 इतना दमदार प्रोसेसर नही है। इसमे हीटिंग issue है । इससे पहले मैंने redmi note 9 pro use किया था। rn9प्रो की परफॉर्मेंस इसके मुकाबले बहुत ही शानदार रही थी।
9. Youtubers जिस तरह इसके कैमरे के बारे में बताते है कि ""ओह भाई क्या कैमरा है, जबरदस्त, वगैरह वगैरह... उतना शानदार तो नही है । कैमरा average है।
10.25 wt charging is good not best. It could be 33 wt. At this price .
11. Single speaker, not stereo but sound is ok.
12. Drop notch, dosent matter.
13. Its very heavy due to big baterry.
14. Sometimes it lags.
15. There is no notification light.
16. There isn't N77 5g band.
17. It's processor EXYNOS1280 is very poor. It's heats. And after heating it's automatically switch from 5g to 4g.
Buy this phone,It was my mistake.; But software is good; It take too much time to charge. Heating problem. Good picture quality 👌. Over all good performance. Sufficient memory space.; Average quality & performance is good in battary backup & good for daily use, but very poor in camera quality in third party video call applications; This is actually a good 5G smartphone to buy for day to day usage like web browsing, social media, movies & videos, online classes & meetings, basic gaming etc.
Camera is perfect in this price ample storage is available.
Last but not the least peace of mind because of non Chinese brand and availability of Knox security also the bonus is Made in India product.; Haben das Handy für unsere 88jährige Mutter gekauft. Ist für Ü60jährige das perfekte Handy, wenn Sie Wert auf ein Handy mit guten Ladezeiten und einer Alltagstauglichen Kamera legen. Klare Kaufempfehlung.; The Phone had been Set and Pre-Installed with Apps eg Amazon meaning somebody had interfered with it! A New Phone is always on Factory Settings; Venendo da un Galaxy M31 (ancora perfettamente funzionante dopo 5 anni), ho potuto apprezzare la maggior rapidità di esecuzione del processore e gli aggiornamenti del sistema operativo. Le fotocamere sono buone, stabilizzate e scattano buone foto in tutte le condizioni di luce. Forse avrei preferito un sensore ottico con maggior definizione tipo quello del M31 da 64 mp ma comunque anche questo da 50 grazie alla perfetta ottimizzazione del processore Exynos fa bene il suo lavoro. Le foto sono nitide e i colori molto carichi ma reali nelle tonalità come da tradizione Samsung. Insomma tanto per intenderci, se fate una foto ad una Ferrari di colore rosso, vedrete il rosso Ferrari originale e non un violetto o bordeaux o un non so non si capisce... come con certi cinesi tipo il Redmi. Ottimo lo schermo
super Amoled da 120 hz con protezione gorilla glass. É dual SIM o SIM più micro SD rimane comunque una valida soluzione anche se avrei preferito tre slot indipendenti come nel M31. La batteria? Eccezionale... 6000 mA che durano a seconda dell'utilizzo, da 2 a 4 giorni. La modalità ""risparmio energetico"" di default disattiva il 5G che come tutti sanno è più energivoro. Grazie a Smart Switch di Samsung il passaggio di tutti i dati da un telefono all'altro è stato rapido e in dolore. Il software è spettacolare, grazie all'implementazione Knox del processore Exynos, sono disponibili una serie di protezioni aggiuntive secondo me ormai indispensabili. Dalla protezione delle app presenti, a quelle contro quelle fraudolente che si rischia di installare a propria insaputa navigando sul web. La protezione di accesso al telefono tramite cavo type c collegato a computer, garantisce la sicurezza dei dati sensibili anche se il telefono viene rubato e sottoposto a scansione da computer esterno. La privacy dei dati sensibili è così garantita e credetemi, oggi non è poco... E' presente il solito antivirus fornito da Samsung di default, che a richiesta scansiona le app. I video si registrano in 2K 30 fps stabilizzato o in 4K 30 fps non stabilizzato e sono di buona qualità. Altoparlante mono più jack da 3.5 nella parte inferiore, sul lato destro volumi più tasto accensione-spegnimento con lettore impronte integrato. Audio in chiamata e microfono ottimi come molto buona la riproduzione audio dell'altoparlante mono quando si guarda un video. Se come me avete l'abbonamento a Google One per estendere lo spazio di archiviazione, avrete anche con il Galaxy M34 5G (così com'era con M31) tutte le possibilità di editing immagine di Google Photo così come avviene con i Pixel. Dall'ottimizzazione dell'immagine alla gomma magica ed altro ancora ... Questo è decisamente un grande punto a favore di Samsung (che è in partnership con google), perchè come sanno ormai anche gli aborigeni (con tutto il rispetto che meritano), Photo di google possiede il miglior algoritmo per l'editing fotografico al mondo. la dimostrazione è che i Pixel che vende google hanno come risoluzione massima solo 50 mega pixel ma grazie all'ottimizzazione del software scattano foto bellissime. Con Galaxy M34 5G è un po la stessa cosa, anche se non allo stesso livello. Nella confezione non è presente il caricabatteria. Io uso quello originale del vecchio Samsung del M31, non sarà da 25 W ma va benissimo lo stesso. Insomma per 197 euro non si può pretendere di più, anzi è un'affare.; Buen teléfono con batería duradera.; Really good phone and very good price"

• Display is very good. Comes with FHD+ with a big screen size ideal for consuming multimedia.
• Build quality is good.
• 90Hz refresh rate is there but needs to be selected manually during mobile setup. This gives smooth UI experience.
• Although it's too early to comment, but performance has been satisfactory with optimum RAM management. This mobile is capable of delivering all your daily tasks.
• Got update of Android 14 as soon as I completed mobile setup. Comes with MIUI 14 on top of Android. Hence, people looking to experience stock android needs to give a second thought.
• Camera is average. So, people who are looking for camera phones don't go for this.

This was my experience with the phone. For more detailed review definitely check out YouTube or other resources.; Review based on 3 week useage
Pros:
1. Amazing looks, backside glass is just amazing
2. 5g wroks flawlessly with jio and airtel
3. Battery lasts for one full day of average useage (I am not a gamer)
4. Having Radio feels so gopd😊

Cons:
1. Camera quality not up to the mark
2. Some finance apps like BHIM a bit slow (not sure ig app issue or phone issue)
3. Volume is average

Overall, very good cost to features phone. 5 stars.; The Redmi 12 5G, despite its touted 50-megapixel camera and promises of advanced gaming capabilities, falls significantly short in delivering a satisfactory smartphone experience. From an underwhelming camera to the absence of crucial features, this device fails to live up to expectations.

Camera Performance: The 50-megapixel camera on the Redmi 12 5G is more hype than substance. While the megapixel count might impress on paper, the actual picture quality is far from impressive. The images lack the sharpness and detail that one would expect from such a high-resolution sensor. Colors appear oversaturated and unnatural, and low-light performance is plagued by excessive noise and grain. The camera's performance is a clear letdown, failing to capture the essence of moments in a way that would be expected from a flagship feature.

Missing Features: It's baffling to see that the Redmi 12 5G lacks essential features that have become standard on smartphones today. The absence of slo-mo functionality is a glaring omission, especially considering how popular and versatile slow-motion videos have become in modern content creation. Additionally, the device lacks a proximity sensor, making the experience of handling calls and using certain apps needlessly cumbersome. These missing features highlight a lack of attention to detail and a disregard for providing a comprehensive user experience.

Dual App Support: One of the conveniences that users have come to expect from modern smartphones is the ability to use dual apps, allowing for separation of personal and professional accounts on various platforms. It's disappointing to note that the Redmi 12 5G fails to offer this feature, making it inconvenient for users who rely on dual apps for managing their digital lives efficiently.

Gaming Experience: Contrary to the promises of a great gaming experience, the Redmi 12 5G struggles when it comes to gaming performance, particularly in games like BGMI. Frame rate drops and lag are frequent occurrences, leading to a jarring and frustrating gaming experience. This inconsistency in performance hampers the device's ability to deliver an enjoyable gaming session, especially in fast-paced games that demand smooth responsiveness.

In conclusion, the Redmi 12 5G disappoints on multiple fronts. The lackluster camera performance, missing features like slo-mo and proximity sensor, the absence of dual app support, and subpar gaming experience in BGMI collectively make this device fall short of its potential. As consumers increasingly demand well-rounded smartphones with a seamless user experience, the Redmi 12 5G's shortcomings are glaring reminders of its inadequacies in the competitive smartphone market.; Smooth and Good based on its cost; Good and superior quality product... But need to be work on battery for more efficiency because it drain very early.

Thanks

Redmi 5G; Bought this phone for my father. It is a good phone with all rounded features.
Screen is wide and is nice for watching YouTube. Connectivity has no issues after updating all system apps. MIUI seems a bit slow but you can speed it up by reducing animation speed in developer options. 5G works perfectly (tested with Jio and Airtel).
Camera is decent enough, alternatively you can install GCam also for better results. Speaker sound was little bit less than expected and proximity sensor doesn't turn off mostly during calls but it is manageable as I feel that it can be solved with an update.
Overall I find this phone an excellent value proposition for 10-20k range as it offers all features including 3.5mm headphone jack. I got the 8GB + 256 GB version.; Good for normal use. Camera quality is not good. Phone lagging problem. Fast charging."

I try to return it but the Amazon said this option is not available and you can replace it through MI service center but the MI service center denied to replace because the phone is having the same quality.

So I don't suggest this phone to anyone; Very much satisfied 👍; (1) Fingerprint sensor responses 3 tomes out of 10. (2) Long charging time (3) Battery life 24 Hrs at the most for ordinary use, no game, no video recording, only net use and working with data. (4) Heating problem with playing video. (5) Display fine.

Its a clear equivalent of Redmi 12 5G except NFC. I saw many users write about it having ads and bloatware, issues with battery drain, etc. As soon as it was put on the network, it downloaded Xiaomi HyperOS1.0.1.0 UMWINXM, ANDROID 14. The update was 4.4GB, took some time but the OS is as smooth as MIUI 14/ Android 13.
Battery drain can be simply reduced by using the Battery saver mode. Further, you require to fine tune on background apps and disable ads, remove recommendations to reduce irritation. Camera is decent. Processor performance is good, no lagging. However, the famous quickball has been removed. For those interested to still want it on the device, the apk has to be installed additionally. For me, I like that wonderful feature as it was a life saver in older Poco/ Redmi/ Mi phones when the Menu/ Home/ Back navigation panel failed. With Quickball, my Redmi 3s is still working perfectly since last 7.5+ years. So, I did load the quickball version 15.0.1.0.1 and being tested.

POCO phones are always the beta for 'go to market' followed by the equivalent redmi versions. I have been using POCO (F1, C3, M3) user for many years, are truely worth the money, good hardware.
Many came with a 6000mAh battery but this one has 5000mAh battery (Hence ****). The charger is fast (22.5W) but I prefer to slow charge the battery at night with a 5V/ 0.7A or 1A charger to improve the battery life, reduce the risk of battery bulging. Due to no heat-up (Li-ion does not like heat, hence slow charging is safest), battery remains safe and long lasting. The box came with its own transparent back-cover but I prefer a thicker back cover.
Has a single Loudspeaker, hence lower audio volume (Hence ****). The protective film also had a small bubble (Hence ****). But the Screen is bright, even 30% is good for normal use.
The most important feature of Xiaomi is the backup and restore, making the new phone have the exact look of your old Xiaomi phone in less than 5 minutes, some apps may not get backed-up.
Finally, Amazon delivery was on time. Its just 4 days of testing and as of know I am satisfied.

Update after a week of use- Though the download speed is good, the phone does not show 5G (JIO SIM) on its display (it shows 4G+). This is an important part to resolve, probably a patch may be necessary if at all this is a bug, since the service provider detects it as a 5G phone but the phone itself shows 4G+. Requesting Xiaomi to validate my finding and close this accordingly.
When the same SIM is put in another phone (Samsung/ IPhone), it shows 5G clearly. So this is an issue to be resolved by XIAOMI to prove that it is genuinely a 5G phone.
No heating issue noticed after a week of use now.

UPDATE 2:
We can force the network setting to 5G through developer options as 'NR' in Set preferred network type. But the battery drains drastically, hence avoid that. So the phone is obviously 5G when network setting is forced. Obviously all may not want to touch developer mode, so best to leave it as 5G/LTE in normal network settings. If XIAOMI patches to augment the setting as NR only in addition to common settings, it can show up 5G on the display, but at the cost of high battery consumption.

UPDATE 3 (16 April 2024):
The legendary Xiaomi Quickball (apk version 15.0.1.0.1) has been tested and found to be working satisfactorily. Post hardening of HyperOS, the phone is almost AD free. Google loaded its own 'Messages' apk which will take control of the inbuilt default 'Messaging' app I have kept the Messaging app as default for messages as I dont want to use messages app of google for privacy control. Battery being 5000mAH, is found to be lasting for 2 days with mobile data 'ON'. A 6000mAH battery would have been better as found on many earlier POCO phones. Quality of hardware is very good and performing. With the new HyperOS 1.0.2.0 loaded, 2 years of formal updates makes it a an economical phone with good features. Reminding all that ads-free performance can only be achieved after hardening through developer mode. I havent used memory boost function, I dont think I will require it with a 8GB (uses LPDDR5) memory. Only if needed, I will configure it. I have also installed a 128 GB memory card, which virtually reduces internal memory usage.

UPDATE 4 (18 April 2024):
A bug is identified on HyperOS. When Wifi calling is ON and Wifi is connected with a stable network, outgoing calls cannot be made. Incoming calls also do not get through. I have tested this multiple times. Xiaomi has to immediately act and fix this bug. Upon putting WiFi calling OFF, the phone resumes normally. This problem did not exist on earlier MIUI used by me.

Except this new bug identified and therefore stopping Wifi calling (actually stopping wifi calling has improved the battery life, so I dont mind not having this feature as JIO network does not have issues in our area and around), POCO M6 Pro 5G is a decent value for money. Most positives, smaller negatives for a phone in 11-12k range. Surely, Xiaomi should action it with a patch immediately.

UPDATE 5.. Only for MIUI phone users, wont work for other phones (18 May 2024):
When POCO M6 Pro is fully configured, take its backup using Additional Settings--> Backup and restore. A backup file is generated in MIUI folder under AllBackup--> Backups--> Filename with backup date. Simply copy that file and move it to your old Mi/ Redmi/ POCO phone (min. Android 10) in exacly the same folder. Then restore that file. While it will replicate the phone, you will get the benefit of the new look Control Centre. The old MIUI Control Centre will be replaced by the new HyperOS Control Centre with no change to Android Version or security patch. I liked this look and have retained the new HyperOS Control Center in my old POCO C3, which is a backup of the new phone (in case of exercising Disaster Recovery option). Its like the old Car in a new shell. Havent had any issue on that since last 15 days of using the HyperOS Control Centre in the old POCO C3. Others can enjoy too.

Regards..... AD; Pros :
5 g - future ready
Good hardware configuration
Good battery
Good build
Good looks

18 w slow charger for 5000 mah phone battery.

Overall verdict
Performance & budget friendly 5g quality smartphone that can last 5 years is this phone.

Camera lovers , fast charging & wireless charging feature lovers should definitely stay away.

Best buy in this price segment. Future ready & durable. Very good build quality & touch screen display is very good at this price point .

Instead of wasting 7 to 8 k on average phone brands with bad configuration.better to go for a good one like poco by redmi.; Used 6 months. It is Good at this price point. Go for 8/256. Its an average phone for basic uses and storage.

* Slow charging and Battery doesn't last for a day.
* Decent Camera, definitely not for vloging or high-quality photography. good for memory capturing or important record/doc capturing...
* Good Screen resolution.
* NO heating so far.
* great processor, No lagging till date.; I bought this phone for my mom. I will try to keep this review short for potential buyers.

Pros
1. Display is decent. Not HD but decent.
2. Camera is nice. Even the night vision pics are fairly clear.
3. 5G connection is smooth.
4. Battery performance is quite good.

Cons
1. Lags a bit on heavy usage.
2. Feels slightly heavy as a device.
3. Back glass cover is a finger magnet. And you have to be careful with it, cause I see potential for cracks.
4. Doesn't offer higher resolution for videos on Yotube.

I purchased it under an offer, & received extra discount. At under 10k price it is a decent device to have.; Processor
is good at this price range, BGMI performance is decent with medium setting.

Display
is bigger but I'm disappointed with its brightness. Company claims 1300 nits but I don't think it is more than 800 nits.

Is very average, 30 mins of gaming and nearly 15% battery drops. The company claims it to be 5000 mah, but I'm sure it is not more than 4000 mah. It drops very quickly.

Charging
is pretty good and faster. 30 mins of charging gives 30% battery life. But due to very low battery quality, you might need to charge it twice a day.

The phone is lighter than majority of phones, and look wise it is more attractive.

Camera
Is the best part I liked the most. Any other phones don't have such camera quality at this price segment.

Ram Rom performance is v.good and storage of 128gb is enough. With 6 gb Ram. This phone is ditto copy of Redmi 12, but that is at ₹12500, only difference is the branding. I suggest you to buy this one Poco m6 pro, which is way cheaper.

Sound Quality is decent at this price.
Rest all the features performs really well and I bought this at a discount @ ₹9999.
I'm happy with this product for the price I paid.

If you can afford ₹3000 than this range, then definitely go for some other options, because poco has boasted this product a lot. It is 20% less than what is claims.; I am using this phone from past 15 days. Its a good device according to its price. Only issue is its battery. Battery backup is not good and even the charging time is long. Othervise performance is good, build of the phone is also good. Overall a good phone at this price range; Pros; big and handfriendly display,beautifully built,affordable,android14.cons ; feeble and hardly audible sound from cheap bottom firing single speaker,very bad rear cameras,selfie camera is OK,I will not recommend to buy,battery is draining fast eventhough chip is 4nm"

Can be used for two days without charge

Pros:
Clean UI experience. No bloatware
Better camera. Realistic skin tone and color
Light weight for the size. Easy to handle

Cons:
Back of the phone is plastic . So smudge/scratch possible. Better to have back cover
Image from camera can only be viewed after 2 seconds. Some processing after taking image; Glyph lights are cool; this mob totally waste camera quality total waste no use of buying this mobile
my money total waste
this mobile not worth
if anyone planning to buy this mobile its total waste; This phone is for you if you are looking for a sturdy, smart and practical phone with a neat user experience. The phone surely feels premium in hand and looks distinct from other devices.

UI is amazing. No bloatware, clean design and lot of emphasis on practicality and user friendliness.

Another department where phone scores very high is it's battery. It easily last for 2 days if you are an average user.

The only area where phone underperforms is the camera. Despite good specs , the image quality is snot consistent. Colours are often saturated (even after the latest update) and the edge detection in potrait mode is still a struggle. Hopefully Nothing team will roll out more updates to improve and stablize the camera of the phone.

Overall, a great product at this price point.; I always carry iphone and pixel for work and personal use. I have never bought anything else beyond these brands but as i needed a spare phone, and so i thought to try Nothing phone 2a and it works beautifully being a budget phone.

Packing was good and the box is sealed. You have to peal the side to open the box, same as an iphone. Phone is new and looks beautiful. Wish i could buy white.

A very good buy.; Best camera; Gud; There is no Advance technology.... Version like old LAVA series Cells .. But Fast and gud to use"

At first I was little sceptical about how things would go at this price range. I have used Vivo Nokia and Samsung at > Lava O2 budget and to be honest I am happy with this phone
Here are the pros of this phone:
Battery- 5000 mAh is good and lasts minimum of 7 hrs on heavy use and easily lasts a day on rough use
Charging time: 0-100% in nearly 2 hrs . Great! 4/5
Sound quality: sound quality is good but it doesn't really be hearable at low volume . A slight downgrade 3/5
Screen: To be honest, this has the best screen in this range or even above . Even my friends who owned mobile phones at the range of 15,000-30,000 had praised the screen of this phone. The punch hole display is a cherry on top of the cake. I could even see the screen at outdoors without any issues. Great! 5/5
Performance: The phone has a 8+8 combination of Ram and 128 gb ROM. I have tried various high end games on this phone and it's running good. Even it shows 30-40 Fps in COD mobile, but it doesn't feel like it,means it runs very smooth 5/5
I did also play solo leveling arise, Clash of clans,clash royale ,Bgmi ,FF , Farlight and asphalt series. All ran good in this phone . Best!
Storage: Imagine I have a lot of games in this phone simultaneously. Like all the above mentioned. I even have downloaded the expansion pack of some of the games completely. Still I have 50% of storage left. Means the storage system is great! 5/5
Camera: the camera setup is of 50Mp primary sensor with another one may be of potriat ig . But the camera is great . I had some very good photos but Amazon isn't letting me upload them . It has various camera modes and a good selfie sensor. Good! 4/5

Now for the cons:
Camera : After the update I got this problem . The camera lags while taking videos or photos. But in the gallery it is good. I hope the camera is maintained good in future updates
Charging issues: Not much issues but the phone gets very hot and thanks to the glass back 🙂 it just acts like salt sprinkled on a bruise
Device: Only after update I saw this problem. Sometimes when I open the app, the app suddenly closes and also closes each and every open tabs. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible
Touch sensitivity: Sometimes when I am grinding in fps games . When I press the attack button I have to press twice first as the button itself becomes unresponsive at first only. This has happened multiple times leading into losing the match💔

Overall the phone is great . Please resolve the issues seen after update as soon as possible. Kudos!; Nice Phone,Good Bounceback by Lava,
Phone Looks Good,Light weight and Working Smooth...Overall Very Good Smartphone In this Price Range...; I have purchased this LAVA O2 mobile, but it's not reached our expectations. I should replace the mobile. The main issue was call voice is not audible. There is some issue in the mobile. Looking forward to hearing from you positive response.
Overall the mobile is not good. Please replace the mobile.; Overall nice phone with regards to its design, performance, display, sound quality and battery. Very nice made in india phone at such price.; Very good 4G phone, with smooth finish and touch. Very good build quality. Stylish design.

Likes :

8. Big memory inthis price (8GB, 128GB).

Not likes:
1. May be better images expected with 50MP. But ok in this price. Need improvement in camera app.
Update1: updated and now camera is good.

It's truly competition to other brands.
Go for LAVA. Don't let your money go out of India.

#ProudlyIndian; Battery's drained in 6-7hrs, speakers volume is very low in compare to the Vivo phone.
Looks and screen is good. camera good; I was looking for phone for my Generative AI development work where I can memory for my Apps rather bloatware using that memory. Initially when I saw it there was no review but it was mentioned 8GB RAM and bloatware free Android Experience so I picked up and this phone has surprised me.

Here are few good points.
1) Bloatware free android experience and Only google Apps and two Lava Apps along with system apps.
2) Standby time it quite impressive
3) Phone design is also quite impressive
4) There is free phone cover and Phone charger which most of other companies are not providing now a days
5) Currently I am running large language model with Ollama and llama.cpp with models like llama3, phi3, mistral, sqlcoder, starcoder, gemma:2b, qwen and all other models ranging from 900 mb to 4.7gb size.
6) python, nodejs, open source web apps also working quite fast.

Considering All above in 7999 INR after coupon is great deal not only for user but also for developer, I expect LAVA to bring bloatware free experience with 16 and 32GB with 512/1TB internal memory in future at competitive price so that we can keep running bigger technology in Android mobile.

Thank you LAVA.; Lava O2 is the most fastest and amazing phone under 8k. I bought it for 7,499 in sale. It's performance has not disappointed me for once. Alltho am giving 4 stars because phone has heating issues. I've been using it for a few days so here's my opinion on the topics :-

• Battery life : Average for a 8k Phone can easily give a 6hr run time while playing games.
• Quality : Build Quality is 10/10. Phone gives an expensive look. Overall good.
• Camera : Average, back camera can be improved.
• Sound Quality : Sound quality is good too and speakers are fine as well.
• Gaming : Light gaming can be done but playing heavy games like BGMI and COD can cause heating. For normal gaming like roblox, Subway surfer, etc. . It's good.
• Heating : The phone heats up quite fast. It's heating the most while charging.
• Easy to use : It's actually smooth and it's ram is also good which gives a smooth experience.
• RAM and ROM : Compared to other companies, lava gives more ROM and it's 8gb ram is also very efficient. Expandable Ram hasn't been in much use but it's smooth.

You can't expect a 8k Phone to compete iPhone or other expensive phones. It's the best one in the segment. Go for it, it's Indian and efficient."

Here’s why I love it:

Design and Feel:
First off, it looks and feels premium. The sleek design and solid build make it feel way more expensive than it actually is. It's comfortable to hold and use, which is a big plus.

Display:
The screen is gorgeous. The AMOLED display is bright and vibrant, making everything from videos to games look fantastic. Plus, the high refresh rate makes scrolling and animations super smooth.

Performance:
Even though it has a weaker processor compared to other upper mid-range smartphones, the performance is still really good. Apps open quickly, and multitasking is a breeze. I’ve played some pretty graphics-heavy games on it, and it handles them surprisingly well.

Camera:
The camera setup is really impressive. Photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light. The extra lenses for wide-angle shots and close-ups add a lot of versatility. It’s perfect for snapping great photos on the go.

Battery Life:
Battery life is solid. It easily lasts all day with heavy use, and the fast charging is a lifesaver when you’re in a hurry. No more waiting around for your phone to charge!

Software:
HyperOs is smooth and feature-packed. It takes a bit to get used to if you’re coming from another brand, but it’s intuitive and has a lot of useful features.

Overall, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ is a fantastic choice if you want a high-quality phone without spending a fortune. It delivers great performance, a beautiful display, and a top-notch camera all at an affordable price. Definitely recommend it!

Bonus: There's no heating issue observed when doing demanding tasks!; First of all let's go with the pros
Display: the best thing I liked about this device is it's display am first time using an amoled curved display and it's soo good it's super smooth with 120hz and the colors are good too and within a week this device fall from about 6 feet and 3-4 times and there was not even a scratch it shows the victus protection does it's job well
• some of the users claim that the 120 watts is not working it's taking about 50 mins but actually if you try to charge the device out of the box it will shows that 120w quick charge but you need to go to settings>battery and switch on the boost charging then only it gives you true 120w potential in 19 mins
• I had test the device dipped in water for 15 mins and still there is no issues found so the ip68 also works good
• And i got and update from miui to xiaomi hyperos
And the ui is also super smooth without any bugs found
• and about gaming the device gives a smooth experience I played freefire in max settings in high fps and still I got about 50fps and i tried e-football ect.. And the device heats up a bit still not overheating in gaming I didn't found any shutters or lags it works smooth
Cons:
I think this stuff is a bit overpriced
The camera is not up to the mark in these price range
But still it can be fixed with a software update
And the battery drains fast I don't think it's 5000 mah my 5 yrs old vivo gives more backup than this but still 120w just full in 19 mins
And the other features are good about these device the cons can be just fixed by an update and after all i love these phone don't mind the negative comments just go for it and i have a suggestion it's bit over priced so you can buy it on offer times and it's not an performance oriented device if you are a gamer or looking that types of phne you can go for iqoo neo 9 Or something and that's all about these device I think this review may help you and i I'll update if I faced any prblms thank you😊; I am using REDMI NOTE 13 PRO+ since last one month. Totally satisfied with the performance of the device. Display is very good and smooth. 100W Fast charging is excellent. Battery life is very good. Both the camera front and rare is beautiful. It gives some great picture even at low light. This is the most value for money phone available in the market.; When I opened my box, it has some query but no one is taking responsibility to resolve or replace it . It has battery drain issue and again camera is not at all good. Redmi note 9 has batter camera than this phone; Heating in nirmal usage, Fast charging not working while using the phone this is very irritating thing, Laging if it is using 120 refresh rate. Not smooth. Display is good. Camera is good but not extra ordinary performance. Weight is also heavy. I dont recommend.; A very good phone camera is very smooth In 60fps .. night shoot is not good this is day camera . Charging very fast within 25 min battery full; Superb phone in this budget; Sometimes there is a lag issue and battery is kinda bad .Remaining else all good; منتج سييييئ جدا ولا يعمل وقد طلبت ارجاعه واسترداد المبلغ ولم اعهد ذلك من سوق ضخم كأمزون لتني اثق بمبيعاته ولكن صدمت هذه المرة"

1-Battery: Battery lasts fairly long for 90hz, big screen. Initially there was battery drain due to bloatware. I had to disable some apps to optimize battery.
2-Design: Smartphone has nice design overall. The only reason why I bought this phone.
3. Performance: Snapdragon processor is another good attribute of the phone. I'm using 6gb variant. Performce was smooth for browsing and videos.
4. Gaming: I tested BGMI, Dead trigger on high settings. I got 60 fps without any frame drops. This is amazing performance for this price. I suggest 6gb variant for gamers(If you want to play lag free).
5. Network: The phone is very much capable of 5g. I got 400 Mbps on certain location. However, 5g networks are not optimised yet. I'll suggest to select 4g only mode(if you are facing issue with 5g).
Display: Good enough.

Cons:-
Screen Record: Cannot record screen@60 fps. At least 720p@60 fps should be there. Processor is very much capable.
Camera: Cannot capture @60 fps videos.
A big problem for content creators. Otherwise good.; Redmi 12 is looking and performing good. Fast charging and battery life is good. Camera is also good. Overall it is value for money product; The quality of the mobile is amazing and it's value for money, this is the best 5G Budget mobile. The only cons of this device is Camera quality is low and sound is less in this device. Overall it's best device for normal use (you can't expect much in this budget). The Display Size is huge and comfortable holding it in hands...; Wow nice but sound is little low; Everything is good, except battery and camera, as the camera is not good and battery is giving almost 6 hrs of backup after full charge.; Value for money 💰👍 , sturdy packaging and amazing display 👍; Battery is getting drained very fast. Rest all good for me.; I'm surprised to find that it has very slow charging, so even if it's promoted as a mid-range semi premium phone, it actually falls at the bottom level. I actually bought it as a secondary phone for heavy media consumption to keep my main phone free. But, even if you want to enjoy binge watching, YouTube and Amazon Prime, you're disappointed to find that it needs 2+ hours to charge fully to be able to restart your weekend media consumption. And, it's promoted as a media friendly phone....I think it's one of the last slow charging phones in the 12K+ price range and they will likely disappear from the market soon."

The first thing that caught my eye was the smoothness of its 120 Hz refresh rate. Navigating through the home screens, scrolling through social media, and even just browsing the web feels incredibly fluid and responsive. This feature alone has significantly enhanced the overall user experience for my mom, who isn't always up-to-date with the latest tech but can appreciate a device that runs smoothly and without lag.

The screen quality is another standout feature. The vibrant colors and sharp resolution make everything look more appealing, from photos to videos. My mom loves to watch cooking videos and tutorial clips on YouTube, and the display quality makes her viewing experience so much better. Additionally, the large screen size is perfect for her to see everything clearly without straining her eyes. But what really makes the Realme Narzo 70x a fantastic choice is its affordability. Despite its high-end features, it comes at a budget-friendly price, offering great value for money. This makes it an excellent option for anyone looking to give a loved one a quality smartphone experience without breaking the bank.; Good Product in this price. Camera Quality is good enough. Battery life is not good. Sound is good.; I bought this phone for study purposes, I came to know that it is way more than that,
I will simply write the pros and cons:
Pros: BATTERY: Phone charges within 1h 20m and lasts whole day.

DISPLAY : No doubt 120hz ultra smooth
PERFORMANCE: Never lags
HEATING: NO HEATING seen till now, it's been a week I purchased it.
CAMERA : 50MP camera takes too good photos however better choices are available if you go for camera.
Sound: this phone has speakers at top and bottom both
Cons:
The camera module bulges out i dont like it.

Conclusion : if you want to buy a budget gaming device, then go for it
It is for students, no doubt.
This Mobile is also for them who want to do coding , editing etc.
Connectivity is good in this Mobile phone with a lot of more features and Ease of use.; For its price of 12k (6/128):
•good display, design, charging speed& build quality.
•decent camera, audio (distorts at higher level), performance.

Got black lines on screen within a month of using (see the photo). Now i can't even ask for replacement from Amazon. Going to realme service centre to get it sorted out.. will keep y'all updated with how this ends up.

Update1- Visited the service centre & after little bit of argument the service centre guy accepted the device (after having few calls with higher executives) for screen replacement free of cost. However, due to congestion & election going the display will arrive after 4th June. Will update after 4th wether they stick to their promise or backtrack.

Update 2- Display is completely gone. See the last image.; The display is cool. Looks premium. Charges pretty fast. You max the volume over 100%. So for watching movies or series online, I think it's one of the best smartphones.; I am using this since 1 month and putting down all the observations here.
At first sight it looked beautiful. When i grabbed it alongwith the provided cover, felt little on the heavier side and somewhat bigger to operate for people having smaller fingers.(switched from redmi note 10)
Perfomance is good for this price range.
Loved the little tweaks it has done.
Rear camera is ok ok.
Front camera takes beautiful pictures.
45W charger provided in the box does its job well.
I am not a heavy user, so its perfect for me.; I like it but sometimes while playing a game it lags & frame drops but at the price rate it's OG definitely go for this
The camera is all best AI
AI gestures is a good feature to scroll some reels by hand in air
Battery life is quite good
Display is best
Quality is uhlalala
Weight is the lightest
Absolutely value for money; 5g network and charging speed are good.
Rest of all features, quality, performance and sound are average and not good."

Though fast charging is a good compensation, it'd have been great if the power consumption could have been optimised.
No regrets though! The phone and camera both work great.; My reviews are accurate and I am a daily frequent user.
Pros :-
1. Big Curved great looking display for content watching.
2. Battery Back Up is Really Good with 4G ( Shifted to 5G battery drain is very fast. And this is natural All kind similar phones are also give you the same )
3. 5G to 4G shift is very less ( Calling time shifted only )
4. Refresh Rate is good. App open and smoothness is very Fast.
5. Lightning Fast Finger Print Capture.
6. Night Mode / Low Light Photos are great with back camera even within sunlight also.
7. Average Gaming is Acceptable.
8. No Hang Issues / Lag Issues. Try to buy 256 GB varient.

Cons :-
1. Little Heated at the time of charging.
2. Little Heated When Using 5G for 1 hrs. Constantly.
3. Front Camera is Okay Type.
4. Bloatwares.

Verdict:-

If you are confuse to buy IQOO Z7 Pro / Infinix Zero 30 / Moto Edge 40 Neo ?

If you take my advice then never purchase it.; I bought the mobile and did all the set up work. then I put it to charge for 2 hours mobile only charged for 23%. there was 7 days service center replacement so I went to MI costumer care and asked for Replacement but they denied. somehow after 2 days they agreed for replacement. After 3 days i got the replacement mobile. WHich was actually used product and it had same charging issue. After that again i faced a lot of problem with MI costumer care and at MI service center...
The twist in the story is that MI costumer care told me that on the 8th day when i went there, they told me that the product will be repaired and not replaced or refunded. I was so angry at them. I had not used the mobile for 7 hours and my 7 days replacement was over due to MI Company (China Brand) carelessness. But amazon helped me with refund.

I will never buy any chinise brand product again in my life....; I got it for my mom and it's a lovely and reliable device; Reviewing after using 1month. Look wise this phone is superb. Camera is average ,not seems like 108mp camera. No hang is there. Very good touch experience. Charging is also superfast.
Since I have noticed 2 issues.
1. Battery is draining too fast.
2. Heating issue is also there.; Best phone in this price range 😍; I think it's a good mobile. Not too fast processor, light weight nice feel to use and heats up in warm conditions. Value for money and the sound dolby was nice experience, nice camera 4.2/5
Gaming was not cool, not any game space for cooling, battery goes down moderately; നോ ഡാമേജ് ബെസ്റ്റ് പ്രൈസ്"

Package was packed properly. Thanks to amazon; Quality of the phone exterior is good, it's not a great build but worth the money. Now the UI experience is again not so fast, but works well for a budget friendly phone. Colour ratio on screen is great. Camera is great. My 1st budget friendly phone which is great. Fingerprint is good and fast. Charging is slow with the given adapter. Overall for 6.8k I will not say it's bad neither mind-blowing.; Best mobile within a best price, speed and battery life is good enough; Fortunately I captured video of unboxing. From the first i tried to start the mobile but the side buttons are not at all working somehow I managed to switch it on. But i couldn't lock the screen or use volume buttons. This purchase is for my mother and her's first new mobile came with defect I'm totally disappointed. And I asked to the Amazon customer care they refused to take it back and advised me to approach Mi service center. I'm from Chennai so it's pretty easy to find service centre here so i approached them very next day and they told me there's 7 days replacement so they taken my defect mobile and told me it will take 10-15 days so I'm waiting for the New mobile as of now. Already it's been 7 days i advice people who are looking for low budget mobile don't go with poco. This brand become famous for their defective products. Even if you take risk it will be better if you're in city or you have Mi service center near you.; One of the affordable and good quality product with very reasonable price. Loved it. Apperance, display is good. Camera quality is good.; Budget phone looking very nice large display size battery one day performance guarantee. major problem sound very poor improve the sound quality very low range sound YouTube videos sound quality very poor.

Ram management is excellent. watching videos and multimedia experience is a pleasure. battery backup is great. only con in camera department is there is no 2x or 3x zoom camera. primary camera is fantastic. there is no IP rating. loudspeakers are pretty loud and clear. been receiving regular updates. so far very solid experience from iqoo; A perfect phone at this price range. The iQOO Neo 9 Pro is a mid-range flagship phone with a focus on performance. It has a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor up to 12GB of RAM and a 144Hz LTPO AMOLED display. Although 144 hz feature is only available for gaming. The camera system is decent, but not great, with a 50MP primary sensor and an 8MP ultra-wide sensor, the main 50 MP sensor is good enough for day to day nornal photography and 8 MP sensor is average, battery life is good, and the phone supports fast charging and the speed of charging is mesmerizing. The most important thing to mention that unlike other brands you will get 120W charger in the box which is best thing. Moreover, there are some pre-installed applications in the phone which I think don't need to be there. Overall, the iQOO Neo 9 Pro is a good option for gamers and power users who are looking for a phone with a lot of performance for the price.
Here are some key pros and cons of the iQOO Neo 9 Pro:
Pros:
* Powerful performance
* Smooth display
* Good battery life
* Fast charging
Cons:
* Average camera system
* Not the cleanest user interface; PictureQuality :- By saying my pictures I have uploaded on Instagram or other social media all are asking that are they captured by using Apple iPhone ? And I have captured some pictures for my relatives and my neighbours and pressure on best social media the same asking their friends too. .. that's a shocking and wonderful review for me. I have used my eye controlled o
Portrait 2x mode for capturing portrait nearby good pictures... Also this phone battery is good by using from the dawn to dusk, battery drains but it full within 10 to 15 minutes.
Continuous using this phone with internet not tempting hot feel .
It selfie camera have no flash but it is quite good..
Android 14 and all the apps are working hood with the enough I have and expandable Ram option.
Also it's support infrared , so we can use this phone as a remote to TV DTH, AC, FAN AND MANY IR SUPPORTING devices without any third party applications.
It's processor is feeling much good Snapdragon 8 gen 2.
Style and finishing also quite impressive, smooth and good function.
Some small negatives :- this has only internal storage no memory card support
3.5 mm earphone chat is not available, al3so latest all phones are r supporting C type audio wired earphones. Otherwise you need to purchase AC type to 3.5 m converter for your existing earphones.
It supports multiple devices and change over connection are also good manner.
Kuchh supports 2.4 and 5G Wi-Fi also we can customise 5G Wi-Fi hotspot.
Also built in screen recording option available.
In designs slim: & compatible no much weight feel.; Yes! while charging it gets warm, it doesn't bother me because it is charging with 120 watt adaptor, many people complaining because they might switched from 10-20 watt charging speed!
While gaming it stays cooler, you will not be noticing any huge amount of heat or any performance drop, constant performance 85-90fps in bgmi.
Front camera is decent for selfies but not good for videos.
Back camera is better, good for both videos and photos!
I just personally felt, it gives better battery back while ultra gaming mode is on(all the time), compared to when it is off!
Just turn off the notification and uninstall the app you don't like, you're good to go!
I don't have any complain with the product, It fulfills my requirement!
Value for money product!; Likes: The phone has got good specifications for the price. It can handle any kind of task thrown at it. The back is vegan leather (only on red and white models) and feels amazing to look, hold and feel, with a nice grip. Battery is large enough to last a full day even on the most busiest of day. Camera performance is great during the day and night, comparable with most flagship phones. Screen is sharp and colours are bright and vivid even in sun.

Dislikes: Gets a little warm while charging with supplied charger. However older slow chargers works well of you are not in a hurry. The phone doesn't have NFC, and hence you cannot use features supported, including tap and pay."

The phone came with a defective display with a yellow tint around the edges.
The defect can easily be noticed in the attached image, on the left is the defective yellowish display of Redmi 12 5g as compared to the white display of my current phone.

Amazon Customer Care accepted the defect on call, yet asked me to visit the Mi Service Center to get the brand new phone replaced.
I was forced then forced to rush to the nearby Mi Service Center, where the executive acknowledged the defect, and asked me to submit the brand new phone at the center.
The replacement phone was dispatched by Mi same day and was received next day.

Although my problem was resolved, but overall experience of buying phone online via amazon was traumatic.
Also the experience and quality of service provided at Mi Service Center was like a government office.
I was really worried when they asked me to submit a brand new phone with them. Anything could have happened.

In future, I would prefer buying a phone from an offline store which is nearest to the given brand Service Center.; Functioning well since the date of purchase.

5500mah battery can easily last upto 2 days even after heavy usage. On moderate or average usage it gives you 3-4 days backup. And most important, 100 watt supervooc charger will charge it within 25 minutes, its a big adapter and weighs just like a brick.

50MP+8MP main camera setup is a functional camera setup and a 16MP selfie camera, its not gonna disappoint you but don't compare with those camera centric smartphones, this phone is heavily on performance side but still it is giving you a good camera.

Display is superb, amoled display that gives you high definition media quality.. bazzles are almost non existing and gives you a premium experience like flagship displays.

Comes with O-Haptics feedback and completely like Iphones..really loving it...

8GB RAM+8GB virtual RAM with 256GB UFS 3.1 ROM makes it superb and most importantly there are many of phones that gives you 12GB of RAM in this price range but don't look at the numbers, the biggest factor is brand and performance. Point to be noted, Its 8GB RAM is better than Realme, poco vivo or oppo 12GB RAM....

After starting the phone, you will start getting updates within a week, and will get many of new features even not described in specifications,, its a surprise for you...they are gonna give you even more features in updates that will make it a flagship killer..

Oneplus is just similar to Samsung or Apple, is better known for making premium and flagship devices, so I will not compare these brands with any other brands,,they are reliable and doing a great job in smartphone market, you can chose any one of these three brands..; Reviewing after 20days of usage.
Good performece won't say this phone is best but okay for normal usage not for gaming or super heavy user purpose. Display is decent thumbs up for it.
Camera is mediocre, battery run for whole day, good thing is it super charged with 100W charger from 20-100% in 30minute
phone is not heating as other are saying, althought it's normal for smartphone to get heated while charging so it happens with this one.
played Pubg fro 4-7hours non stop at HD settings it worked smoothly. Their is high performance mode and 120hz settings so not to worry we can turn it on for heavy usage like gaming but it will consume more battery.
Screen is is visible bright in outdoors against sunlight..
Phone will take around 20gb of storage for system.
my current occupied storage is 44gb with apps out of 128gb.
Phone UI is good not best, good thing is their is no bloaware their are some apps which we can disable easily.
with 20days of calling, gaming, heavy video watching i m satisfied with the product..no issue for now.
Even I dropped mistakenly this one it's fine with the cover nothing bad happened.
I m 1st time one plus user very happy, I also bought 1year extended warranty from official one plus website...so I have 2yrs manufacture warranty at extra Rs.599.
phone body is plastic nd fits good in big hands, small hand people will face problem holding the device.
Final suggestion yes go for it if you are normal usage watching videos, running different apps for various task, calling also decent but speaker is not too loud on call but that's acceptable.Price could have been lower around 18k or 20k something.
Bought at 24.5k.. of which 22k is price and 2.5k GST.; I usually not write ✍️ review very fast when it comes to smartphone. First I need to use it and under rigorous testing only I can put forward my verdict so that any brother or sister can buy the same from Amazon.
BODY : OnePlus has comeup with a very durable body and stylish. Looking premium.

DISPLAY: Its a PureAmoled with 10Bit resolution with crispy HDR10 features. Vibrant natural color and screen ratio is 88.5% to body ratio. So very less bezels.

BATTERY: Easily comes for 1 and half day if not playing any games. With games 1 day. No idle midnight auto battery drain and all. 5500mAh is very slowly discharging and due to 100w charger coming inside the box the mobile charges in 17 to 18minutes only upto 85% and full 100% charging approx 19 minutes as per my test.

CAMERA: Very ok for the price. I got one update recently in May 25, 2024 and after this the camera works wonderful specially selfie and portrait mode.

PROCESSOR: Snapdragon 7Gen3 name is enough that it is very stable and fast multi tasking and even this snapdragon version not heats up fastly. The clock speed is amazingly impressive to any games like PUBG or FreeFires or Asphalt. Rest all the medium games runs smoothly. No throttle. No lag and even No uncommon heating issues etc.

METWORK: Very fast 5G and even 4G also no issues. Runs smoothly without any call drop or any disturbance in voice quality. The Voice Focus mode works very nice even in the rush or crowded metro area. Last time recorded download speed was 175mbps & upload speed approx 145 to 166mbps.

STEREO SPEAKERS: This is what attracted me the most. The stereo speakers are very loud enough. And even it sync the eaarpods very quickly. OnePlus earpods are recommended for all those EQ and bass.

OVERALL VERDICT: Very lightest mobile inspite of 5500 mAh battery. Too premium boxy design. Call and network speed very impressive. After investing on this phone I have not regretted. Highly recommended and Value for money. Thanks Seller and Amazon. 100w charger in the box. Backcase and screen guard all in the box. A complete midrange killer phone. Highly valuable."

Phone looks nice and has a good display. Overall it is a good phone, but few things bother me a lot. First of all, OnePlus had officially claimed it to be charged 60% in 15 minutes and 100% in 32 minutes but my phone takes 45 minutes, reaching to 99%. Also, it idly drains a lot when in night, it drains by around 12% in 9 hours. I am not a person into gaming and took phone for multimedia. I am liking the product. Camera is very good and clicks very good pics with main IMX 890 main sensor. It has 10 bit 1.5 K Amoled display and watching content on it is a treat, be it watching Netflix, Amazon Prime or YouTube. I am using OnePlus device for the first time and found it unique and very convenient to change ringing mode just with use of alert slider. The things I am bothered with are charging speed and idle 🔋 drain. As per OnePlus claim, full charge from 0 to 100% should be done in 32 minutes but it actually reaches around 68% in that time and full charge is possible only in around 45 minutes. Initially I was very excited about phone's charging speed when I started using this but it has just disappointed me every time. Also battery keeps draining even when not using the device and I also don't keep Always On Display and apply 120 Hz refresh rate. So, I cannot understand the cause behind this🔋drain issue.; Pros :
- flagship haptics( literally it's better than s23 ultra)
- very good display(see performance section for more info)
- very quick indispay fingerprint scanner.
- premium design with very thin vessels and glass back.( I know u will use backcase🫠)
- loud and clear speakers
- nice camera hardware(use gcam)
- very snappy and bloat free, add free UI
- very fast storage and ram, apps open quickly and keeps 10-12 apps(no games) in memory(talking about 8gb ram varient).
- very fast charging. 2-95 in just 28min and the device will be cool not even warm.(Need to appreciate oppo's vooc charging)

Cons :
- don't go by raw performance scores, it can't sustain it. After some time it runs same as dimensity 7200(but UI performace is still very good flagship level)
- need to set refresh rate at high, as in auto it almost never runs at 120hz
- warms up quickly hence always feels warm if you do something moderately demanding.
- mediocre battery life(only wifi moderate 6-7hrs SOT, only 5g moderate use 5-6hrs SOT, suprisingly overnight standby is very very good). Some people might get away with fast charging tho.
- never run this phone in performance mode as it will heatup and become similar to non performance mode speeds.; I have purchased this product for 20k without any card discounts in june 2024. And the entire review will be relative to that price point.

Box contents include a good quality silicone case, 80 watt charger with red colour cable, red club card( i found it to be useful though), oneplus & nord branding stickers alongwith the smartphone.

I will start with the cons first which is the battery backup, that feels slightly less, idle drain is a bit fast as well but it ain't a deal breaker. The phone heats up a bit as well in long sessions.

For everything else this smartphone is the best choice under 20k without any doubts.

It has a fantastic 1.5k, 120hz adequately bright & responsive 10 bit amoled display.

The performance is top notch considering the price as it has dimensity 9000 which is similar to 8+gen 1 and it also has very fast lpddr5 Ram and ufs 3.1 storage. No phone under 20k is even close to this beast.

The charging is pretty fast as well with the 80 watt charger, reaches about 85-90% from 1% in just 30 mins. I use it for WhatsApp, shopping apps, banking/trading apps and YouTube And the battery provides about 6.30-7.00 hrs SOT and lasts for about a day before it dies with 50% wifi and 50% 5g single sim usage. I use black theme, 60hz refresh rate, with low volume on loud speakers and have good 5g signal strength most of the time.

The stereo speakers alongwith Dolby Atmos are above average in terms of quality & loudness.

I haven't tested the cameras extensively but they seem to be above average.

The build quality is premium as well with glad build and thin bezels

The software is good too with minimum bloatware and 0 ads, its fluid and majorly bug free with a couple of useful features. You will get updates till Android 16.

Overall highly recommended.; ; The OnePlus Nord 3 Global version is a 🤌! I might say, the phone has some flagship qualities. If software updates can fix, tweak and boost the drawbacks...it will enter the flagship level.

Pros: Beautiful and bright display (outdoor viewing is magnificent vs OPPO Find X5), Blazing fast charging (the same as the OPPO Find X5 Pro), impressive chipset (same SoC as the OPPO Find N2 flip), TUV certification for memory, very capable main camera (same as Oneplus 11), official IP rating despite being 54 only, longer and on time software support updates (3 years OS & 4 years security), & not bloatware-filled (deletable).

Improvement suggestions: Longer on-screen battery life & better power efficiency (optimise software), better selfie and Ultra wide camera results, IP rating is 54 but could be better, the adaptive dynamic frame rate could be improved to reflect the claimed 40Hz or even down to 1Hz, WiFi 6E, Dual Wifi acceleration, eSim support.

Overall, I would highly recommend especially if you want a phone under 1000 USD that's arguably flagship material! 💚OnePlus Australia also includes a free clear case and charger. P.s. I came from OPPO Find X5"

The sleek design and vibrant color add to its appeal, making it a device worth considering in this competitive segment.; First impressions:
1. While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.
2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.
3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.
4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.
5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.
6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.
7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.
8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.

Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.

Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.

Update after 2+ weeks of usage:
1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.
2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.
3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.; Phone performance is very good
Gaming performance is so smooth and faster
Battery backup is larger whom I expect
But camera performance is not so good
It's like a original photo; It's an all rounder mobile with excellent battery life, very good camera, good sound quality, fast charging, great display, and no heating. Overall, it's excellent choice for low budget 5g mobile; The product is amazing and perform very well.. It is worth to purchase the item and it is upto the mark. I like it.

Here’s why I love it:

Design and Feel:
First off, it looks and feels premium. The sleek design and solid build make it feel way more expensive than it actually is. It's comfortable to hold and use, which is a big plus.

Display:
The screen is gorgeous. The AMOLED display is bright and vibrant, making everything from videos to games look fantastic. Plus, the high refresh rate makes scrolling and animations super smooth.

Performance:
Even though it has a weaker processor compared to other upper mid-range smartphones, the performance is still really good. Apps open quickly, and multitasking is a breeze. I’ve played some pretty graphics-heavy games on it, and it handles them surprisingly well.

Camera:
The camera setup is really impressive. Photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light. The extra lenses for wide-angle shots and close-ups add a lot of versatility. It’s perfect for snapping great photos on the go.

Battery Life:
Battery life is solid. It easily lasts all day with heavy use, and the fast charging is a lifesaver when you’re in a hurry. No more waiting around for your phone to charge!

Software:
HyperOs is smooth and feature-packed. It takes a bit to get used to if you’re coming from another brand, but it’s intuitive and has a lot of useful features.

Overall, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ is a fantastic choice if you want a high-quality phone without spending a fortune. It delivers great performance, a beautiful display, and a top-notch camera all at an affordable price. Definitely recommend it!

Bonus: There's no heating issue observed when doing demanding tasks!; First of all let's go with the pros
Display: the best thing I liked about this device is it's display am first time using an amoled curved display and it's soo good it's super smooth with 120hz and the colors are good too and within a week this device fall from about 6 feet and 3-4 times and there was not even a scratch it shows the victus protection does it's job well
• some of the users claim that the 120 watts is not working it's taking about 50 mins but actually if you try to charge the device out of the box it will shows that 120w quick charge but you need to go to settings>battery and switch on the boost charging then only it gives you true 120w potential in 19 mins
• I had test the device dipped in water for 15 mins and still there is no issues found so the ip68 also works good
• And i got and update from miui to xiaomi hyperos
And the ui is also super smooth without any bugs found
• and about gaming the device gives a smooth experience I played freefire in max settings in high fps and still I got about 50fps and i tried e-football ect.. And the device heats up a bit still not overheating in gaming I didn't found any shutters or lags it works smooth
Cons:
I think this stuff is a bit overpriced
The camera is not up to the mark in these price range
But still it can be fixed with a software update
And the battery drains fast I don't think it's 5000 mah my 5 yrs old vivo gives more backup than this but still 120w just full in 19 mins
And the other features are good about these device the cons can be just fixed by an update and after all i love these phone don't mind the negative comments just go for it and i have a suggestion it's bit over priced so you can buy it on offer times and it's not an performance oriented device if you are a gamer or looking that types of phne you can go for iqoo neo 9 Or something and that's all about these device I think this review may help you and i I'll update if I faced any prblms thank you😊; I am using REDMI NOTE 13 PRO+ since last one month. Totally satisfied with the performance of the device. Display is very good and smooth. 100W Fast charging is excellent. Battery life is very good. Both the camera front and rare is beautiful. It gives some great picture even at low light. This is the most value for money phone available in the market.; When I opened my box, it has some query but no one is taking responsibility to resolve or replace it . It has battery drain issue and again camera is not at all good. Redmi note 9 has batter camera than this phone; Heating in nirmal usage, Fast charging not working while using the phone this is very irritating thing, Laging if it is using 120 refresh rate. Not smooth. Display is good. Camera is good but not extra ordinary performance. Weight is also heavy. I dont recommend.; A very good phone camera is very smooth In 60fps .. night shoot is not good this is day camera . Charging very fast within 25 min battery full; Superb phone in this budget; Sometimes there is a lag issue and battery is kinda bad .Remaining else all good; منتج سييييئ جدا ولا يعمل وقد طلبت ارجاعه واسترداد المبلغ ولم اعهد ذلك من سوق ضخم كأمزون لتني اثق بمبيعاته ولكن صدمت هذه المرة"

Its a clear equivalent of Redmi 12 5G except NFC. I saw many users write about it having ads and bloatware, issues with battery drain, etc. As soon as it was put on the network, it downloaded Xiaomi HyperOS1.0.1.0 UMWINXM, ANDROID 14. The update was 4.4GB, took some time but the OS is as smooth as MIUI 14/ Android 13.
Battery drain can be simply reduced by using the Battery saver mode. Further, you require to fine tune on background apps and disable ads, remove recommendations to reduce irritation. Camera is decent. Processor performance is good, no lagging. However, the famous quickball has been removed. For those interested to still want it on the device, the apk has to be installed additionally. For me, I like that wonderful feature as it was a life saver in older Poco/ Redmi/ Mi phones when the Menu/ Home/ Back navigation panel failed. With Quickball, my Redmi 3s is still working perfectly since last 7.5+ years. So, I did load the quickball version 15.0.1.0.1 and being tested.

POCO phones are always the beta for 'go to market' followed by the equivalent redmi versions. I have been using POCO (F1, C3, M3) user for many years, are truely worth the money, good hardware.
Many came with a 6000mAh battery but this one has 5000mAh battery (Hence ****). The charger is fast (22.5W) but I prefer to slow charge the battery at night with a 5V/ 0.7A or 1A charger to improve the battery life, reduce the risk of battery bulging. Due to no heat-up (Li-ion does not like heat, hence slow charging is safest), battery remains safe and long lasting. The box came with its own transparent back-cover but I prefer a thicker back cover.
Has a single Loudspeaker, hence lower audio volume (Hence ****). The protective film also had a small bubble (Hence ****). But the Screen is bright, even 30% is good for normal use.
The most important feature of Xiaomi is the backup and restore, making the new phone have the exact look of your old Xiaomi phone in less than 5 minutes, some apps may not get backed-up.
Finally, Amazon delivery was on time. Its just 4 days of testing and as of know I am satisfied.

Update after a week of use- Though the download speed is good, the phone does not show 5G (JIO SIM) on its display (it shows 4G+). This is an important part to resolve, probably a patch may be necessary if at all this is a bug, since the service provider detects it as a 5G phone but the phone itself shows 4G+. Requesting Xiaomi to validate my finding and close this accordingly.
When the same SIM is put in another phone (Samsung/ IPhone), it shows 5G clearly. So this is an issue to be resolved by XIAOMI to prove that it is genuinely a 5G phone.
No heating issue noticed after a week of use now.

UPDATE 2:
We can force the network setting to 5G through developer options as 'NR' in Set preferred network type. But the battery drains drastically, hence avoid that. So the phone is obviously 5G when network setting is forced. Obviously all may not want to touch developer mode, so best to leave it as 5G/LTE in normal network settings. If XIAOMI patches to augment the setting as NR only in addition to common settings, it can show up 5G on the display, but at the cost of high battery consumption.

UPDATE 3 (16 April 2024):
The legendary Xiaomi Quickball (apk version 15.0.1.0.1) has been tested and found to be working satisfactorily. Post hardening of HyperOS, the phone is almost AD free. Google loaded its own 'Messages' apk which will take control of the inbuilt default 'Messaging' app I have kept the Messaging app as default for messages as I dont want to use messages app of google for privacy control. Battery being 5000mAH, is found to be lasting for 2 days with mobile data 'ON'. A 6000mAH battery would have been better as found on many earlier POCO phones. Quality of hardware is very good and performing. With the new HyperOS 1.0.2.0 loaded, 2 years of formal updates makes it a an economical phone with good features. Reminding all that ads-free performance can only be achieved after hardening through developer mode. I havent used memory boost function, I dont think I will require it with a 8GB (uses LPDDR5) memory. Only if needed, I will configure it. I have also installed a 128 GB memory card, which virtually reduces internal memory usage.

UPDATE 4 (18 April 2024):
A bug is identified on HyperOS. When Wifi calling is ON and Wifi is connected with a stable network, outgoing calls cannot be made. Incoming calls also do not get through. I have tested this multiple times. Xiaomi has to immediately act and fix this bug. Upon putting WiFi calling OFF, the phone resumes normally. This problem did not exist on earlier MIUI used by me.

Except this new bug identified and therefore stopping Wifi calling (actually stopping wifi calling has improved the battery life, so I dont mind not having this feature as JIO network does not have issues in our area and around), POCO M6 Pro 5G is a decent value for money. Most positives, smaller negatives for a phone in 11-12k range. Surely, Xiaomi should action it with a patch immediately.

UPDATE 5.. Only for MIUI phone users, wont work for other phones (18 May 2024):
When POCO M6 Pro is fully configured, take its backup using Additional Settings--> Backup and restore. A backup file is generated in MIUI folder under AllBackup--> Backups--> Filename with backup date. Simply copy that file and move it to your old Mi/ Redmi/ POCO phone (min. Android 10) in exacly the same folder. Then restore that file. While it will replicate the phone, you will get the benefit of the new look Control Centre. The old MIUI Control Centre will be replaced by the new HyperOS Control Centre with no change to Android Version or security patch. I liked this look and have retained the new HyperOS Control Center in my old POCO C3, which is a backup of the new phone (in case of exercising Disaster Recovery option). Its like the old Car in a new shell. Havent had any issue on that since last 15 days of using the HyperOS Control Centre in the old POCO C3. Others can enjoy too.

Overall verdict
Performance & budget friendly 5g quality smartphone that can last 5 years is this phone.

Camera lovers , fast charging & wireless charging feature lovers should definitely stay away.

Best buy in this price segment. Future ready & durable. Very good build quality & touch screen display is very good at this price point .

Instead of wasting 7 to 8 k on average phone brands with bad configuration.better to go for a good one like poco by redmi.; Used 6 months. It is Good at this price point. Go for 8/256. Its an average phone for basic uses and storage.

* Slow charging and Battery doesn't last for a day.
* Decent Camera, definitely not for vloging or high-quality photography. good for memory capturing or important record/doc capturing...
* Good Screen resolution.
* NO heating so far.
* great processor, No lagging till date.; I bought this phone for my mom. I will try to keep this review short for potential buyers.

Pros
1. Display is decent. Not HD but decent.
2. Camera is nice. Even the night vision pics are fairly clear.
3. 5G connection is smooth.
4. Battery performance is quite good.

Cons
1. Lags a bit on heavy usage.
2. Feels slightly heavy as a device.
3. Back glass cover is a finger magnet. And you have to be careful with it, cause I see potential for cracks.
4. Doesn't offer higher resolution for videos on Yotube.

I purchased it under an offer, & received extra discount. At under 10k price it is a decent device to have.; Processor
is good at this price range, BGMI performance is decent with medium setting.

Display
is bigger but I'm disappointed with its brightness. Company claims 1300 nits but I don't think it is more than 800 nits.

Battery
Is very average, 30 mins of gaming and nearly 15% battery drops. The company claims it to be 5000 mah, but I'm sure it is not more than 4000 mah. It drops very quickly.

Charging
is pretty good and faster. 30 mins of charging gives 30% battery life. But due to very low battery quality, you might need to charge it twice a day.

The phone is lighter than majority of phones, and look wise it is more attractive.

Camera
Is the best part I liked the most. Any other phones don't have such camera quality at this price segment.

Ram Rom performance is v.good and storage of 128gb is enough. With 6 gb Ram. This phone is ditto copy of Redmi 12, but that is at ₹12500, only difference is the branding. I suggest you to buy this one Poco m6 pro, which is way cheaper.

Sound Quality is decent at this price.
Rest all the features performs really well and I bought this at a discount @ ₹9999.
I'm happy with this product for the price I paid.

If you can afford ₹3000 than this range, then definitely go for some other options, because poco has boasted this product a lot. It is 20% less than what is claims.; I am using this phone from past 15 days. Its a good device according to its price. Only issue is its battery. Battery backup is not good and even the charging time is long. Othervise performance is good, build of the phone is also good. Overall a good phone at this price range; Pros; big and handfriendly display,beautifully built,affordable,android14.cons ; feeble and hardly audible sound from cheap bottom firing single speaker,very bad rear cameras,selfie camera is OK,I will not recommend to buy,battery is draining fast eventhough chip is 4nm"

Curved 1.5K Display: The curved 1.5K display is stunning. Colors are vibrant, and the viewing experience is immersive. Watching videos and playing games on this screen is a real treat.

Battery Backup: The battery backup is fantastic. I can easily get through a full day of heavy use without worrying about running out of juice.Performance: Performance-wise, the GT 6T is a beast. Apps open quickly, multitasking is smooth, and I haven't experienced any lag or stutter, even with demanding games.

Charging Speed: This is where the phone falls a bit short. The company claims it charges from 0 to 50% in 10 minutes, but in my experience, it takes about 20 minutes. While it's not a dealbreaker, it does fall short of expectations.

Camera: The camera is good. Photos are clear and detailed, and the camera app offers a lot of features and modes to play with. It's perfect for capturing those special moments.

System UI Optimization: The system UI is well-optimized. It's user-friendly, responsive, and packed with useful features without being overwhelming.

Overall, the GT 6T is a great phone with a few minor drawbacks. If the charging speed was as fast as advertised, it would be nearly perfect. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a powerful and visually stunning smartphone.; The Realme GT 6T stands out as a formidable competitor in the mid-range smartphone market, offering an impressive blend of performance, design, and value. Here’s a comprehensive look at why this phone deserves your attention:

Design and Build Quality
The Realme GT 6T features a sleek and modern design with premium materials that give it a high-end feel. The device is slim, lightweight, and ergonomically designed, making it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods. The vibrant color options and glossy finish add a touch of sophistication.

Display
The 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display is one of the highlights of the Realme GT 6T. With a resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels, it delivers sharp, vivid, and colorful visuals. The 120Hz refresh rate ensures smooth scrolling and an excellent gaming experience. The display also supports HDR10+, making it ideal for watching high-definition content.

Performance
Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, the Realme GT 6T offers top-notch performance. Whether you are multitasking, gaming, or running demanding applications, the device handles everything with ease. Coupled with up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, it ensures a lag-free and responsive experience.

Camera
The camera setup on the Realme GT 6T is impressive. The 64MP main sensor captures stunning photos with excellent detail and vibrant colors. The 16MP ultra-wide-angle lens is perfect for landscape shots, and the 8MP macro lens allows for detailed close-ups. The 32MP front camera delivers clear and attractive selfies, enhanced by various AI beautification features.

Battery Life
With a 5000mAh battery, the Realme GT 6T offers exceptional battery life. It easily lasts a full day on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The 65W SuperDart fast charging technology is a game-changer, allowing the phone to charge from 0% to 100% in just under an hour.

Conclusion
The Realme GT 6T is a stellar smartphone that offers a flagship experience at a mid-range price. Its combination of a stunning display, powerful performance, versatile camera system, and long-lasting battery makes it a great choice for anyone looking to upgrade their mobile device. Realme has once again delivered a device that punches well above its weight, making the GT 6T a highly recommended option.; I am quite impressed with this phone overall. The screen is fabulous and the processor is decent for the price point. You can significantly reduce bloatware by disabling unnecessary apps and services, which makes the phone feel very smooth during everyday use.I played Call of Duty: Warzone on it, and the game performs well for the most part. The phone charges super fast, and the battery backup is good, though not quite as exceptional as advertised. The screen brightness is sufficient even in direct sunlight, which is a big plus.However, I do have one complaint. The LTPO panel, which is supposed to lower the refresh rate to 1Hz when the screen is displaying static content, doesn't seem to work properly in my case. Despite trying it at full brightness, the refresh rate stays at 60Hz.; Been using GT Master Edition since I got it back in the day with it's OS updates coming to a standstill I was looking for a new device and long behold Realme brought this thing at the right time.
Being a performance focused phone there is no lag and the device is obviously super fast and responsive, battery life is easily an A+ with the 5500 mah battery paired with the LTPO display. The cameras felt a bit lacking but that's pretty common in this price point as well as for these performance oriented phones, still the shooters are pretty decent and photos come out quite nice.
The sound can feel a bit lacking at times but at others the stereo speakers definitely come through, maybe an issue with the media.
The phone is quite hefty and on the wider side being a bit hard to use single handedly. While there are only 9 supported bands for 5g personally didn't face any issues with connectivity for Jio and Airtel 5g which I use.; As a realme GT series fan ( my last mobile was GT Neo 2 ) this is tenfold upgrade for me in terms of form factor & durability.
First when holding this you can't feel heaviness, weight distribution is done properly. Screen is top notch, when compared it with a mi Amoled screen this panel seems like IMAX quality screen. And sound quality wise dual stereo speakers gave perfect enjoyable output.
Software is fluid, no lag is faced in doing heavy work. Build quality is where realme outshined it's predecessors and competitors, nice build quality.
Overall it's one of the best Price to performance device from realme."

This purchase is for my mother and her's first new mobile came with defect I'm totally disappointed. And I asked to the Amazon customer care they refused to take it back and advised me to approach Mi service center. I'm from Chennai so it's pretty easy to find service centre here so i approached them very next day and they told me there's 7 days replacement so they taken my defect mobile and told me it will take 10-15 days so I'm waiting for the New mobile as of now. Already it's been 7 days i advice people who are looking for low budget mobile don't go with poco. This brand become famous for their defective products.

1. 256gb + 4gb configuration
2. Decent performance
3. Looks stunning
4. Battery backup is ok but can be optimized with update
5. Above average speaker
6. Camera in daylight or in bright environment is acceptable
7. The provided case is really good.
8. 360 degree flashlight is cool
9. Display's viewing angles and overall quality is satisfactory

Cons -
1. FEW BASIC FEATURES LIKE DOUBLE TAP TO TURN ON AND OFF SCREEN, 3 FINGER SCREENSHOT ETC ARE MISSING WHICH IS VERY ANNOYING. THESE FEATURES ARE VERY BASIC AND I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW COME ITEL REMOVED IT AND WHY?
2. LOW LIGHT CAMERA PERFORMACE IS REALLY BAD.
3. PLAYSTORE AND YOUTUBE ARE NOT PROPERLY OPTIMIZED BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU ARE JUST SCROLLING IN THEM, THE PHONE STUTTERS AND HANGS WHICH NEEDS TO BE FIXED.
4. BATTERY BACKUP AUTOMATICALLY GETS REDUCED SOMETIMES WHICH ALSO NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

ITEL TEAM REALLY NEEDS TO PROVIDE ONE UPDATE ASAP TO FIX THESE MENTIONED DRAWBACKS BECAUSE SUCH BASIC FEATURES IF ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY OR ARE MISSING THEN PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO RECOMMEND THIS DEVICE TO OTHERS WITH FULL CONFIDENCE.

IF THEY FIX THESE ISSUES, THIS DEVICE WILL LITERALLY KILL THE 6-8K BUDGET SEGMENT. PLEASE FIX THEM ASAP.

(Please note all these pros and cons are mentioned considering the killer price at which it comes); I like this is mobile, this mobile desgin is very good, camera quality is too good, back side look is very cool & fabulous, bettery performence is very good, sound quality is also very good.

Pros:
1. Very affordable
2. ROM and RAM are more than any comparable mobile of same price.
3. Screen resolution is quite good
4. Sound volume is okay though there is only one speaker at the bottom.
5. Overall build quality is good.

Cons:
1. Network connectivity is poor
2. Screen brightness is low compared to other models.
3. Has only one microphone, so cannot record in stereo.

I had applied for a return/refund for the product, but came to know that, as per their policy, it cannot be returned. They arranged for an inspection of the mobile to verify the problems at my place. An inspection agent called me up and asked me to provide the OTP which had been sent to me in my email. The email instructed me as follows - ""Please share the Job Start PIN with Service expert only after they arrive at your location. Do not share over call"". But the agent kept insisting for the PIN on call, saying that he would make sure that I get a refund. I finally gave him the OTP which was a big mistake. He made a report to Amazon that the issue had been resolved. This is a fraud being commited by these agents, I request everyone NOT TO PROVIDE PIN/OTP ON CALL. I am now stuck with a sub-standard mobile phone which I can't return for a better product. It is a shame that Amazon is happily selling these mobiles and refusing to return the product! AVOID BUYING THIS MOBILE PHONE if you can afford to spend Rs.1000 to Rs.2000 more.

Edit: After using the mobile for sometime now I feel that it is okay for light daily use like YouTube, WhatsApp, Facebook and general surfing, provided you have a strong WiFi signal. Keeping in view the affordable price of this phone, the 4GB RAM and 128GB ROM size is more than what we can desire. I have been using it for Facebook live sessions without much problems.; camera quality best, wide display , fast charging, battery backup good, touch is working smoothly, light weight, connectivity also good; Memory 256 is very good, charging to battery taking more than 3hrs.

The sleek design and vibrant color add to its appeal, making it a device worth considering in this competitive segment.; First impressions:
1. While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.
2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.
3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.
4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.
5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.
6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.
7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.
8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.

Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.

Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.

Update after 2+ weeks of usage:
1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.
2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.
3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.; Phone performance is very good
Gaming performance is so smooth and faster
Battery backup is larger whom I expect
But camera performance is not so good

3. दिन की रोशनी में फोटोग्राफी: 50MP SONY IMX890 OIS मेन कैमरे के साथ अच्छी रोशनी की स्थिति में स्पष्ट तस्वीरें कैप्चर करता है.

4. फास्ट चार्जिंग चैंपियन: 67W फास्ट चार्जिंग के साथ जल्दी से फोन को चार्ज करें और कभी भी बैटरी खत्म होने की चिंता न करें.

5. आम सुविधाएं: 3.5mm जैक के साथ अपने वायर्ड हेडफ़ोन को प्लग इन करें, और IR एमिटर का उपयोग करके स्मार्ट डिवाइस को नियंत्रित करें.

सुधार की गुंजाइश:

1. कम रोशनी में परेशानी: कम रोशनी वाले वातावरण में फोटो खराब आ सकते हैं और उनमें डिटेल की कमी हो सकती है.

2. फीचर्स की कमी: स्ट्रीमिंग के शौकीनों को Netflix जैसे प्लेटफॉर्म पर HDR सपोर्ट की कमी खलेगी.

3. फिसलने वाली ग्रिप: कुछ यूजर्स के लिए इसका डिजाइन थोड़ा ज्यादा स्मूथ लग सकता है.

4. एयर जेस्चर में सुधार की जरूरत: यह फीचर अच्छा है लेकिन लगातार परफॉर्मेंस के लिए इसे और बेहतर बनाने की जरूरत है.

निष्कर्ष:

Narzo 70 Pro 5G बजट के प्रति सजग यूजर्स के लिए एक दमदार मिड-रेंज विकल्प है जो डिस्प्ले क्वालिटी, बैटरी लाइफ और एक अनोखे टचलेस कंट्रोल फीचर को प्राथमिकता देते हैं. हालांकि, कम रोशनी में कैमरा परफॉर्मेंस और UI लैग के साथ संभावित सॉफ्टवेयर गड़बड़ी इसके कमजोर पहलू हैं, जिसे सॉफ्टवेयर अपडेट के जरिए ठीक किया जा सकता है. अगर आपके लिए एयर जेस्चर सबसे अहम फीचर है, तो यह फोन आपके लिए सबसे उपयुक्त हो सकता है. जो लोग एक किफायती दाम में अच्छा परफॉर्मेंस देने वाला फोन चाहते हैं, उनके लिए Narzo 70 Pro 5G एक आकर्षक पैकेज है.; Awesome, allrounder phone under 20k, specially display camera, performance as well as we got the 3.5 jack as well as can upgrade memory if required. Camera performance is good enough capture nice details; I have been using this phone past couple of days and here are my personal experience with the device.
Performance 4/5.
Although this is not the best performing phone is this price point but still i have not felt that because its really good and can run bgmi at smooth+extreme(that is the only game i played on this).
Software 5/5.
realme ui is known for bundling so many bloatware and ads but this phone had none of it, no hot apps and hot games and you can just disable apps like app market, game center etc. This probably might be the most smoothest smartphone is this price range, the animations and all are soo good. Haven't seen a single bug yet.
Battery 4/5.
Its pretty good, i got 6.5-7.5 hrs sot on really heavy usage like 4.5 hours gaming and on 5g network.
Camera 3/5.
I was kind of Disappointed with the camera despite having such a capable sensor(imx 890 same as one plus 11 Series). The colors are so saturated and unnatural. There is also a lot of oversharpening in the image and just ruins the details. The low light performance it pretty good and video quality is also pretty good but you dont get stabilization in 4k. I did download gcam which made things 100 times better than before.
Extras.
The speakers are really good
haptics are just okay
amazing network reception and wifi performance
Amazing software features.

Overall its a pretty good phone and I DO NOT REGRET making this purchase.; Writing after one week use. It's a good choice in this price range. Camera quality also good.."

The phone came with a travel adapter included in the box, which is a nice bonus. Let me share my experience with this device.

Performance:
The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G boasts the world's first Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 chipset, and it truly lives up to the hype. The 6GB RAM paired with the powerful processor ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance even with heavy applications and games. I haven't faced any stuttering or slowdowns, and the 5G capability provides super-fast internet connectivity.

Display:
The 120Hz refresh rate on this phone is a game-changer. Scrolling through apps and websites is incredibly smooth and fluid. The colors are vibrant, and the display quality is top-notch. Whether you're watching videos or playing games, the visual experience is simply outstanding.

Storage:
With 128GB of internal storage, there's plenty of space for all my apps, photos, and videos. Plus, if you need more storage, you can always expand it using a microSD card, which is a convenient feature.

Battery Life:
The battery life is impressive as well. Even with heavy usage, the phone manages to last through the day comfortably. The inclusion of a charger in the box is a thoughtful touch, and it supports fast charging, which ensures you can quickly top up your battery when needed.

Camera:
The camera performance is good for the price range. The 48MP main sensor captures detailed and sharp images, especially in well-lit conditions. The 5MP macro and 2MP depth sensors are decent additions, but they don't deliver exceptional results in challenging lighting situations.

Build Quality:
The phone feels sturdy and well-built in hand. The Stellar Green color variant looks stunning with its unique gradient design. The device is also relatively lightweight, making it comfortable to carry around.

Value for Money:
Considering the features and performance, I believe the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G offers incredible value for money. It competes with devices that are priced higher but delivers a comparable experience at a more affordable price point.

Overall, I highly recommend the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G to anyone in the market for a powerful and feature-packed smartphone without breaking the bank. It's a well-rounded device that won't disappoint you, especially if you appreciate a smooth display, fast performance, and 5G connectivity.; The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G has captured my attention with its blend of features, promising a solid performance in the 5G smartphone arena. Here's a comprehensive review of my experience with this device:

Pros:

Great Performance: The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G delivers on its promise of excellent performance, making multitasking, gaming, and app usage a smooth and seamless experience.

Good Battery Life: With respectable battery endurance, the device keeps up with daily demands, ensuring you stay connected and entertained throughout the day.

120Hz Display: The inclusion of a 120Hz display adds fluidity to interactions and enhances the visual experience, especially during gaming and scrolling.

Reliable Camera Performance: The camera system of the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G proves dependable, capturing moments with clarity and accuracy.

Premium Design: The device's design exudes a sense of premium craftsmanship, making it a stylish addition to your tech ensemble.

Cons:

Missing Charger in the Box: The absence of a charger in the package might be disappointing to users who expect a complete out-of-the-box experience.

Minor Lag and Software Experience: While the device's performance is commendable, some users might notice minor lags across the UI, indicating room for software optimization to enhance the overall user experience.

Lack of Night Mode in 4GB RAM Variant: Users of the 4GB RAM variant are left without the convenience of a night mode, potentially affecting low-light photography.

Limited 5G Bands: The device supports only two 5G bands, which could limit its compatibility and usability in certain regions.

Final Thoughts:

The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G stands out for its notable strengths in performance, battery life, display quality, camera capabilities, and premium design. However, it's not without its shortcomings. The absence of a charger and the software experience's minor lags might be areas of concern for some users. Additionally, the lack of a night mode in the 4GB RAM variant and the limited 5G band support could impact certain user preferences and usage scenarios.

In essence, the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G offers a commendable performance package, but its drawbacks should be considered in the context of your specific needs and priorities.; Was confused between other phones on this segment. Other ones ""looked cheap"". Her words not mine. So, ordered this. It's good. Has snapdragon, decent enough camera. Good battery. Sound quality is pretty alright. Don't know about heating yet.

If you take my advice then never purchase it.; I bought the mobile and did all the set up work. then I put it to charge for 2 hours mobile only charged for 23%. there was 7 days service center replacement so I went to MI costumer care and asked for Replacement but they denied. somehow after 2 days they agreed for replacement. After 3 days i got the replacement mobile. WHich was actually used product and it had same charging issue. After that again i faced a lot of problem with MI costumer care and at MI service center...
The twist in the story is that MI costumer care told me that on the 8th day when i went there, they told me that the product will be repaired and not replaced or refunded. I was so angry at them. I had not used the mobile for 7 hours and my 7 days replacement was over due to MI Company (China Brand) carelessness. But amazon helped me with refund.

I will never buy any chinise brand product again in my life....; I got it for my mom and it's a lovely and reliable device; Reviewing after using 1month. Look wise this phone is superb.

Display quality is good but touching issue little bit u will feel that disturbance while using keyboard but it’s not much irritating ,
I thought it’s not for gamers
Sound quality good
Finally this phone budget wise good I’m satisfied with this budget and the features
Can’t expect more enough in this budget; Good phone. 5G , Camera looks marvellous and stunning. Not Hanging. Can upgrade to 1TB memory. Easy to use. I think NOKIA is back.; After using for a day...!!
Build quality: A typical Nokia product. In hand feel is good. The back panel looks so much good. Looks awesome.
Display: It's doesn't look like a 720p display at all. The overall experience with a 90hz refresh rate is smooth and punchy. But content watching like videos on YouTube may feel little dull.
Camera: The 50mp back camera is like 50/50. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's average. I haven't tested the 2mp cameras. 8mp front camera is below average. Camera app has some cool features. Use GCam for a good result. Picture quality will be improved drastically especially the front camera.
Speaker: The single bottom firing speaker is loud and has good level of vocal details. But misses the bass. Overall average. It has a feature call boost volume which will increase the volume upto 10%. The earpiece is top quality. Wired earphone output is good. I've used Nokia earphones and quality is good. Also used Noise tws and got a decent output, no issues here.
Software: Clean Android 13 with some pre installed app which is uninstallable.
Overall a good phone in this price range. 5G bands only n28 and n78 available. Airtel 5G is working fine, don't know about Jio. Compass sensor is missing. I've also attached some shots taken with Nokia G42 5G. Charging the battery will take 1hr45mins from 20% to 100%.; Nice and handy with better connectivity, camera also fine for ameture people, satisfied .; While overall it's a good product two things are not satisfactory. 1) The speed of loading apps, running them is rather slow. 2) The camera doesn't capture very sharp pictures. The lenses used to be Zeiss but now it's one that gives blurred photos.; I got the phone yesterday. Everything is fine, no ads no blotware no extra apps, that all i want. Camera quality is also good. Picture colour is upto the mark. Pure android, no lag no hang, i have used almost 30+ apps at one. Don't get underrated with negative feedback. Charging is also good, value for money aslo you can get 5g mobile with under 10k and connectivity of 5g is aslo worthy. I am glad for having this phone."

1) It is budget friendly phone.
2) Has good battery support, if you usage are basics like surfing, social networking sites and streaming.
3) Have decent crystal sound, atleast for me.

Cons :-
1) it comes without screen protector, so you have to installed it by yourself.
2) selfie camera is 5mp which is little bit disappointing, but hope it will get upgrade after updating the software.; I'm using from 2 weeks and it works fine. It has slowed down a bit I feel. But, apart from that. Everything is nice; Battery discharges within 12 hours, sound quality is very very poor, poor signal receiver, worst product, Poor performance. phone gets hanged many times, screen display will also look blurr. I got a product which is used by someone and it is returned to seller, again seller has sold it to me.
Amazon technician is a fraud he told that this mobile can be returned or replaced it is not done. Now I want replace of this mobile; Thank you; This phone has all latest technology but E-SIM feature is not included which is more important for future generation.; This set of Redmi 13 C is bit of average type of smartphone. The front camera is tremendously low quality. The rear camera though said of 50 megapixel has no such resolution specially at night. The package box contains 10 watts small charger which is a grand cheating to the customer with this high price. This doesn't meet customer's expectations for Xiaomi.; Good for use but taking time for charging; Value for money"

Good battery back up, great look & fast charging; Verry wonderful nice phone right purchase mobile and market price also very comfortable.; this is a decent phone, but it takes too long to charge considering its price. It should come with at least 33-watt charging to keep up with the competition.
Also, while the display is okay with HD quality, it's disappointing that it's not full HD. A clearer and sharper display would make a big difference.
Overall, this has potential, but faster charging and better display quality are needed to make it worth the price."

Here’s why I love it:

Design and Feel:
First off, it looks and feels premium. The sleek design and solid build make it feel way more expensive than it actually is. It's comfortable to hold and use, which is a big plus.

Display:
The screen is gorgeous. The AMOLED display is bright and vibrant, making everything from videos to games look fantastic. Plus, the high refresh rate makes scrolling and animations super smooth.

Performance:
Even though it has a weaker processor compared to other upper mid-range smartphones, the performance is still really good. Apps open quickly, and multitasking is a breeze. I’ve played some pretty graphics-heavy games on it, and it handles them surprisingly well.

Camera:
The camera setup is really impressive. Photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light. The extra lenses for wide-angle shots and close-ups add a lot of versatility. It’s perfect for snapping great photos on the go.

Battery Life:
Battery life is solid. It easily lasts all day with heavy use, and the fast charging is a lifesaver when you’re in a hurry. No more waiting around for your phone to charge!

Software:
HyperOs is smooth and feature-packed. It takes a bit to get used to if you’re coming from another brand, but it’s intuitive and has a lot of useful features.

Overall, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ is a fantastic choice if you want a high-quality phone without spending a fortune. It delivers great performance, a beautiful display, and a top-notch camera all at an affordable price. Definitely recommend it!

Bonus: There's no heating issue observed when doing demanding tasks!; First of all let's go with the pros
Display: the best thing I liked about this device is it's display am first time using an amoled curved display and it's soo good it's super smooth with 120hz and the colors are good too and within a week this device fall from about 6 feet and 3-4 times and there was not even a scratch it shows the victus protection does it's job well
• some of the users claim that the 120 watts is not working it's taking about 50 mins but actually if you try to charge the device out of the box it will shows that 120w quick charge but you need to go to settings>battery and switch on the boost charging then only it gives you true 120w potential in 19 mins
• I had test the device dipped in water for 15 mins and still there is no issues found so the ip68 also works good
• And i got and update from miui to xiaomi hyperos
And the ui is also super smooth without any bugs found
• and about gaming the device gives a smooth experience I played freefire in max settings in high fps and still I got about 50fps and i tried e-football ect.. And the device heats up a bit still not overheating in gaming I didn't found any shutters or lags it works smooth
Cons:
I think this stuff is a bit overpriced
The camera is not up to the mark in these price range
But still it can be fixed with a software update
And the battery drains fast I don't think it's 5000 mah my 5 yrs old vivo gives more backup than this but still 120w just full in 19 mins
And the other features are good about these device the cons can be just fixed by an update and after all i love these phone don't mind the negative comments just go for it and i have a suggestion it's bit over priced so you can buy it on offer times and it's not an performance oriented device if you are a gamer or looking that types of phne you can go for iqoo neo 9 Or something and that's all about these device I think this review may help you and i I'll update if I faced any prblms thank you😊; I am using REDMI NOTE 13 PRO+ since last one month. Totally satisfied with the performance of the device. Display is very good and smooth. 100W Fast charging is excellent. Battery life is very good. Both the camera front and rare is beautiful. It gives some great picture even at low light. This is the most value for money phone available in the market.; When I opened my box, it has some query but no one is taking responsibility to resolve or replace it . It has battery drain issue and again camera is not at all good. Redmi note 9 has batter camera than this phone; Heating in nirmal usage, Fast charging not working while using the phone this is very irritating thing, Laging if it is using 120 refresh rate. Not smooth. Display is good. Camera is good but not extra ordinary performance. Weight is also heavy. I dont recommend.; A very good phone camera is very smooth In 60fps .. night shoot is not good this is day camera . Charging very fast within 25 min battery full; Superb phone in this budget; Sometimes there is a lag issue and battery is kinda bad .Remaining else all good; منتج سييييئ جدا ولا يعمل وقد طلبت ارجاعه واسترداد المبلغ ولم اعهد ذلك من سوق ضخم كأمزون لتني اثق بمبيعاته ولكن صدمت هذه المرة"

1. 256gb + 4gb configuration
2. Decent performance
3. Looks stunning
4. Battery backup is ok but can be optimized with update
5. Above average speaker
6. Camera in daylight or in bright environment is acceptable
7. The provided case is really good.
8. 360 degree flashlight is cool
9. Display's viewing angles and overall quality is satisfactory

Cons -
1. FEW BASIC FEATURES LIKE DOUBLE TAP TO TURN ON AND OFF SCREEN, 3 FINGER SCREENSHOT ETC ARE MISSING WHICH IS VERY ANNOYING. THESE FEATURES ARE VERY BASIC AND I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW COME ITEL REMOVED IT AND WHY?
2. LOW LIGHT CAMERA PERFORMACE IS REALLY BAD.
3. PLAYSTORE AND YOUTUBE ARE NOT PROPERLY OPTIMIZED BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU ARE JUST SCROLLING IN THEM, THE PHONE STUTTERS AND HANGS WHICH NEEDS TO BE FIXED.
4. BATTERY BACKUP AUTOMATICALLY GETS REDUCED SOMETIMES WHICH ALSO NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

ITEL TEAM REALLY NEEDS TO PROVIDE ONE UPDATE ASAP TO FIX THESE MENTIONED DRAWBACKS BECAUSE SUCH BASIC FEATURES IF ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY OR ARE MISSING THEN PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO RECOMMEND THIS DEVICE TO OTHERS WITH FULL CONFIDENCE.

IF THEY FIX THESE ISSUES, THIS DEVICE WILL LITERALLY KILL THE 6-8K BUDGET SEGMENT. PLEASE FIX THEM ASAP.

(Please note all these pros and cons are mentioned considering the killer price at which it comes); I like this is mobile, this mobile desgin is very good, camera quality is too good, back side look is very cool & fabulous, bettery performence is very good, sound quality is also very good. This mobile touch Working very smooth. Value of money; Overall I am not happy with the performance of this iTel A70 moble phone.

Pros:
1. Very affordable
2. ROM and RAM are more than any comparable mobile of same price.
3. Screen resolution is quite good
4. Sound volume is okay though there is only one speaker at the bottom.
5. Overall build quality is good.

Cons:
1. Network connectivity is poor
2. Screen brightness is low compared to other models.
3. Has only one microphone, so cannot record in stereo.

I had applied for a return/refund for the product, but came to know that, as per their policy, it cannot be returned. They arranged for an inspection of the mobile to verify the problems at my place. An inspection agent called me up and asked me to provide the OTP which had been sent to me in my email. The email instructed me as follows - ""Please share the Job Start PIN with Service expert only after they arrive at your location. Do not share over call"". But the agent kept insisting for the PIN on call, saying that he would make sure that I get a refund. I finally gave him the OTP which was a big mistake. He made a report to Amazon that the issue had been resolved. This is a fraud being commited by these agents, I request everyone NOT TO PROVIDE PIN/OTP ON CALL. I am now stuck with a sub-standard mobile phone which I can't return for a better product. It is a shame that Amazon is happily selling these mobiles and refusing to return the product! AVOID BUYING THIS MOBILE PHONE if you can afford to spend Rs.1000 to Rs.2000 more.

Edit: After using the mobile for sometime now I feel that it is okay for light daily use like YouTube, WhatsApp, Facebook and general surfing, provided you have a strong WiFi signal. Keeping in view the affordable price of this phone, the 4GB RAM and 128GB ROM size is more than what we can desire. I have been using it for Facebook live sessions without much problems.; camera quality best, wide display , fast charging, battery backup good, touch is working smoothly, light weight, connectivity also good; Memory 256 is very good, charging to battery taking more than 3hrs. To full, camera is not good, camera looking is very good.; Itel A70 offers an attractive and affordable price with decent battery life and a user-friendly experience, making it a solid choice for basic smartphone needs.; Product is good. Earphones is missing.; جيد; جيد; موصفات غير; i order itel phone but damage; الأمانة مافي جوال بدون سماعة"

What I love in this phone:

Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 processor never lets you down while performing heavy tasks.

Along with processor it also comes with dedicated Gaming Boost Engine that makes your gaming experience even smoother and longer without heating.

Double stereo speaker gives an awesome sound quality.

5500mah battery can easily last upto 2 days even after heavy usage. On moderate or average usage it gives you 3-4 days backup. And most important, 100 watt supervooc charger will charge it within 25 minutes, its a big adapter and weighs just like a brick.

50MP+8MP main camera setup is a functional camera setup and a 16MP selfie camera, its not gonna disappoint you but don't compare with those camera centric smartphones, this phone is heavily on performance side but still it is giving you a good camera.

Display is superb, amoled display that gives you high definition media quality.. bazzles are almost non existing and gives you a premium experience like flagship displays.

Comes with O-Haptics feedback and completely like Iphones..really loving it...

8GB RAM+8GB virtual RAM with 256GB UFS 3.1 ROM makes it superb and most importantly there are many of phones that gives you 12GB of RAM in this price range but don't look at the numbers, the biggest factor is brand and performance. Point to be noted, Its 8GB RAM is better than Realme, poco vivo or oppo 12GB RAM....

After starting the phone, you will start getting updates within a week, and will get many of new features even not described in specifications,, its a surprise for you...they are gonna give you even more features in updates that will make it a flagship killer..

Oneplus is just similar to Samsung or Apple, is better known for making premium and flagship devices, so I will not compare these brands with any other brands,,they are reliable and doing a great job in smartphone market, you can chose any one of these three brands..; Reviewing after 20days of usage.
Good performece won't say this phone is best but okay for normal usage not for gaming or super heavy user purpose. Display is decent thumbs up for it.
Camera is mediocre, battery run for whole day, good thing is it super charged with 100W charger from 20-100% in 30minute
phone is not heating as other are saying, althought it's normal for smartphone to get heated while charging so it happens with this one.
played Pubg fro 4-7hours non stop at HD settings it worked smoothly. Their is high performance mode and 120hz settings so not to worry we can turn it on for heavy usage like gaming but it will consume more battery.
Screen is is visible bright in outdoors against sunlight..
Phone will take around 20gb of storage for system.
my current occupied storage is 44gb with apps out of 128gb.
Phone UI is good not best, good thing is their is no bloaware their are some apps which we can disable easily.
with 20days of calling, gaming, heavy video watching i m satisfied with the product..no issue for now.
Even I dropped mistakenly this one it's fine with the cover nothing bad happened.
I m 1st time one plus user very happy, I also bought 1year extended warranty from official one plus website...so I have 2yrs manufacture warranty at extra Rs.599.
phone body is plastic nd fits good in big hands, small hand people will face problem holding the device.
Final suggestion yes go for it if you are normal usage watching videos, running different apps for various task, calling also decent but speaker is not too loud on call but that's acceptable.Price could have been lower around 18k or 20k something.
Bought at 24.5k.. of which 22k is price and 2.5k GST.; I usually not write ✍️ review very fast when it comes to smartphone. First I need to use it and under rigorous testing only I can put forward my verdict so that any brother or sister can buy the same from Amazon.
BODY : OnePlus has comeup with a very durable body and stylish. Looking premium.

DISPLAY: Its a PureAmoled with 10Bit resolution with crispy HDR10 features. Vibrant natural color and screen ratio is 88.5% to body ratio. So very less bezels.

BATTERY: Easily comes for 1 and half day if not playing any games. With games 1 day. No idle midnight auto battery drain and all. 5500mAh is very slowly discharging and due to 100w charger coming inside the box the mobile charges in 17 to 18minutes only upto 85% and full 100% charging approx 19 minutes as per my test.

CAMERA: Very ok for the price. I got one update recently in May 25, 2024 and after this the camera works wonderful specially selfie and portrait mode.

PROCESSOR: Snapdragon 7Gen3 name is enough that it is very stable and fast multi tasking and even this snapdragon version not heats up fastly. The clock speed is amazingly impressive to any games like PUBG or FreeFires or Asphalt. Rest all the medium games runs smoothly. No throttle. No lag and even No uncommon heating issues etc.

METWORK: Very fast 5G and even 4G also no issues. Runs smoothly without any call drop or any disturbance in voice quality. The Voice Focus mode works very nice even in the rush or crowded metro area. Last time recorded download speed was 175mbps & upload speed approx 145 to 166mbps.

STEREO SPEAKERS: This is what attracted me the most. The stereo speakers are very loud enough. And even it sync the eaarpods very quickly. OnePlus earpods are recommended for all those EQ and bass.

OVERALL VERDICT: Very lightest mobile inspite of 5500 mAh battery. Too premium boxy design. Call and network speed very impressive. After investing on this phone I have not regretted. Highly recommended and Value for money. Thanks Seller and Amazon. 100w charger in the box. Backcase and screen guard all in the box. A complete midrange killer phone. Highly valuable."

There was a negligible heating issue, but after an update, everything is running buttery smooth, but the phone always tends to be in a warmer side. Need to mention that, here in my native place, the room temperature is high.
Camera is awesome,
Performance is top notch,
Battery Backup 8.5/10
Ui experience is very very good.
Charging speed is good.
Gaming performance is the best part of this phone. BGMI smooth+90fps 2x anti aliasing.

Will update my review after some days of usage.; This is the best and fastest phone I've ever used. 120 fps really makes a huge difference. Best phone at this price range. No doubt.; Works very fast; Everything is good in this phone. Hope it will run properly for a long time like my last phone.; Paisa wasul hai.; The phone is absolutely snappy, runs games like butter. After two weeks of using i would say I am absolutely satisfied.

Except for a few issues

--> 1. The Battery drains like crazy. It's understandable that the beast of a processor is the main reason. But still, otpimization should have been done more to manage the power consumption.

--> 2 The phones heats up, especially when charging and playing games in high settings.

--> 3 The Search box pops up the moment you open menu and it has got lots of ads.

--> This phone is strictly meant for performance not for camera. Camera is crappy, However, if you install google camera it turns ok.; Best phine under 24.500 😍😍😍😍 best gaming experience; The Poco X6 Pro is worth every penny, delivering outstanding performance and remarkable value for money. Despite the higher price on Amazon, I chose it over Flipkart to avoid open box delivery. Go for it!; Celular excelente custo benefício, muito bom não trava; Carregamento com autonomia e rapidez!; Entrega rápida antes do prazo. Celular muito bom, custo beneficio excelente, eu tenho só percebido que a bateria consome mais rápido, eu vim do POCO X3 Pro direto pro X6 Pro, e somente a bateria que tem sido algo pra se adaptar. O que antes eu não levava um carregador pro trabalho agora tem sido necessário usando do mesmo jeito.; O Celular é muito bom. Rápido, câmera ótima, muito espaço e o valor justo.; O celular é ótimo, muito rápido e a câmera é top demais, excelente custo benefício!"

Mentioning the experience after using the phone for more then a week.

Display: The screen on the HONOR X9b is truly impressive. The colors are vibrant, and the display is crisp, providing a visually stunning experience for watching videos and browsing through photos and most importantly my eyes are safe. It's a visual treat that adds a whole new dimension to my smartphone experience.

Performance: Zero issues with hanging or lagging. The HONOR X9b handles multitasking seamlessly, and switching between apps is a breeze. It has proven to be a reliable companion for all my daily tasks, making every interaction smooth and efficient. Also, being a moderate gamer, I feel its a great device to handle games on high settings.

Battery Life: I'm pleasantly surprised by the battery life. With normal usage, I can easily go through a full day, and there's still some juice left at the end. It's reassuring not to worry about constantly searching for a charger – a definite plus for a busy lifestyle.

Design and Comfort: The sleek design of the HONOR X9b adds a touch of elegance, and it's comfortable to hold. The phone strikes the right balance in terms of weight. I always question myself how it comes with a 5800mAh massive battery? Making it a joy to use for extended periods without causing any discomfort.

Camera: The camera on the HONOR X9b is outstanding. It captures sharp and vivid photos. Selfies come out looking great, and the overall camera performance adds a lot to the phone's appeal.

In summary, my experience with the HONOR X9b has exceeded my expectations. From the stunning display to the reliable battery life and impressive camera performance, it's a device that offers great value. If you're considering an upgrade, the HONOR X9b is definitely worth considering – a smartphone that delivers on both style and substance. Highly recommended!; It has12MP default camera. Can adjust to 108MP camera, Photos has good details in day light and also low light but Camera UI is too Old.

UI is clean, No blot wear but today is 25.05.2024 still no Android 14 update.
Overall the battery is best. You got 1.5day battery backup.
There are better camera option in this price range.; This is the new phone with play store and Google apps.
Display is super good and no eye strain even if you use full time. For my job, I'm using full time.
UI is good as any other Huawei.
Good battery backup, no heating while charging. But charging speed is not fast for the 30 watts. Type C to 3.5mm converter and a plastic headset is on the box.
Volume is average.
Histen audio quality and sound customisation is excellent.
Front camera is good and natural color of skin, not mixing jk wall putty like oppo.
Rear camera is average because of natural color, not punchy.
Touch is butter smooth and palm rejection is excellent.
Charging is slowing when you using or using Hotspot while charging, this is for protecting battery for long life.
Call quality, calling while traveling, network reception 4G to 5G changing, all are good.
Processor is capable for any tasks and Huawei honour is master in multitasking and keeping phone without hanging.
Go for it if you want excellent display, good battery backup, long life, extra warranty, natural tone selfie, and a non cracking display during fall. On top of that, it's a different experience to use Honor.
( I used Samsung, Iqoo, realme, HTC, Asus, Redmi and felt Honor OS is better); 4 months of using this mobile phone got this from amazon itself.
1.Amazon did proper delivery no issue
2.Battery issue
The makers claim to have a bigger battery set into this phone which I feel is of no use
Battery stands only for a day which is less for such big battery
No charger is provided with the box also it has very slow charging It doesnt have fast charging W option.. Takes 2 hrs to full charge
3.brigthness is very low you can get more nits brightness under this budget.. Outdoor performance is low
4.main issue is single speaker you can't even hear if your phone is on speaker and if someone being talking loud.
5.camera videography doesn't have OIS even a 15k phone nowadays has such feature.
6.under 10 percent the mobile can't stand more than 5 mins. Even with no apps running in background.

If you have low maintenance with your phone or you can't handle your phone you frequently break your phones.. You can go for this by adjusting all other features which you can go for under this range.

Nice display, no inbuilt ads like redmi, nice camera.

Only battery could have convinced me more than anything. I knew everything before I trusted in honor and it didn't work either.; The phone is good overall,
Screen is really good, durability is on point. Camera is decent, battery life is very good.
But it hangs sometimes especially when running camera. It has happened twice or thrice in a month. Hope it gets resolved with newer updates"

Realme Narzo 7G Pro 5G: कम बजट में दमदार प्रदर्शन

अहम बातें:

1. शार्प और स्मूथ डिस्प्ले: गेमिंग और स्क्रॉलिंग के लिए एक शानदार और रिस्पॉन्सिव 120Hz डिस्प्ले का आनंद लें.

Camera performance is good enough capture nice details; I have been using this phone past couple of days and here are my personal experience with the device.
Performance 4/5.
Although this is not the best performing phone is this price point but still i have not felt that because its really good and can run bgmi at smooth+extreme(that is the only game i played on this).
Software 5/5.
realme ui is known for bundling so many bloatware and ads but this phone had none of it, no hot apps and hot games and you can just disable apps like app market, game center etc. This probably might be the most smoothest smartphone is this price range, the animations and all are soo good. Haven't seen a single bug yet.
Battery 4/5.
Its pretty good, i got 6.5-7.5 hrs sot on really heavy usage like 4.5 hours gaming and on 5g network.
Camera 3/5.
I was kind of Disappointed with the camera despite having such a capable sensor(imx 890 same as one plus 11 Series). The colors are so saturated and unnatural. There is also a lot of oversharpening in the image and just ruins the details. The low light performance it pretty good and video quality is also pretty good but you dont get stabilization in 4k. I did download gcam which made things 100 times better than before.
Extras.
The speakers are really good
haptics are just okay
amazing network reception and wifi performance
Amazing software features.

Overall its a pretty good phone and I DO NOT REGRET making this purchase.; Writing after one week use. It's a good choice in this price range. Camera quality also good.."

That's right, AI helps you communicate outside your own language while you talk on the phone. And get this, it even works on messaging.","This is an updated review :
So just moved from S20, which I had for so many years to the new S24. The phone itself is good, everything works fine.. but that's expected. Got the Golden yellow colour and thankfully it's not as flashy as shown in the photos.. this is more of a light cream colour which gives a slight golden shine when seen at particular angles. It's a very decent looking phone.

When you use it, the first thing you notice is that this phone really heats up. It's Samsungs flagship and the heating issue is not limited to just while charging it, even when you use it normally.. the back gets hot. Never faced this with the S20. I feel like am using some cheap Chinese phone...well it won't burn your ear, but yes it's hot enough for one to take note.
>>And now after a few more days of usage, the heating issue has disappeared. Even after hours of continuous use it doesn't heat up... not sure what happened.. perhaps some software update.

Second is the design. Samsung used to have it's own design team which came up with really innovative stuff.. now they are just copying the iPhone. It literally looks like a Chinese knock off, OK let's give them credit.. it looks like a cheap Korean knock off of the iPhone. Nothing wrong with that, except that if you want to copy then copy something good. Personally the flat edged design is terrible to grasp and feels rigid in the palm. The earlier curved edge ones were so much comfortable to hold. Now you have to hold on to this flat metal frame which heats up.. it's not a pleasant experience. Perhaps they made this for cold weather countries, so you get an inbuilt palm heater with your phone. A phone that keeps your hands warm while in the cold... heaven knows what the designers were thinking!
>> Well as I said before the heating issue has gone. As for the shape, I would say it's easier to handle having those flat edges.. it rests easily on the figers while typing etc.. but still you do feel the flat edges when the phone is in your pocket etc.. So the shape is a mixed bag verdict. Personally I prefer smoother edges.

The battery drains out fast aswell.. currently it's matching the drainage speed of my old Samsung. Basically you have to have a fast charger around.
>> This is the point why I actually decided to edit the review. The phone's software literally optmises battery usage. It continuously adjusts screen brightness levels.. and with time and use, it's getting better at optimising battery performance. For regular usage, with a few hrs of videos and few hrs of games.. it's pulling through the day quiet easily.

Honestly I don't know why this phone should cost so much.. for the issues it has, you should easily get a similar cheaper phone in the 20-25k range.
>> Doubt it, this phone keeps getting better with usage. Never expected or experienced that before.

Camera haven't yet used. My old S20 used to give some amazing results and have used it a lot with manual settings aswell. Wonder if the S24 will be better there.
I think I might switch back to the S20.
>> Camera still not used to potential. Basic shots are very crisp though.
The AI functions are also quiet handy. Just played around till now.. so hopefully like the other aspects will get better with time.🤞; The Samsung Galaxy S24 is a solid smartphone with a lot to offer, but there are a few areas where it falls short. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

Battery: The battery life on the S24 is decent, but not great. You can expect to get through ~5 hours on a single charge with moderate use, but standby time is poor. This means the battery drains even when you're not using the phone.

Camera: The camera system on the S24 is good, but not exceptional. It takes good photos in most lighting conditions, but it doesn't quite match up to the best camera phones on the market.

Display: The display on the S24 is excellent. It's bright, clear, and has a high refresh rate for smooth scrolling.

Heat Management: The S24 tends to heat up more than expected, even during basic tasks like browsing the web. This becomes a bigger issue when using the camera, where it can get quite hot even after short recording sessions or charging your phone.

OS: The S24 comes with Android 14 with lot of improvement, but expecting to receive an update to Android 15 at the earliest (Even Nothing 2a has received it)

Other Considerations:

Design: The S24 has a sleek and stylish design that's comfortable to hold.
Performance: The S24 is a powerful phone that can handle even the most demanding tasks (not gaming)
Software: Samsung's One UI software offers a variety of features and customization options.
Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a good phone with a lot to offer, but the battery life and heat management issues hold it back from being great. If you're looking for a phone with a great camera and excellent display, the S24 is a good option. However, if battery life and heat management are important to you, you may want to consider another phone.; This phone has everything which makes it a premium flagship device.

Feedback: Seller is good and sent me a brand new sealed pack mobile.

Samsung Galaxy S24
Pros:
1. Camera takes good photographs.
2. stereo sound quality is loud and clear.
3. seamless migration from the old device.
4. Smooth user experience of Samsung One UI.
5. Awesome AI features for search and media editing.
6. Compact form factor and premium looks.
7. All day battery back up on Adaptive display (120 htz) on moderate usage. Keeping it on 60 htz will last longer for obvious reason. I used this device during a recent trip and it gave me all day back up. I was continuosly on roaming data, used maps for long hours, took hundreds of photos and captured few short videos, used for making contactless payments, used multiple apps at the same time and much more. I had a seamless experience with no hiccups at all. With 30w charger it takes around 1hr to fully charge. Within 15mins it can charge upto 25-30% approx.

Cons:
1. I found my LG G8x Thinq has a better display quality but this is just a personal experience.
2. Phone gets warm (not hot) when multi tasking is done. So it is with most of the devices.
3. Screen size feels little smaller when you shift from a bigger screen size.
4. You have to purchase super fast charging adapter, earbuds separately which will cost you around 2-3k.; The camera is worst em all, it is so bad in night light you will regret after using it.
Its battery is also not that great and AI is utterly useless. Size of the phone is good and also screen quality is great.

Not value for money at all!"

Highly recommended!; Using this phone from last two weeks so I genuinely giving my feedback

Phone look good quality of body is too good ,charging speed is good it’s 20w speed ,durability is awesome,
Front Camera is ok ,back camera is not ok
Display quality is good but touching issue little bit u will feel that disturbance while using keyboard but it’s not much irritating ,
I thought it’s not for gamers
Sound quality good
Finally this phone budget wise good I’m satisfied with this budget and the features
Can’t expect more enough in this budget; Good phone. 5G , Camera looks marvellous and stunning. Not Hanging. Can upgrade to 1TB memory. Easy to use. I think NOKIA is back.; After using for a day...!!
Build quality: A typical Nokia product. In hand feel is good. The back panel looks so much good. Looks awesome.
Display: It's doesn't look like a 720p display at all. The overall experience with a 90hz refresh rate is smooth and punchy. But content watching like videos on YouTube may feel little dull.
Camera: The 50mp back camera is like 50/50. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's average. I haven't tested the 2mp cameras. 8mp front camera is below average. Camera app has some cool features. Use GCam for a good result. Picture quality will be improved drastically especially the front camera.
Speaker: The single bottom firing speaker is loud and has good level of vocal details. But misses the bass. Overall average. It has a feature call boost volume which will increase the volume upto 10%. The earpiece is top quality. Wired earphone output is good. I've used Nokia earphones and quality is good. Also used Noise tws and got a decent output, no issues here.
Software: Clean Android 13 with some pre installed app which is uninstallable.
Overall a good phone in this price range. 5G bands only n28 and n78 available. Airtel 5G is working fine, don't know about Jio. Compass sensor is missing. I've also attached some shots taken with Nokia G42 5G. Charging the battery will take 1hr45mins from 20% to 100%.; Nice and handy with better connectivity, camera also fine for ameture people, satisfied .; While overall it's a good product two things are not satisfactory. 1) The speed of loading apps, running them is rather slow. 2) The camera doesn't capture very sharp pictures. The lenses used to be Zeiss but now it's one that gives blurred photos.; I got the phone yesterday. Everything is fine, no ads no blotware no extra apps, that all i want. Camera quality is also good. Picture colour is upto the mark. Pure android, no lag no hang, i have used almost 30+ apps at one. Don't get underrated with negative feedback. Charging is also good, value for money aslo you can get 5g mobile with under 10k and connectivity of 5g is aslo worthy. I am glad for having this phone."
