Here’s why I love it:

Design and Feel:
First off, it looks and feels premium. The sleek design and solid build make it feel way more expensive than it actually is. It's comfortable to hold and use, which is a big plus.

Display:
The screen is gorgeous. The AMOLED display is bright and vibrant, making everything from videos to games look fantastic. Plus, the high refresh rate makes scrolling and animations super smooth.

Performance:
Even though it has a weaker processor compared to other upper mid-range smartphones, the performance is still really good. Apps open quickly, and multitasking is a breeze. I’ve played some pretty graphics-heavy games on it, and it handles them surprisingly well.

Camera:
The camera setup is really impressive. Photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light. The extra lenses for wide-angle shots and close-ups add a lot of versatility. It’s perfect for snapping great photos on the go.

Battery Life:
Battery life is solid. It easily lasts all day with heavy use, and the fast charging is a lifesaver when you’re in a hurry. No more waiting around for your phone to charge!

Software:
HyperOs is smooth and feature-packed. It takes a bit to get used to if you’re coming from another brand, but it’s intuitive and has a lot of useful features.

Overall, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ is a fantastic choice if you want a high-quality phone without spending a fortune. It delivers great performance, a beautiful display, and a top-notch camera all at an affordable price. Definitely recommend it!

Bonus: There's no heating issue observed when doing demanding tasks!; First of all let's go with the pros
Display: the best thing I liked about this device is it's display am first time using an amoled curved display and it's soo good it's super smooth with 120hz and the colors are good too and within a week this device fall from about 6 feet and 3-4 times and there was not even a scratch it shows the victus protection does it's job well
• some of the users claim that the 120 watts is not working it's taking about 50 mins but actually if you try to charge the device out of the box it will shows that 120w quick charge but you need to go to settings>battery and switch on the boost charging then only it gives you true 120w potential in 19 mins
• I had test the device dipped in water for 15 mins and still there is no issues found so the ip68 also works good
• And i got and update from miui to xiaomi hyperos
And the ui is also super smooth without any bugs found
• and about gaming the device gives a smooth experience I played freefire in max settings in high fps and still I got about 50fps and i tried e-football ect.. And the device heats up a bit still not overheating in gaming I didn't found any shutters or lags it works smooth
Cons:
I think this stuff is a bit overpriced
The camera is not up to the mark in these price range
But still it can be fixed with a software update
And the battery drains fast I don't think it's 5000 mah my 5 yrs old vivo gives more backup than this but still 120w just full in 19 mins
And the other features are good about these device the cons can be just fixed by an update and after all i love these phone don't mind the negative comments just go for it and i have a suggestion it's bit over priced so you can buy it on offer times and it's not an performance oriented device if you are a gamer or looking that types of phne you can go for iqoo neo 9 Or something and that's all about these device I think this review may help you and i I'll update if I faced any prblms thank you😊; I am using REDMI NOTE 13 PRO+ since last one month. Totally satisfied with the performance of the device. Display is very good and smooth. 100W Fast charging is excellent. Battery life is very good. Both the camera front and rare is beautiful. It gives some great picture even at low light. This is the most value for money phone available in the market.; When I opened my box, it has some query but no one is taking responsibility to resolve or replace it . It has battery drain issue and again camera is not at all good. Redmi note 9 has batter camera than this phone; Heating in nirmal usage, Fast charging not working while using the phone this is very irritating thing, Laging if it is using 120 refresh rate. Not smooth. Display is good. Camera is good but not extra ordinary performance. Weight is also heavy. I dont recommend.; A very good phone camera is very smooth In 60fps .. night shoot is not good this is day camera . Charging very fast within 25 min battery full; Superb phone in this budget; Sometimes there is a lag issue and battery is kinda bad .Remaining else all good; منتج سييييئ جدا ولا يعمل وقد طلبت ارجاعه واسترداد المبلغ ولم اعهد ذلك من سوق ضخم كأمزون لتني اثق بمبيعاته ولكن صدمت هذه المرة"

1. While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.
2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.
3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.
4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.
5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.
6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.
7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.
8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.

Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.

Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.

Update after 2+ weeks of usage:
1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.
2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.
3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.; Phone performance is very good
Gaming performance is so smooth and faster
Battery backup is larger whom I expect
But camera performance is not so good
It's like a original photo; It's an all rounder mobile with excellent battery life, very good camera, good sound quality, fast charging, great display, and no heating. Overall, it's excellent choice for low budget 5g mobile; The product is amazing and perform very well.. It is worth to purchase the item and it is upto the mark. I like it.
Light weight, good sound quality and smoothness while handling.; Battery backup is good, display ok, but camera not upto the mark as mentioned 50MP!!!!!!! Camera totally disappointed...back camera is ok but selfie & while video call it's not at all good.
Phone not getting heated after continuous usage.
Sound was also ok.
Appearance wise looking good.
Mobile charging faster, overall it's ok product for the amount we put.; Everyone Should Bought It when you are having budget under 20,000

I already bought this phone and planning to buy another

In hand experience fabulous

It is having LCD Display but it is crisp and clear and not getting any issue in sun light

Camera's are excellent in this price range comparing to another brand

Battery is beast when I ordered it is 39% and I used it for more than 5 hours and it got drained only by 20% beast in talking about battery life giving backup around 2 days

UI is very smooth speaker are very loud and clear

It is having only single mic but it doesn't feel like that Call Quality Is Very Good And Clear; Camera quality is ok.Battery life is awesome.Brightness is excellent for outdoor use.Smoothness is sufficient for daily use.You will become habitual of weight."

Realme Narzo 7G Pro 5G: कम बजट में दमदार प्रदर्शन

Camera performance is good enough capture nice details; I have been using this phone past couple of days and here are my personal experience with the device.
Performance 4/5.
Although this is not the best performing phone is this price point but still i have not felt that because its really good and can run bgmi at smooth+extreme(that is the only game i played on this).
Software 5/5.
realme ui is known for bundling so many bloatware and ads but this phone had none of it, no hot apps and hot games and you can just disable apps like app market, game center etc. This probably might be the most smoothest smartphone is this price range, the animations and all are soo good. Haven't seen a single bug yet.
Battery 4/5.
Its pretty good, i got 6.5-7.5 hrs sot on really heavy usage like 4.5 hours gaming and on 5g network.
Camera 3/5.
I was kind of Disappointed with the camera despite having such a capable sensor(imx 890 same as one plus 11 Series). The colors are so saturated and unnatural. There is also a lot of oversharpening in the image and just ruins the details. The low light performance it pretty good and video quality is also pretty good but you dont get stabilization in 4k. I did download gcam which made things 100 times better than before.
Extras.
The speakers are really good
haptics are just okay
amazing network reception and wifi performance

Here are the highlights:

Curved 1.5K Display: The curved 1.5K display is stunning. Colors are vibrant, and the viewing experience is immersive. Watching videos and playing games on this screen is a real treat.

Battery Backup: The battery backup is fantastic. I can easily get through a full day of heavy use without worrying about running out of juice.Performance: Performance-wise, the GT 6T is a beast. Apps open quickly, multitasking is smooth, and I haven't experienced any lag or stutter, even with demanding games.

Charging Speed: This is where the phone falls a bit short. The company claims it charges from 0 to 50% in 10 minutes, but in my experience, it takes about 20 minutes. While it's not a dealbreaker, it does fall short of expectations.

Camera: The camera is good. Photos are clear and detailed, and the camera app offers a lot of features and modes to play with. It's perfect for capturing those special moments.

System UI Optimization: The system UI is well-optimized. It's user-friendly, responsive, and packed with useful features without being overwhelming.

Overall, the GT 6T is a great phone with a few minor drawbacks. If the charging speed was as fast as advertised, it would be nearly perfect. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a powerful and visually stunning smartphone.; The Realme GT 6T stands out as a formidable competitor in the mid-range smartphone market, offering an impressive blend of performance, design, and value. Here’s a comprehensive look at why this phone deserves your attention:

Design and Build Quality
The Realme GT 6T features a sleek and modern design with premium materials that give it a high-end feel. The device is slim, lightweight, and ergonomically designed, making it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods. The vibrant color options and glossy finish add a touch of sophistication.

Display
The 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display is one of the highlights of the Realme GT 6T. With a resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels, it delivers sharp, vivid, and colorful visuals. The 120Hz refresh rate ensures smooth scrolling and an excellent gaming experience. The display also supports HDR10+, making it ideal for watching high-definition content.

Whether you are multitasking, gaming, or running demanding applications, the device handles everything with ease. Coupled with up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, it ensures a lag-free and responsive experience.

Camera
The camera setup on the Realme GT 6T is impressive. The 64MP main sensor captures stunning photos with excellent detail and vibrant colors. The 16MP ultra-wide-angle lens is perfect for landscape shots, and the 8MP macro lens allows for detailed close-ups. The 32MP front camera delivers clear and attractive selfies, enhanced by various AI beautification features.

Conclusion
The Realme GT 6T is a stellar smartphone that offers a flagship experience at a mid-range price. Its combination of a stunning display, powerful performance, versatile camera system, and long-lasting battery makes it a great choice for anyone looking to upgrade their mobile device. Realme has once again delivered a device that punches well above its weight, making the GT 6T a highly recommended option.; I am quite impressed with this phone overall. The screen is fabulous and the processor is decent for the price point. You can significantly reduce bloatware by disabling unnecessary apps and services, which makes the phone feel very smooth during everyday use.I played Call of Duty: Warzone on it, and the game performs well for the most part. The phone charges super fast, and the battery backup is good, though not quite as exceptional as advertised. The screen brightness is sufficient even in direct sunlight, which is a big plus.However, I do have one complaint. The LTPO panel, which is supposed to lower the refresh rate to 1Hz when the screen is displaying static content, doesn't seem to work properly in my case. Despite trying it at full brightness, the refresh rate stays at 60Hz.; Been using GT Master Edition since I got it back in the day with it's OS updates coming to a standstill I was looking for a new device and long behold Realme brought this thing at the right time.
Being a performance focused phone there is no lag and the device is obviously super fast and responsive, battery life is easily an A+ with the 5500 mah battery paired with the LTPO display. The cameras felt a bit lacking but that's pretty common in this price point as well as for these performance oriented phones, still the shooters are pretty decent and photos come out quite nice.
The sound can feel a bit lacking at times but at others the stereo speakers definitely come through, maybe an issue with the media.
The phone is quite hefty and on the wider side being a bit hard to use single handedly. While there are only 9 supported bands for 5g personally didn't face any issues with connectivity for Jio and Airtel 5g which I use.; As a realme GT series fan ( my last mobile was GT Neo 2 ) this is tenfold upgrade for me in terms of form factor & durability.
First when holding this you can't feel heaviness, weight distribution is done properly. Screen is top notch, when compared it with a mi Amoled screen this panel seems like IMAX quality screen. And sound quality wise dual stereo speakers gave perfect enjoyable output.
Software is fluid, no lag is faced in doing heavy work. Build quality is where realme outshined it's predecessors and competitors, nice build quality.
Overall it's one of the best Price to performance device from realme."

Highly recommended!; Using this phone from last two weeks so I genuinely giving my feedback

Phone look good quality of body is too good ,charging speed is good it’s 20w speed ,durability is awesome,
Front Camera is ok ,back camera is not ok
Display quality is good but touching issue little bit u will feel that disturbance while using keyboard but it’s not much irritating ,
I thought it’s not for gamers
Sound quality good
Finally this phone budget wise good I’m satisfied with this budget and the features
Can’t expect more enough in this budget; Good phone. 5G , Camera looks marvellous and stunning. Not Hanging. Can upgrade to 1TB memory. Easy to use. I think NOKIA is back.; After using for a day...!!
Build quality: A typical Nokia product. In hand feel is good. The back panel looks so much good. Looks awesome.
Display: It's doesn't look like a 720p display at all. The overall experience with a 90hz refresh rate is smooth and punchy. But content watching like videos on YouTube may feel little dull.
Camera: The 50mp back camera is like 50/50. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's average. I haven't tested the 2mp cameras. 8mp front camera is below average. Camera app has some cool features. Use GCam for a good result. Picture quality will be improved drastically especially the front camera.
Speaker: The single bottom firing speaker is loud and has good level of vocal details. But misses the bass. Overall average. It has a feature call boost volume which will increase the volume upto 10%. The earpiece is top quality. Wired earphone output is good. I've used Nokia earphones and quality is good. Also used Noise tws and got a decent output, no issues here.
Software: Clean Android 13 with some pre installed app which is uninstallable.
Overall a good phone in this price range. 5G bands only n28 and n78 available. Airtel 5G is working fine, don't know about Jio. Compass sensor is missing. I've also attached some shots taken with Nokia G42 5G. Charging the battery will take 1hr45mins from 20% to 100%.; Nice and handy with better connectivity, camera also fine for ameture people, satisfied .; While overall it's a good product two things are not satisfactory. 1) The speed of loading apps, running them is rather slow. 2) The camera doesn't capture very sharp pictures. The lenses used to be Zeiss but now it's one that gives blurred photos.; I got the phone yesterday. Everything is fine, no ads no blotware no extra apps, that all i want. Camera quality is also good. Picture colour is upto the mark. Pure android, no lag no hang, i have used almost 30+ apps at one. Don't get underrated with negative feedback. Charging is also good, value for money aslo you can get 5g mobile with under 10k and connectivity of 5g is aslo worthy. I am glad for having this phone."

1. 256gb + 4gb configuration
2. Decent performance
3. Looks stunning
4. Battery backup is ok but can be optimized with update
5. Above average speaker
6. Camera in daylight or in bright environment is acceptable
7. The provided case is really good.
8. 360 degree flashlight is cool
9. Display's viewing angles and overall quality is satisfactory

Cons -
1. FEW BASIC FEATURES LIKE DOUBLE TAP TO TURN ON AND OFF SCREEN, 3 FINGER SCREENSHOT ETC ARE MISSING WHICH IS VERY ANNOYING. THESE FEATURES ARE VERY BASIC AND I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW COME ITEL REMOVED IT AND WHY?
2. LOW LIGHT CAMERA PERFORMACE IS REALLY BAD.
3. PLAYSTORE AND YOUTUBE ARE NOT PROPERLY OPTIMIZED BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU ARE JUST SCROLLING IN THEM, THE PHONE STUTTERS AND HANGS WHICH NEEDS TO BE FIXED.
4. BATTERY BACKUP AUTOMATICALLY GETS REDUCED SOMETIMES WHICH ALSO NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

ITEL TEAM REALLY NEEDS TO PROVIDE ONE UPDATE ASAP TO FIX THESE MENTIONED DRAWBACKS BECAUSE SUCH BASIC FEATURES IF ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY OR ARE MISSING THEN PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO RECOMMEND THIS DEVICE TO OTHERS WITH FULL CONFIDENCE.

IF THEY FIX THESE ISSUES, THIS DEVICE WILL LITERALLY KILL THE 6-8K BUDGET SEGMENT. PLEASE FIX THEM ASAP.

(Please note all these pros and cons are mentioned considering the killer price at which it comes); I like this is mobile, this mobile desgin is very good, camera quality is too good, back side look is very cool & fabulous, bettery performence is very good, sound quality is also very good. This mobile touch Working very smooth. Value of money; Overall I am not happy with the performance of this iTel A70 moble phone.

Pros:
1. Very affordable
2. ROM and RAM are more than any comparable mobile of same price.
3. Screen resolution is quite good
4. Sound volume is okay though there is only one speaker at the bottom.
5. Overall build quality is good.

Cons:
1. Network connectivity is poor
2. Screen brightness is low compared to other models.
3. Has only one microphone, so cannot record in stereo.

I had applied for a return/refund for the product, but came to know that, as per their policy, it cannot be returned. They arranged for an inspection of the mobile to verify the problems at my place. An inspection agent called me up and asked me to provide the OTP which had been sent to me in my email. The email instructed me as follows - ""Please share the Job Start PIN with Service expert only after they arrive at your location. Do not share over call"". But the agent kept insisting for the PIN on call, saying that he would make sure that I get a refund. I finally gave him the OTP which was a big mistake. He made a report to Amazon that the issue had been resolved. This is a fraud being commited by these agents, I request everyone NOT TO PROVIDE PIN/OTP ON CALL. I am now stuck with a sub-standard mobile phone which I can't return for a better product. It is a shame that Amazon is happily selling these mobiles and refusing to return the product! AVOID BUYING THIS MOBILE PHONE if you can afford to spend Rs.1000 to Rs.2000 more.

Edit: After using the mobile for sometime now I feel that it is okay for light daily use like YouTube, WhatsApp, Facebook and general surfing, provided you have a strong WiFi signal. Keeping in view the affordable price of this phone, the 4GB RAM and 128GB ROM size is more than what we can desire. I have been using it for Facebook live sessions without much problems.; camera quality best, wide display , fast charging, battery backup good, touch is working smoothly, light weight, connectivity also good; Memory 256 is very good, charging to battery taking more than 3hrs.

1) It is budget friendly phone.
2) Has good battery support, if you usage are basics like surfing, social networking sites and streaming.
3) Have decent crystal sound, atleast for me.

Cons :-
1) it comes without screen protector, so you have to installed it by yourself.
2) selfie camera is 5mp which is little bit disappointing, but hope it will get upgrade after updating the software.; I'm using from 2 weeks and it works fine. It has slowed down a bit I feel. But, apart from that. Everything is nice; Battery discharges within 12 hours, sound quality is very very poor, poor signal receiver, worst product, Poor performance. phone gets hanged many times, screen display will also look blurr. I got a product which is used by someone and it is returned to seller, again seller has sold it to me.
Amazon technician is a fraud he told that this mobile can be returned or replaced it is not done. Now I want replace of this mobile; Thank you; This phone has all latest technology but E-SIM feature is not included which is more important for future generation.; This set of Redmi 13 C is bit of average type of smartphone. The front camera is tremendously low quality. The rear camera though said of 50 megapixel has no such resolution specially at night. The package box contains 10 watts small charger which is a grand cheating to the customer with this high price. This doesn't meet customer's expectations for Xiaomi.; Good for use but taking time for charging; Value for money"

At first I was little sceptical about how things would go at this price range. I have used Vivo Nokia and Samsung at > Lava O2 budget and to be honest I am happy with this phone
Here are the pros of this phone:
Battery- 5000 mAh is good and lasts minimum of 7 hrs on heavy use and easily lasts a day on rough use
Charging time: 0-100% in nearly 2 hrs . Great! 4/5
Sound quality: sound quality is good but it doesn't really be hearable at low volume . A slight downgrade 3/5
Screen: To be honest, this has the best screen in this range or even above . Even my friends who owned mobile phones at the range of 15,000-30,000 had praised the screen of this phone. The punch hole display is a cherry on top of the cake. I could even see the screen at outdoors without any issues. Great! 5/5
Performance: The phone has a 8+8 combination of Ram and 128 gb ROM. I have tried various high end games on this phone and it's running good. Even it shows 30-40 Fps in COD mobile, but it doesn't feel like it,means it runs very smooth 5/5
I did also play solo leveling arise, Clash of clans,clash royale ,Bgmi ,FF , Farlight and asphalt series. All ran good in this phone . Best!
Storage: Imagine I have a lot of games in this phone simultaneously. Like all the above mentioned. I even have downloaded the expansion pack of some of the games completely. Still I have 50% of storage left. Means the storage system is great! 5/5
Camera: the camera setup is of 50Mp primary sensor with another one may be of potriat ig . But the camera is great . I had some very good photos but Amazon isn't letting me upload them . It has various camera modes and a good selfie sensor. Good! 4/5

Now for the cons:
Camera : After the update I got this problem . The camera lags while taking videos or photos. But in the gallery it is good. I hope the camera is maintained good in future updates
Charging issues: Not much issues but the phone gets very hot and thanks to the glass back 🙂 it just acts like salt sprinkled on a bruise
Device: Only after update I saw this problem. Sometimes when I open the app, the app suddenly closes and also closes each and every open tabs. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible
Touch sensitivity: Sometimes when I am grinding in fps games . When I press the attack button I have to press twice first as the button itself becomes unresponsive at first only. This has happened multiple times leading into losing the match💔

Overall the phone is great . Please resolve the issues seen after update as soon as possible. Kudos!; Nice Phone,Good Bounceback by Lava,
Phone Looks Good,Light weight and Working Smooth...Overall Very Good Smartphone In this Price Range...; I have purchased this LAVA O2 mobile, but it's not reached our expectations. I should replace the mobile. The main issue was call voice is not audible. There is some issue in the mobile. Looking forward to hearing from you positive response.
Overall the mobile is not good. Please replace the mobile.; Overall nice phone with regards to its design, performance, display, sound quality and battery. Very nice made in india phone at such price.; Very good 4G phone, with smooth finish and touch. Very good build quality. Stylish design.

Likes :
1. Proudly Indian
2. Clean Android 13. No bloatware. It's stock Android.
3. Premium glass back design.
4. Ultra smooth touch screen.
5. No lags as of now.
6. Fast fingerprint sensor.
8. Big memory inthis price (8GB, 128GB).
9. It's charging very fast.

Not likes:
1. May be better images expected with 50MP. But ok in this price. Need improvement in camera app.
Update1: updated and now camera is good.

It's truly competition to other brands.
Go for LAVA. Don't let your money go out of India.

#ProudlyIndian; Battery's drained in 6-7hrs, speakers volume is very low in compare to the Vivo phone.
Looks and screen is good. camera good; I was looking for phone for my Generative AI development work where I can memory for my Apps rather bloatware using that memory. Initially when I saw it there was no review but it was mentioned 8GB RAM and bloatware free Android Experience so I picked up and this phone has surprised me.

Here are few good points.
1) Bloatware free android experience and Only google Apps and two Lava Apps along with system apps.
2) Standby time it quite impressive
3) Phone design is also quite impressive
4) There is free phone cover and Phone charger which most of other companies are not providing now a days
5) Currently I am running large language model with Ollama and llama.cpp with models like llama3, phi3, mistral, sqlcoder, starcoder, gemma:2b, qwen and all other models ranging from 900 mb to 4.7gb size.
6) python, nodejs, open source web apps also working quite fast.

Considering All above in 7999 INR after coupon is great deal not only for user but also for developer, I expect LAVA to bring bloatware free experience with 16 and 32GB with 512/1TB internal memory in future at competitive price so that we can keep running bigger technology in Android mobile.

Thank you LAVA.; Lava O2 is the most fastest and amazing phone under 8k. I bought it for 7,499 in sale. It's performance has not disappointed me for once. Alltho am giving 4 stars because phone has heating issues. I've been using it for a few days so here's my opinion on the topics :-

• Battery life : Average for a 8k Phone can easily give a 6hr run time while playing games.
• Quality : Build Quality is 10/10. Phone gives an expensive look. Overall good.
• Camera : Average, back camera can be improved.
• Sound Quality : Sound quality is good too and speakers are fine as well.
• Gaming : Light gaming can be done but playing heavy games like BGMI and COD can cause heating. For normal gaming like roblox, Subway surfer, etc. . It's good.
• Heating : The phone heats up quite fast. It's heating the most while charging.
• Easy to use : It's actually smooth and it's ram is also good which gives a smooth experience.
• RAM and ROM : Compared to other companies, lava gives more ROM and it's 8gb ram is also very efficient. Expandable Ram hasn't been in much use but it's smooth.

You can't expect a 8k Phone to compete iPhone or other expensive phones. It's the best one in the segment. Go for it, it's Indian and efficient."

Here’s why this advanced smartphone has won me over:

One of the first things I noticed about the Samsung M34 is its sleek and slim design. The slightly smaller size compared to the M33 makes it incredibly comfortable to hold and use, without compromising on functionality. The refined aesthetics give it a modern and premium look that I truly appreciate.

The battery backup is impressive and has consistently kept up with my daily usage. Whether I’m browsing, streaming, or using apps, the battery life has proven to be reliable, reducing the need for frequent charging.

In terms of performance, the Samsung M34 excels in speed for basic tasks. Navigating through apps, multitasking, and general usage are smooth and responsive, enhancing the overall user experience. It’s a noticeable upgrade from the M33, making everyday activities more efficient and enjoyable.

The display quality is another highlight of the Samsung M34. The vibrant colors, sharpness, and clarity of the screen make media consumption a pleasure. Watching videos, viewing photos, and even reading text is a visually satisfying experience on this device.; Hello!!
this is Sourya Gourab,
today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......
👉... PROS ...👈
▪️1) CAMERA:- the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .👍
▪️ 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....👍 but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...🤔 honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.
▪️3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thing🔥🥰. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure Folder📁 etc. Samsung Knox🔒 is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung 😍😍😍
▪️4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot 🔥 Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue 😊😊it's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.
👉 Yes!! sometimes it feels warm🔥 in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad 😊. ₹14999/- is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......👍👍👍
▪️5) BATTERY🔋:- 6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.
But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.👍 prevent background running of apps etc.....
❗️❗️👉... CON'S ...👈❗️❗️
▪️6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high📈. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damages😅 in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!! KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2:) Phone has slightly warm🌡 issue on its back side....also Slightly Heat🔥 during charging.....😐 but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG 😇😇😇
SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....
I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ❤️. Regards

(AMAZON PRIME COSTUMER); Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)

M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..

Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)

A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..

Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.

After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!
Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)

I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..

Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..

Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..

M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gb

M30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not required

Jio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..

5g is perceptibly fast..

Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank card

Overall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile; Produit arrivé en temp et en heure. Parfait à l'utilisation. Juste un bémol. Le poid.; Produit conforme à mes attentes
Facile à utiliser et Fonctionnel; El producto ha salido defectuoso no carga ni enciende me gustaría devolverlo. NI un mes con el móvil y ya está roto.; Peccato perché era un bel telefono con una gran batteria..dopo l aggiornamento, l app di gestione del telefono continuava a crashare rendendo il telefono inutilizzabile..
Restituito subito; Pur pagando una cifra modesta l'M34 mi ha sorpreso per la sua duttilità e le fotografie ottomr. Perfetta la cover custodia e il caricatore eccezionale ricarica l'M34 in soli 10 minuti. Do volentieri le 5 stelle."

Good battery back up, great look & fast charging; Verry wonderful nice phone right purchase mobile and market price also very comfortable.; this is a decent phone, but it takes too long to charge considering its price. It should come with at least 33-watt charging to keep up with the competition.
Also, while the display is okay with HD quality, it's disappointing that it's not full HD. A clearer and sharper display would make a big difference.
Overall, this has potential, but faster charging and better display quality are needed to make it worth the price."

Highly recommended!; Using this phone from last two weeks so I genuinely giving my feedback

Phone look good quality of body is too good ,charging speed is good it’s 20w speed ,durability is awesome,
Front Camera is ok ,back camera is not ok
Display quality is good but touching issue little bit u will feel that disturbance while using keyboard but it’s not much irritating ,
I thought it’s not for gamers
Sound quality good
Finally this phone budget wise good I’m satisfied with this budget and the features
Can’t expect more enough in this budget; Good phone. 5G , Camera looks marvellous and stunning. Not Hanging. Can upgrade to 1TB memory. Easy to use. I think NOKIA is back.; After using for a day...!!
Build quality: A typical Nokia product. In hand feel is good. The back panel looks so much good. Looks awesome.
Display: It's doesn't look like a 720p display at all. The overall experience with a 90hz refresh rate is smooth and punchy. But content watching like videos on YouTube may feel little dull.
Camera: The 50mp back camera is like 50/50. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's average. I haven't tested the 2mp cameras. 8mp front camera is below average. Camera app has some cool features. Use GCam for a good result. Picture quality will be improved drastically especially the front camera.
Speaker: The single bottom firing speaker is loud and has good level of vocal details. But misses the bass. Overall average. It has a feature call boost volume which will increase the volume upto 10%. The earpiece is top quality. Wired earphone output is good. I've used Nokia earphones and quality is good. Also used Noise tws and got a decent output, no issues here.
Software: Clean Android 13 with some pre installed app which is uninstallable.
Overall a good phone in this price range. 5G bands only n28 and n78 available. Airtel 5G is working fine, don't know about Jio. Compass sensor is missing. I've also attached some shots taken with Nokia G42 5G. Charging the battery will take 1hr45mins from 20% to 100%.; Nice and handy with better connectivity, camera also fine for ameture people, satisfied .; While overall it's a good product two things are not satisfactory. 1) The speed of loading apps, running them is rather slow. 2) The camera doesn't capture very sharp pictures. The lenses used to be Zeiss but now it's one that gives blurred photos.; I got the phone yesterday. Everything is fine, no ads no blotware no extra apps, that all i want. Camera quality is also good. Picture colour is upto the mark. Pure android, no lag no hang, i have used almost 30+ apps at one. Don't get underrated with negative feedback. Charging is also good, value for money aslo you can get 5g mobile with under 10k and connectivity of 5g is aslo worthy. I am glad for having this phone."

Here’s why I love it:

Design and Feel:
First off, it looks and feels premium. The sleek design and solid build make it feel way more expensive than it actually is. It's comfortable to hold and use, which is a big plus.

Display:
The screen is gorgeous. The AMOLED display is bright and vibrant, making everything from videos to games look fantastic. Plus, the high refresh rate makes scrolling and animations super smooth.

Performance:
Even though it has a weaker processor compared to other upper mid-range smartphones, the performance is still really good. Apps open quickly, and multitasking is a breeze. I’ve played some pretty graphics-heavy games on it, and it handles them surprisingly well.

Camera:
The camera setup is really impressive. Photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light. The extra lenses for wide-angle shots and close-ups add a lot of versatility. It’s perfect for snapping great photos on the go.

Battery Life:
Battery life is solid. It easily lasts all day with heavy use, and the fast charging is a lifesaver when you’re in a hurry. No more waiting around for your phone to charge!

Software:
HyperOs is smooth and feature-packed. It takes a bit to get used to if you’re coming from another brand, but it’s intuitive and has a lot of useful features.

Overall, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ is a fantastic choice if you want a high-quality phone without spending a fortune. It delivers great performance, a beautiful display, and a top-notch camera all at an affordable price. Definitely recommend it!

Bonus: There's no heating issue observed when doing demanding tasks!; First of all let's go with the pros
Display: the best thing I liked about this device is it's display am first time using an amoled curved display and it's soo good it's super smooth with 120hz and the colors are good too and within a week this device fall from about 6 feet and 3-4 times and there was not even a scratch it shows the victus protection does it's job well
• some of the users claim that the 120 watts is not working it's taking about 50 mins but actually if you try to charge the device out of the box it will shows that 120w quick charge but you need to go to settings>battery and switch on the boost charging then only it gives you true 120w potential in 19 mins
• I had test the device dipped in water for 15 mins and still there is no issues found so the ip68 also works good
• And i got and update from miui to xiaomi hyperos
And the ui is also super smooth without any bugs found
• and about gaming the device gives a smooth experience I played freefire in max settings in high fps and still I got about 50fps and i tried e-football ect.. And the device heats up a bit still not overheating in gaming I didn't found any shutters or lags it works smooth
Cons:
I think this stuff is a bit overpriced
The camera is not up to the mark in these price range
But still it can be fixed with a software update
And the battery drains fast I don't think it's 5000 mah my 5 yrs old vivo gives more backup than this but still 120w just full in 19 mins
And the other features are good about these device the cons can be just fixed by an update and after all i love these phone don't mind the negative comments just go for it and i have a suggestion it's bit over priced so you can buy it on offer times and it's not an performance oriented device if you are a gamer or looking that types of phne you can go for iqoo neo 9 Or something and that's all about these device I think this review may help you and i I'll update if I faced any prblms thank you😊; I am using REDMI NOTE 13 PRO+ since last one month. Totally satisfied with the performance of the device. Display is very good and smooth. 100W Fast charging is excellent. Battery life is very good. Both the camera front and rare is beautiful. It gives some great picture even at low light. This is the most value for money phone available in the market.; When I opened my box, it has some query but no one is taking responsibility to resolve or replace it . It has battery drain issue and again camera is not at all good. Redmi note 9 has batter camera than this phone; Heating in nirmal usage, Fast charging not working while using the phone this is very irritating thing, Laging if it is using 120 refresh rate. Not smooth. Display is good. Camera is good but not extra ordinary performance. Weight is also heavy. I dont recommend.; A very good phone camera is very smooth In 60fps .. night shoot is not good this is day camera . Charging very fast within 25 min battery full; Superb phone in this budget; Sometimes there is a lag issue and battery is kinda bad .Remaining else all good; منتج سييييئ جدا ولا يعمل وقد طلبت ارجاعه واسترداد المبلغ ولم اعهد ذلك من سوق ضخم كأمزون لتني اثق بمبيعاته ولكن صدمت هذه المرة"

That's right, AI helps you communicate outside your own language while you talk on the phone. And get this, it even works on messaging.","This is an updated review :
So just moved from S20, which I had for so many years to the new S24. The phone itself is good, everything works fine.. but that's expected. Got the Golden yellow colour and thankfully it's not as flashy as shown in the photos.. this is more of a light cream colour which gives a slight golden shine when seen at particular angles. It's a very decent looking phone.

When you use it, the first thing you notice is that this phone really heats up. It's Samsungs flagship and the heating issue is not limited to just while charging it, even when you use it normally.. the back gets hot. Never faced this with the S20. I feel like am using some cheap Chinese phone...well it won't burn your ear, but yes it's hot enough for one to take note.
>>And now after a few more days of usage, the heating issue has disappeared. Even after hours of continuous use it doesn't heat up... not sure what happened.. perhaps some software update.

Second is the design. Samsung used to have it's own design team which came up with really innovative stuff.. now they are just copying the iPhone. It literally looks like a Chinese knock off, OK let's give them credit.. it looks like a cheap Korean knock off of the iPhone. Nothing wrong with that, except that if you want to copy then copy something good. Personally the flat edged design is terrible to grasp and feels rigid in the palm. The earlier curved edge ones were so much comfortable to hold. Now you have to hold on to this flat metal frame which heats up.. it's not a pleasant experience. Perhaps they made this for cold weather countries, so you get an inbuilt palm heater with your phone. A phone that keeps your hands warm while in the cold... heaven knows what the designers were thinking!
>> Well as I said before the heating issue has gone. As for the shape, I would say it's easier to handle having those flat edges.. it rests easily on the figers while typing etc.. but still you do feel the flat edges when the phone is in your pocket etc.. So the shape is a mixed bag verdict. Personally I prefer smoother edges.

The battery drains out fast aswell.. currently it's matching the drainage speed of my old Samsung. Basically you have to have a fast charger around.
>> This is the point why I actually decided to edit the review. The phone's software literally optmises battery usage. It continuously adjusts screen brightness levels.. and with time and use, it's getting better at optimising battery performance. For regular usage, with a few hrs of videos and few hrs of games.. it's pulling through the day quiet easily.

Honestly I don't know why this phone should cost so much.. for the issues it has, you should easily get a similar cheaper phone in the 20-25k range.
>> Doubt it, this phone keeps getting better with usage. Never expected or experienced that before.

Camera haven't yet used. My old S20 used to give some amazing results and have used it a lot with manual settings aswell. Wonder if the S24 will be better there.
I think I might switch back to the S20.
>> Camera still not used to potential. Basic shots are very crisp though.
The AI functions are also quiet handy. Just played around till now.. so hopefully like the other aspects will get better with time.🤞; The Samsung Galaxy S24 is a solid smartphone with a lot to offer, but there are a few areas where it falls short. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

Battery: The battery life on the S24 is decent, but not great. You can expect to get through ~5 hours on a single charge with moderate use, but standby time is poor. This means the battery drains even when you're not using the phone.

Camera: The camera system on the S24 is good, but not exceptional. It takes good photos in most lighting conditions, but it doesn't quite match up to the best camera phones on the market.

Display: The display on the S24 is excellent. It's bright, clear, and has a high refresh rate for smooth scrolling.

Heat Management: The S24 tends to heat up more than expected, even during basic tasks like browsing the web. This becomes a bigger issue when using the camera, where it can get quite hot even after short recording sessions or charging your phone.

OS: The S24 comes with Android 14 with lot of improvement, but expecting to receive an update to Android 15 at the earliest (Even Nothing 2a has received it)

Other Considerations:

Design: The S24 has a sleek and stylish design that's comfortable to hold.
Performance: The S24 is a powerful phone that can handle even the most demanding tasks (not gaming)
Software: Samsung's One UI software offers a variety of features and customization options.
Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a good phone with a lot to offer, but the battery life and heat management issues hold it back from being great. If you're looking for a phone with a great camera and excellent display, the S24 is a good option. However, if battery life and heat management are important to you, you may want to consider another phone.; This phone has everything which makes it a premium flagship device.

Seller: INDIAN LIBERTY
Feedback: Seller is good and sent me a brand new sealed pack mobile.

Samsung Galaxy S24
Pros:
1. Camera takes good photographs.
2. stereo sound quality is loud and clear.
3. seamless migration from the old device.
4. Smooth user experience of Samsung One UI.
5. Awesome AI features for search and media editing.
6. Compact form factor and premium looks.
7. All day battery back up on Adaptive display (120 htz) on moderate usage. Keeping it on 60 htz will last longer for obvious reason. I used this device during a recent trip and it gave me all day back up. I was continuosly on roaming data, used maps for long hours, took hundreds of photos and captured few short videos, used for making contactless payments, used multiple apps at the same time and much more. I had a seamless experience with no hiccups at all. With 30w charger it takes around 1hr to fully charge. Within 15mins it can charge upto 25-30% approx.

Cons:
1. I found my LG G8x Thinq has a better display quality but this is just a personal experience.
2. Phone gets warm (not hot) when multi tasking is done. So it is with most of the devices.
3. Screen size feels little smaller when you shift from a bigger screen size.
4. You have to purchase super fast charging adapter, earbuds separately which will cost you around 2-3k.; The camera is worst em all, it is so bad in night light you will regret after using it.

Realme Narzo 7G Pro 5G: कम बजट में दमदार प्रदर्शन

Realme Narzo 70 Pro 5G किफायती दाम और फीचर्स के बीच संतुलन बनाता है. यह एक स्मूथ 120Hz डिस्प्ले, 5000mAh की लंबे समय तक चलने वाली बैटरी के साथ 67W फास्ट चार्जिंग और लेटेस्ट Android 14 सॉफ्टवेयर समेटे हुए आता है. साथ ही, यह एक अनोखा फीचर - टचलेस कंट्रोल के लिए एयर जेस्चर भी पेश करता है.

अहम बातें:

1. शार्प और स्मूथ डिस्प्ले: गेमिंग और स्क्रॉलिंग के लिए एक शानदार और रिस्पॉन्सिव 120Hz डिस्प्ले का आनंद लें.

Camera performance is good enough capture nice details; I have been using this phone past couple of days and here are my personal experience with the device.
Performance 4/5.
Although this is not the best performing phone is this price point but still i have not felt that because its really good and can run bgmi at smooth+extreme(that is the only game i played on this).
Software 5/5.
realme ui is known for bundling so many bloatware and ads but this phone had none of it, no hot apps and hot games and you can just disable apps like app market, game center etc. This probably might be the most smoothest smartphone is this price range, the animations and all are soo good. Haven't seen a single bug yet.
Battery 4/5.
Its pretty good, i got 6.5-7.5 hrs sot on really heavy usage like 4.5 hours gaming and on 5g network.
Camera 3/5.
I was kind of Disappointed with the camera despite having such a capable sensor(imx 890 same as one plus 11 Series). The colors are so saturated and unnatural. There is also a lot of oversharpening in the image and just ruins the details. The low light performance it pretty good and video quality is also pretty good but you dont get stabilization in 4k. I did download gcam which made things 100 times better than before.
Extras.
The speakers are really good
haptics are just okay
amazing network reception and wifi performance
Amazing software features.

Overall its a pretty good phone and I DO NOT REGRET making this purchase.; Writing after one week use. It's a good choice in this price range. Camera quality also good.."

What I love in this phone:

Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 processor never lets you down while performing heavy tasks.

Along with processor it also comes with dedicated Gaming Boost Engine that makes your gaming experience even smoother and longer without heating.

Double stereo speaker gives an awesome sound quality.

5500mah battery can easily last upto 2 days even after heavy usage. On moderate or average usage it gives you 3-4 days backup. And most important, 100 watt supervooc charger will charge it within 25 minutes, its a big adapter and weighs just like a brick.

50MP+8MP main camera setup is a functional camera setup and a 16MP selfie camera, its not gonna disappoint you but don't compare with those camera centric smartphones, this phone is heavily on performance side but still it is giving you a good camera.

Display is superb, amoled display that gives you high definition media quality.. bazzles are almost non existing and gives you a premium experience like flagship displays.

Comes with O-Haptics feedback and completely like Iphones..really loving it...

8GB RAM+8GB virtual RAM with 256GB UFS 3.1 ROM makes it superb and most importantly there are many of phones that gives you 12GB of RAM in this price range but don't look at the numbers, the biggest factor is brand and performance. Point to be noted, Its 8GB RAM is better than Realme, poco vivo or oppo 12GB RAM....

After starting the phone, you will start getting updates within a week, and will get many of new features even not described in specifications,, its a surprise for you...they are gonna give you even more features in updates that will make it a flagship killer..

Oneplus is just similar to Samsung or Apple, is better known for making premium and flagship devices, so I will not compare these brands with any other brands,,they are reliable and doing a great job in smartphone market, you can chose any one of these three brands..; Reviewing after 20days of usage.
Good performece won't say this phone is best but okay for normal usage not for gaming or super heavy user purpose. Display is decent thumbs up for it.
Camera is mediocre, battery run for whole day, good thing is it super charged with 100W charger from 20-100% in 30minute
phone is not heating as other are saying, althought it's normal for smartphone to get heated while charging so it happens with this one.
played Pubg fro 4-7hours non stop at HD settings it worked smoothly. Their is high performance mode and 120hz settings so not to worry we can turn it on for heavy usage like gaming but it will consume more battery.
Screen is is visible bright in outdoors against sunlight..
Phone will take around 20gb of storage for system.
my current occupied storage is 44gb with apps out of 128gb.
Phone UI is good not best, good thing is their is no bloaware their are some apps which we can disable easily.
with 20days of calling, gaming, heavy video watching i m satisfied with the product..no issue for now.
Even I dropped mistakenly this one it's fine with the cover nothing bad happened.
I m 1st time one plus user very happy, I also bought 1year extended warranty from official one plus website...so I have 2yrs manufacture warranty at extra Rs.599.
phone body is plastic nd fits good in big hands, small hand people will face problem holding the device.
Final suggestion yes go for it if you are normal usage watching videos, running different apps for various task, calling also decent but speaker is not too loud on call but that's acceptable.Price could have been lower around 18k or 20k something.
Bought at 24.5k.. of which 22k is price and 2.5k GST.; I usually not write ✍️ review very fast when it comes to smartphone. First I need to use it and under rigorous testing only I can put forward my verdict so that any brother or sister can buy the same from Amazon.
BODY : OnePlus has comeup with a very durable body and stylish. Looking premium.

DISPLAY: Its a PureAmoled with 10Bit resolution with crispy HDR10 features. Vibrant natural color and screen ratio is 88.5% to body ratio. So very less bezels.

BATTERY: Easily comes for 1 and half day if not playing any games. With games 1 day. No idle midnight auto battery drain and all. 5500mAh is very slowly discharging and due to 100w charger coming inside the box the mobile charges in 17 to 18minutes only upto 85% and full 100% charging approx 19 minutes as per my test.

CAMERA: Very ok for the price. I got one update recently in May 25, 2024 and after this the camera works wonderful specially selfie and portrait mode.

PROCESSOR: Snapdragon 7Gen3 name is enough that it is very stable and fast multi tasking and even this snapdragon version not heats up fastly. The clock speed is amazingly impressive to any games like PUBG or FreeFires or Asphalt. Rest all the medium games runs smoothly. No throttle. No lag and even No uncommon heating issues etc.

METWORK: Very fast 5G and even 4G also no issues. Runs smoothly without any call drop or any disturbance in voice quality. The Voice Focus mode works very nice even in the rush or crowded metro area. Last time recorded download speed was 175mbps & upload speed approx 145 to 166mbps.

STEREO SPEAKERS: This is what attracted me the most. The stereo speakers are very loud enough. And even it sync the eaarpods very quickly. OnePlus earpods are recommended for all those EQ and bass.

OVERALL VERDICT: Very lightest mobile inspite of 5500 mAh battery. Too premium boxy design. Call and network speed very impressive. After investing on this phone I have not regretted. Highly recommended and Value for money. Thanks Seller and Amazon. 100w charger in the box. Backcase and screen guard all in the box. A complete midrange killer phone. Highly valuable."

The first thing that caught my eye was the smoothness of its 120 Hz refresh rate. Navigating through the home screens, scrolling through social media, and even just browsing the web feels incredibly fluid and responsive. This feature alone has significantly enhanced the overall user experience for my mom, who isn't always up-to-date with the latest tech but can appreciate a device that runs smoothly and without lag.

The screen quality is another standout feature. The vibrant colors and sharp resolution make everything look more appealing, from photos to videos. My mom loves to watch cooking videos and tutorial clips on YouTube, and the display quality makes her viewing experience so much better. Additionally, the large screen size is perfect for her to see everything clearly without straining her eyes. But what really makes the Realme Narzo 70x a fantastic choice is its affordability. Despite its high-end features, it comes at a budget-friendly price, offering great value for money. This makes it an excellent option for anyone looking to give a loved one a quality smartphone experience without breaking the bank.; Good Product in this price. Camera Quality is good enough. Battery life is not good. Sound is good.; I bought this phone for study purposes, I came to know that it is way more than that,
I will simply write the pros and cons:
Pros: BATTERY: Phone charges within 1h 20m and lasts whole day.

DISPLAY : No doubt 120hz ultra smooth
PERFORMANCE: Never lags
HEATING: NO HEATING seen till now, it's been a week I purchased it.
CAMERA : 50MP camera takes too good photos however better choices are available if you go for camera.
Sound: this phone has speakers at top and bottom both
Cons:
The camera module bulges out i dont like it.

Conclusion : if you want to buy a budget gaming device, then go for it
It is for students, no doubt.
This Mobile is also for them who want to do coding , editing etc.
Connectivity is good in this Mobile phone with a lot of more features and Ease of use.; For its price of 12k (6/128):
•good display, design, charging speed& build quality.
•decent camera, audio (distorts at higher level), performance.

Got black lines on screen within a month of using (see the photo). Now i can't even ask for replacement from Amazon. Going to realme service centre to get it sorted out.. will keep y'all updated with how this ends up.

Update1- Visited the service centre & after little bit of argument the service centre guy accepted the device (after having few calls with higher executives) for screen replacement free of cost. However, due to congestion & election going the display will arrive after 4th June. Will update after 4th wether they stick to their promise or backtrack.

Update 2- Display is completely gone. See the last image.; The display is cool. Looks premium. Charges pretty fast. You max the volume over 100%. So for watching movies or series online, I think it's one of the best smartphones.; I am using this since 1 month and putting down all the observations here.
At first sight it looked beautiful. When i grabbed it alongwith the provided cover, felt little on the heavier side and somewhat bigger to operate for people having smaller fingers.(switched from redmi note 10)
Perfomance is good for this price range.
Loved the little tweaks it has done.
Rear camera is ok ok.
Front camera takes beautiful pictures.
45W charger provided in the box does its job well.
I am not a heavy user, so its perfect for me.; I like it but sometimes while playing a game it lags & frame drops but at the price rate it's OG definitely go for this
The camera is all best AI
AI gestures is a good feature to scroll some reels by hand in air
Battery life is quite good
Display is best
Quality is uhlalala
Weight is the lightest
Absolutely value for money; 5g network and charging speed are good.
Rest of all features, quality, performance and sound are average and not good."

There was a negligible heating issue, but after an update, everything is running buttery smooth, but the phone always tends to be in a warmer side. Need to mention that, here in my native place, the room temperature is high.

Battery Backup 8.5/10
Ui experience is very very good.
Charging speed is good.
Gaming performance is the best part of this phone. BGMI smooth+90fps 2x anti aliasing.

Will update my review after some days of usage.; This is the best and fastest phone I've ever used. 120 fps really makes a huge difference. Best phone at this price range. No doubt.; Works very fast; Everything is good in this phone. Hope it will run properly for a long time like my last phone.; Paisa wasul hai.; The phone is absolutely snappy, runs games like butter. After two weeks of using i would say I am absolutely satisfied.

Except for a few issues

--> 1. The Battery drains like crazy. It's understandable that the beast of a processor is the main reason. But still, otpimization should have been done more to manage the power consumption.

--> 2 The phones heats up, especially when charging and playing games in high settings.

--> 3 The Search box pops up the moment you open menu and it has got lots of ads.

--> This phone is strictly meant for performance not for camera. Camera is crappy, However, if you install google camera it turns ok.; Best phine under 24.500 😍😍😍😍 best gaming experience; The Poco X6 Pro is worth every penny, delivering outstanding performance and remarkable value for money.

Looks pretty elegant too. Does decent gaming BGMI at max settings in HD mode, and it does not heat up much; Overall a good phone, smooth, neat, fluid. But front cam is not so good, usable but not very good as I can take the picture it's looking a bit patchy. I think if they increased the camera quality even increasing the cost of phone a thousand or two if needed, it would have been even better. It's especially true in this era as everyone uses cameras.; Good Phone working well; It's mivmc isn't working; Great product in this price range; For me, most important feature of a phone is connectivity and call clarity. Unfortunately, Motorola failed in both the fronts.
I have used that brick size Motorola, used Motorola Razor but then moved to Nokia and then to Samsung. Was using various Samsung models for more than a decades and gradually felt that both Samsung quality and customer services dropped drastically. Samsung mastered warranty period!! Phone works precisely until the warranty and then fails!! - precision engineering and MTTF!!
Thought old, trusted Motorola might have recovered from their initial failures in smartphone and hence gave this Motorola a try.
I am using the same sim card, my locations are the same but now my calls are dropping every now and then. My phone is reported as unreachable or switched-off when it is not! I never had call dropping or signal issue earlier with my Samsungs - be it inside lift or in metro!
Moreover, Motorola call clarity is below par.
Motorola failed miserably in call connectivity and call clarity.
Not all are bad, build quality is slightly better, battery and camera is similar.
Also, there are just few service centres. So, repair will be a headache if you need it.
Overall, not worth for this unreliable phone.; the mobile phone is performing well; I am not satisfied with phone some times incoming call do not come on screen and it becomes blank.opening t of gallery photos is very slow ."

At first I was little sceptical about how things would go at this price range. I have used Vivo Nokia and Samsung at > Lava O2 budget and to be honest I am happy with this phone
Here are the pros of this phone:
Battery- 5000 mAh is good and lasts minimum of 7 hrs on heavy use and easily lasts a day on rough use
Charging time: 0-100% in nearly 2 hrs . Great! 4/5
Sound quality: sound quality is good but it doesn't really be hearable at low volume . A slight downgrade 3/5
Screen: To be honest, this has the best screen in this range or even above . Even my friends who owned mobile phones at the range of 15,000-30,000 had praised the screen of this phone. The punch hole display is a cherry on top of the cake. I could even see the screen at outdoors without any issues. Great! 5/5
Performance: The phone has a 8+8 combination of Ram and 128 gb ROM. I have tried various high end games on this phone and it's running good. Even it shows 30-40 Fps in COD mobile, but it doesn't feel like it,means it runs very smooth 5/5
I did also play solo leveling arise, Clash of clans,clash royale ,Bgmi ,FF , Farlight and asphalt series. All ran good in this phone . Best!
Storage: Imagine I have a lot of games in this phone simultaneously. Like all the above mentioned. I even have downloaded the expansion pack of some of the games completely. Still I have 50% of storage left. Means the storage system is great! 5/5
Camera: the camera setup is of 50Mp primary sensor with another one may be of potriat ig . But the camera is great . I had some very good photos but Amazon isn't letting me upload them . It has various camera modes and a good selfie sensor. Good! 4/5

Now for the cons:
Camera : After the update I got this problem . The camera lags while taking videos or photos. But in the gallery it is good. I hope the camera is maintained good in future updates
Charging issues: Not much issues but the phone gets very hot and thanks to the glass back 🙂 it just acts like salt sprinkled on a bruise
Device: Only after update I saw this problem. Sometimes when I open the app, the app suddenly closes and also closes each and every open tabs. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible
Touch sensitivity: Sometimes when I am grinding in fps games . When I press the attack button I have to press twice first as the button itself becomes unresponsive at first only. This has happened multiple times leading into losing the match💔

Overall the phone is great . Please resolve the issues seen after update as soon as possible. Kudos!; Nice Phone,Good Bounceback by Lava,
Phone Looks Good,Light weight and Working Smooth...Overall Very Good Smartphone In this Price Range...; I have purchased this LAVA O2 mobile, but it's not reached our expectations. I should replace the mobile. The main issue was call voice is not audible. There is some issue in the mobile. Looking forward to hearing from you positive response.
Overall the mobile is not good. Please replace the mobile.; Overall nice phone with regards to its design, performance, display, sound quality and battery. Very nice made in india phone at such price.; Very good 4G phone, with smooth finish and touch. Very good build quality. Stylish design.

Likes :
1. Proudly Indian
2. Clean Android 13. No bloatware. It's stock Android.
3. Premium glass back design.
4. Ultra smooth touch screen.
5. No lags as of now.
6. Fast fingerprint sensor.
8. Big memory inthis price (8GB, 128GB).
9. It's charging very fast.

Not likes:
1. May be better images expected with 50MP. But ok in this price. Need improvement in camera app.
Update1: updated and now camera is good.

It's truly competition to other brands.
Go for LAVA. Don't let your money go out of India.

#ProudlyIndian; Battery's drained in 6-7hrs, speakers volume is very low in compare to the Vivo phone.
Looks and screen is good. camera good; I was looking for phone for my Generative AI development work where I can memory for my Apps rather bloatware using that memory. Initially when I saw it there was no review but it was mentioned 8GB RAM and bloatware free Android Experience so I picked up and this phone has surprised me.

Here are few good points.
1) Bloatware free android experience and Only google Apps and two Lava Apps along with system apps.
2) Standby time it quite impressive
3) Phone design is also quite impressive
4) There is free phone cover and Phone charger which most of other companies are not providing now a days
5) Currently I am running large language model with Ollama and llama.cpp with models like llama3, phi3, mistral, sqlcoder, starcoder, gemma:2b, qwen and all other models ranging from 900 mb to 4.7gb size.
6) python, nodejs, open source web apps also working quite fast.

Considering All above in 7999 INR after coupon is great deal not only for user but also for developer, I expect LAVA to bring bloatware free experience with 16 and 32GB with 512/1TB internal memory in future at competitive price so that we can keep running bigger technology in Android mobile.

Thank you LAVA.; Lava O2 is the most fastest and amazing phone under 8k. I bought it for 7,499 in sale. It's performance has not disappointed me for once. Alltho am giving 4 stars because phone has heating issues. I've been using it for a few days so here's my opinion on the topics :-

• Battery life : Average for a 8k Phone can easily give a 6hr run time while playing games.
• Quality : Build Quality is 10/10. Phone gives an expensive look. Overall good.
• Camera : Average, back camera can be improved.
• Sound Quality : Sound quality is good too and speakers are fine as well.
• Gaming : Light gaming can be done but playing heavy games like BGMI and COD can cause heating. For normal gaming like roblox, Subway surfer, etc. . It's good.
• Heating : The phone heats up quite fast. It's heating the most while charging.
• Easy to use : It's actually smooth and it's ram is also good which gives a smooth experience.
• RAM and ROM : Compared to other companies, lava gives more ROM and it's 8gb ram is also very efficient. Expandable Ram hasn't been in much use but it's smooth.

You can't expect a 8k Phone to compete iPhone or other expensive phones. It's the best one in the segment. Go for it, it's Indian and efficient."

Mentioning the experience after using the phone for more then a week.

Display: The screen on the HONOR X9b is truly impressive. The colors are vibrant, and the display is crisp, providing a visually stunning experience for watching videos and browsing through photos and most importantly my eyes are safe. It's a visual treat that adds a whole new dimension to my smartphone experience.

Performance: Zero issues with hanging or lagging. The HONOR X9b handles multitasking seamlessly, and switching between apps is a breeze. It has proven to be a reliable companion for all my daily tasks, making every interaction smooth and efficient. Also, being a moderate gamer, I feel its a great device to handle games on high settings.

Battery Life: I'm pleasantly surprised by the battery life. With normal usage, I can easily go through a full day, and there's still some juice left at the end. It's reassuring not to worry about constantly searching for a charger – a definite plus for a busy lifestyle.

Design and Comfort: The sleek design of the HONOR X9b adds a touch of elegance, and it's comfortable to hold. The phone strikes the right balance in terms of weight. I always question myself how it comes with a 5800mAh massive battery? Making it a joy to use for extended periods without causing any discomfort.

Camera: The camera on the HONOR X9b is outstanding. It captures sharp and vivid photos. Selfies come out looking great, and the overall camera performance adds a lot to the phone's appeal.

In summary, my experience with the HONOR X9b has exceeded my expectations. From the stunning display to the reliable battery life and impressive camera performance, it's a device that offers great value. If you're considering an upgrade, the HONOR X9b is definitely worth considering – a smartphone that delivers on both style and substance. Highly recommended!; It has12MP default camera. Can adjust to 108MP camera, Photos has good details in day light and also low light but Camera UI is too Old.

UI is clean, No blot wear but today is 25.05.2024 still no Android 14 update.
Overall the battery is best. You got 1.5day battery backup.
There are better camera option in this price range.; This is the new phone with play store and Google apps.
Display is super good and no eye strain even if you use full time. For my job, I'm using full time.
UI is good as any other Huawei.
Good battery backup, no heating while charging. But charging speed is not fast for the 30 watts. Type C to 3.5mm converter and a plastic headset is on the box.
Volume is average.
Histen audio quality and sound customisation is excellent.
Front camera is good and natural color of skin, not mixing jk wall putty like oppo.
Rear camera is average because of natural color, not punchy.
Touch is butter smooth and palm rejection is excellent.
Charging is slowing when you using or using Hotspot while charging, this is for protecting battery for long life.
Call quality, calling while traveling, network reception 4G to 5G changing, all are good.
Processor is capable for any tasks and Huawei honour is master in multitasking and keeping phone without hanging.
Go for it if you want excellent display, good battery backup, long life, extra warranty, natural tone selfie, and a non cracking display during fall. On top of that, it's a different experience to use Honor.
( I used Samsung, Iqoo, realme, HTC, Asus, Redmi and felt Honor OS is better); 4 months of using this mobile phone got this from amazon itself.
1.Amazon did proper delivery no issue
2.Battery issue
The makers claim to have a bigger battery set into this phone which I feel is of no use
Battery stands only for a day which is less for such big battery
No charger is provided with the box also it has very slow charging It doesnt have fast charging W option.. Takes 2 hrs to full charge
3.brigthness is very low you can get more nits brightness under this budget.. Outdoor performance is low
4.main issue is single speaker you can't even hear if your phone is on speaker and if someone being talking loud.
5.camera videography doesn't have OIS even a 15k phone nowadays has such feature.
6.under 10 percent the mobile can't stand more than 5 mins. Even with no apps running in background.

If you have low maintenance with your phone or you can't handle your phone you frequently break your phones.. You can go for this by adjusting all other features which you can go for under this range.

Nice display, no inbuilt ads like redmi, nice camera.

Only battery could have convinced me more than anything. I knew everything before I trusted in honor and it didn't work either.; The phone is good overall,
Screen is really good, durability is on point. Camera is decent, battery life is very good.
But it hangs sometimes especially when running camera. It has happened twice or thrice in a month. Hope it gets resolved with newer updates"

A perfect full package.; Writing this review after 20 days usage. In my opinion

1. if anyone need to buy light weight mobile I will recomend to buy.

2. Best UI in recent time there is no lag when operating the mobile, opening an app like Hot star, Netflix app there is no lag and no delay on open a video.

3. Camera best quality in camera amazing front 16MP and back 50MP one of the best get live location scenery.

4. Battery Life - For only soft use without any Gaming guarantee upto 48 hrs charge life. Fast charging from 20% to 100% in just 45 to 50 mins.

5. Feel less when playing Games, I am playing PUBG games it took battery drainage slightly up. When playing 2 hrs 10 to 15% charge is going down.

6. Heating Issue - There is no heating issue when playing games. played 2 hrs not feel any heating problem. Recommended this for all heavy users.
(Note - it's my views, it's upto you how many hours you are using)

7. Game Mode - Fantastic when On Ultra Game mode, you can control your battery life mode when playing games, as said above still battery might fell down as per my previous review.

8. Music is best like Vivo up and down speakers provide best quality. Using Boult ear buds gives you a different feel when hearing music.

9. Video - 1800x2400 video resolution gives best viewing experience when watching videos

10. Over all Review - One of best mobile satisfied with all performance till now. No external memory recommended to buy 256GB model.

Internal memory 8G+8G extended gives smooth performance. 14 Android OS still good to go.; This phone is only people who wants high performance phone.

Pros :
- Display is great. But it's 8-bit panel. Previously i've used 10-bit pOLED.
- Processor just better. Doing everyday task with no stutters.
- Good at gaming.
- Charging speed is good. (Previously I had 33w charger. This one is 44w. )
- Primary Camera is just good. ( But in Night struggles alot. )

Cons :
- Operating System ( Not that really fan. Bloatwares are not a problem. You can remove then easily. Just spend 10 minutes then whole OS will be cleaner. ) OS is not good if you are coming from stock android.
- Ultra-wide is missing as it was must for me.
- Copy files with PC is slower than avg.
- Speaker is average. ( It's mono speaker but still average )

For I got it for 20,500 - 8+256; Two weeks ago, I made the switch to the iQOO Z9 5G from my previous phone, the Realme Narzo 30 5G. Given the higher price point of the iQOO Z9 5G, I had high expectations. While there are certainly improvements, the experience hasn't been overwhelmingly better compared to its cost.

**Pros:**
Display and Touchscreen:The iQOO Z9 5G boasts a very smooth and high-resolution display, which is a noticeable upgrade. The touchscreen responsiveness is impressive and provides a seamless interaction experience.

Performance:This is where the iQOO Z9 5G shines. It's faster and I've experienced no lags whatsoever during my usage. Apps open quickly, and multitasking is a breeze.

Camera:The camera quality is good. However, I missed some of the AI scene recognition features that were available in my previous phone, which added a bit more versatility to the photography experience.

Storage and RAM:For my everyday needs, the storage and RAM have been sufficient. I haven't run into issues with storage space or multitasking performance.

Cons:

Battery:The battery life has been disappointing. It drains much faster, especially when using dual SIM and 5G capabilities. The phone struggles to retain charge, which is a significant drawback for me.

Operating System:The OS feels unpolished, with many pre-installed applications that I find useless. There's a notable lack of customization options, which makes the user experience feel constrained.

Connectivity:Although it shows 4G as 4G+, I've noticed a slowdown in mobile network connectivity. This has been particularly frustrating when making UPI payments, as the slowness directly impacts transaction times.

In conclusion, while the iQOO Z9 5G does offer some upgrades in terms of display, performance, and camera quality, it falls short in areas like battery life and operating system polish, which are crucial for a seamless smartphone experience. The connectivity issues further add to the frustration, making me question the value proposition of this upgrade."

Let me share my experience with you.

First and foremost, the camera setup on the iQOO 12 is nothing short of remarkable. Boasting a triple camera configuration of 50+50+64MP, the pictures captured are not only vivid but also showcase a unique and distinctive style that sets it apart from other iQOO models. Even compared to my sister's more expensive phone, the iQOO 12 outshines with its superior camera quality. I am genuinely delighted and satisfied with the camera performance.

The design of the iQOO 12 is another standout feature. The metal sides give it a premium feel, and the device's grip is both comfortable and secure. The impressive build quality is evident, making it a pleasure to hold and use.

The user interface is clean and intuitive, contributing to an overall positive user experience. Navigating through the device is a breeze, adding to my satisfaction with the iQOO 12.

In terms of battery life, I am pleased with the performance so far. Although the charging time is approximately 25 minutes for a full charge, the endurance of the battery makes it bearable, as I don't find myself needing to charge frequently. A small trade-off for extended usage.

Gaming on the iQOO 12 is a delight. I tried Call of Duty, and the smooth touch response, fast loading times, and immersive vibrations on kills left me thoroughly impressed. The device delivers a seamless gaming experience that enhances the overall satisfaction of owning this flagship phone.

Overall, I consider the iQOO 12 a great purchase, especially for those looking for an exceptional gaming, multimedia, and camera experience within a budget of 50k. While there might be some software experience quirks, the device's performance in gaming, multimedia consumption, and photography make it a worthy investment that won't leave you disappointed. If you're in the market for a feature-packed smartphone, the iQOO 12 is a solid choice 💯😊😊; Using Iqoo 12 Alpha 512/16GB variant since a week.
Camera is outstanding, phone operating performance is too smooth, network & data speed is awesome, data transfer is unbelievably outstanding, display is too good. Here I will rate individuals:

Rear camera : 10/10
Front camera : 7/10
Display : 10/10
Speakers : 9/10
Network & Data : 10/10
Wireless connectivity: 9/10
Data transfer : 10/10 (Both wired & wireless)
Build quality: As of now it seem strong
OS : 7/10 (OS side improvement required a little bit, but you won't find issues though in routine)

The phone stand different because of few following things which less discussed. It has WiFi 7 & UFS4.0, both makes data transfer wired & wirelss in smooth manner, There is no phone in this price can do this. Camera is really magical, normal, telephoto, portrait works really well. Also, OIS in video recording works really awesome, it has horizontal lock in OiS which records steady portrait video even if camera rotated 360 degree. Photos are well in low light too which you can't expect in this budget flagships. If you are about to purchase entry level DSLR along with phone, this phone can serve for both except few high end requirements. Front camera is okay or can say good if proper loght is there, Don't expect Vivo selfie feel in this. Charging speed is magical, it takes 30 minutes from 10% to 100%. There are some minor software issues are there which they are listening & working on too so no worries about it, they can resolve them in upcoming updates.

I suggest to check all detailed technical specifications before purchasing as this is my personal experience review with my expectations. This is my first phone with such budget and I'm satisfied well for what i paid.

Note : Few users may have reported battery drain and heating. I can say high network variations & constant heavy processing in CPU & GPU can make it, but as of now I've not faced either. If you use phone in well manner, it won't disappoint.; Got phone today. Very much impressed with the delivery by amazon. Phone is awesome. Camera , Performance, Gaming, display, charging everything is good . Value for money 💜. Just go for it"

I would say this mobile is one of the best and value for money mobile in this price segment.

1)Performance:

The mobile performs seemlessly in all the tasks it went through.

I Played bgmi and other games in high settings and the phone handed it very well.

But I also faced heating issue with higher setting, which is common but it didn't affect it's performance and few fps drops

2) Display:

One word to describe, awesome.

The colour are pretty accurate, bright and the haptics are great which feels like the phone is communicating.

I heard from other comments, the display is not good under the sun, yeah that's true but it's is still visible to use the phone under the direct sun light without any problem.

3) Charging and Battery standby:

It takes 30-35 minutes to full charge, that's pretty great for a phone at this price range.

It takes 20 minutes to charge the phone to 80%, and I would also recommend you to charge it till 80 by turning on the option so the battery life last long.

And about the backup, it solidly last more than a day for normal use and when u play games it drains faster.
U can play for around 3hrs with 80% charge.

Camera:

It's performance is pretty amazing, I won't it is the great but it does it's job.

The colors, skin tone, background accurate and especially the portraits, really perfect. The edge cutting and blurring the background are just top-notch.

The videos are stable(as u can see in the video), capture the exact colour, retailing is good and they are not noisly and the low light videos are good not too good.

And the low light photos are decent, but the photo from night mode are absolutely amazing and it's retailing is good and selfies are also nice

About the macro and ultra wide:

To be practical we won't use it in our day to day like.

If ur need is good and decent photos and videos just for it u, will love it.

If u want a better camera and u are buying it only for camera and features, this won't be right choice.

4) Connectivity:

I haven't faced any issues with the connectivity till now but from my experience, it's is up to the mark.

I am using Airtel with a 4g sim and I got upto 270mbs speed.

And the Bluetooth connectivity is amazing.

5) Case and conclusion:

The case they are giving is rigid and the in hand feel is good. They are not slippery and does it's job.

To conclude, you won't get a better phone at this price range, with lot of features, performance and a great camera. I would granty u, it will a hell of a experience.

Here’s why I love it:

Design and Feel:
First off, it looks and feels premium. The sleek design and solid build make it feel way more expensive than it actually is. It's comfortable to hold and use, which is a big plus.

Display:
The screen is gorgeous. The AMOLED display is bright and vibrant, making everything from videos to games look fantastic. Plus, the high refresh rate makes scrolling and animations super smooth.

Performance:
Even though it has a weaker processor compared to other upper mid-range smartphones, the performance is still really good. Apps open quickly, and multitasking is a breeze. I’ve played some pretty graphics-heavy games on it, and it handles them surprisingly well.

Camera:
The camera setup is really impressive. Photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light. The extra lenses for wide-angle shots and close-ups add a lot of versatility. It’s perfect for snapping great photos on the go.

Battery Life:
Battery life is solid. It easily lasts all day with heavy use, and the fast charging is a lifesaver when you’re in a hurry. No more waiting around for your phone to charge!

Software:
HyperOs is smooth and feature-packed. It takes a bit to get used to if you’re coming from another brand, but it’s intuitive and has a lot of useful features.

Overall, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ is a fantastic choice if you want a high-quality phone without spending a fortune. It delivers great performance, a beautiful display, and a top-notch camera all at an affordable price. Definitely recommend it!

Bonus: There's no heating issue observed when doing demanding tasks!; First of all let's go with the pros
Display: the best thing I liked about this device is it's display am first time using an amoled curved display and it's soo good it's super smooth with 120hz and the colors are good too and within a week this device fall from about 6 feet and 3-4 times and there was not even a scratch it shows the victus protection does it's job well
• some of the users claim that the 120 watts is not working it's taking about 50 mins but actually if you try to charge the device out of the box it will shows that 120w quick charge but you need to go to settings>battery and switch on the boost charging then only it gives you true 120w potential in 19 mins
• I had test the device dipped in water for 15 mins and still there is no issues found so the ip68 also works good
• And i got and update from miui to xiaomi hyperos
And the ui is also super smooth without any bugs found
• and about gaming the device gives a smooth experience I played freefire in max settings in high fps and still I got about 50fps and i tried e-football ect.. And the device heats up a bit still not overheating in gaming I didn't found any shutters or lags it works smooth
Cons:
I think this stuff is a bit overpriced
The camera is not up to the mark in these price range
But still it can be fixed with a software update
And the battery drains fast I don't think it's 5000 mah my 5 yrs old vivo gives more backup than this but still 120w just full in 19 mins
And the other features are good about these device the cons can be just fixed by an update and after all i love these phone don't mind the negative comments just go for it and i have a suggestion it's bit over priced so you can buy it on offer times and it's not an performance oriented device if you are a gamer or looking that types of phne you can go for iqoo neo 9 Or something and that's all about these device I think this review may help you and i I'll update if I faced any prblms thank you😊; I am using REDMI NOTE 13 PRO+ since last one month. Totally satisfied with the performance of the device. Display is very good and smooth. 100W Fast charging is excellent. Battery life is very good. Both the camera front and rare is beautiful. It gives some great picture even at low light. This is the most value for money phone available in the market.; When I opened my box, it has some query but no one is taking responsibility to resolve or replace it . It has battery drain issue and again camera is not at all good. Redmi note 9 has batter camera than this phone; Heating in nirmal usage, Fast charging not working while using the phone this is very irritating thing, Laging if it is using 120 refresh rate. Not smooth. Display is good. Camera is good but not extra ordinary performance. Weight is also heavy. I dont recommend.; A very good phone camera is very smooth In 60fps .. night shoot is not good this is day camera . Charging very fast within 25 min battery full; Superb phone in this budget; Sometimes there is a lag issue and battery is kinda bad .Remaining else all good; منتج سييييئ جدا ولا يعمل وقد طلبت ارجاعه واسترداد المبلغ ولم اعهد ذلك من سوق ضخم كأمزون لتني اثق بمبيعاته ولكن صدمت هذه المرة"

First, let's discuss the design. The Moonstone Silver color is stunning and gives the phone a premium appearance and feel. The curved edges and thin size make it easy to handle and fit into my pocket. The 6.5-inch Full HD+ display is bright and clear, ideal for streaming videos and gaming. The Redmi 12 delivers excellent performance. I have enough room to save all of my programs, photographs, and movies with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.

I have been able to multitask effortlessly and haven't faced any issues with the phone slowing down. The following pros and cons are after using this phone for months.

Pros: 5000mAh Battery
128GB+ 6GB+1 TB expandable storage

Only disappointment is camera quality is bad, I use oneplus ce2 which has 64MP camera. CE 2 camera is better than note 13.; Overall mobile is good but battery backup is not so good and charging speed is also not good.; Product is excellent .... But built quality is not up to the mark.... Rest it is a very good phone; I like the slim design, super fast charging, girilla glass, and extreme light weight whike being feature rich at the same time. Loving it. Even friends and colleagues ask which phone it is. One more thing to mention phone came with a silicon back cover which is wonderful and have pastic on the screen to protect from dust and oil etc so no need to go to mobile shop yet for any accessories as well. What more could you want at this price :) happy ✌; Very good product best quality 👌; Camera is very good
Battery not like 5000mha; The newly purchased phone has been experiencing excessive overheating, posing a potential safety hazard. Despite promptly escalating the issue for replacement or return, the request was denied after a three-day grace period, leaving me with no choice but to visit the Redmi service center for repairs. Unfortunately, the service center's only action was a software update that resulted in the loss of all my data. They further stated that they were unable to address the overheating and battery concerns. This situation is deeply concerning, as it involves a brand-new device that requires immediate attention.
Buy another phone don't even think about it.; Two days ago I bought 8 GB Ram and 256 storage. Redimi Note 13 is very lightweight and very handy. charge is very fast. the phone reaches 20% to 100% takes time 30-35 minutes.

but I feel battery backup isn't like 5000 mAh. charges stay two days if you don't use the internet. if you use 24 hrs internet and so many phone calls are attended or received, for that 100% charge stays for 10-12 hrs.

The camera is not like 108mp. standard camera. if you want to use this phone for a camera, I suggest don't take it. but one thing I want to say, it's selfie camera is good."

Overall rating: 4.5 stars.; This review is based on just one day of usage.

Likes

1.The hardware- the hardware is topnotch for the price. The chipset is fairly decent, cameras are good (not great, but usable images), speakers are above average. Screen is also perfectly usable. Full hd screen with 90 hz refresh rate. Fingerprint sensor is accurate and quick. No heating issues as of now (I haven't used the phone extensively; see other reviews for heating).
2. Charging- it is the best feature of this product. The charging is truly best in class. Half filled the phone from zero in just under 30 minutes.
3. Battery- again very good. The chipset being sub-flagship is very conservative in battery consumption. As a result, phone easily last more than a day. I charged it yesterday at noon and I still have around 30% left at 7 pm today.

Mediocre

1. Camera- not best in class. The back camera is decent under good lighting. But quickly looses it when the light fades. Night photography is not good. Selfie camera too is not very good, but still give usable photos in good lighting. Again, I bought this phone for my mom, photography is not her strong point! So, it's perfectly fine for her as it gets the job done most of the times.
2. Features- the system has good features such as overnight charging, minimised screen, gesture shortcuts etc. But the overall experience of the UI is ruined by ads, which is the number one problem I have with this phone.

Dislikes

1. Ads ads ads. Everywhere you look, there are ads. There are ads in the app launcher, there are ads each time you install an app, there are ads when you clear cache using the native cleaner app. There are apps installed on its own without even giving permission. I spend so much time removing all the unnecessary apps and after sometime, some of them came back. The realme app store is the culprit, I believe. Because, after disabling the store, the installing of apps on their own had stopped. This is really a nuisance and realme should never make it so hard for us to remove unwanted apps. Giving ads is one thing, but this is outright attacking people with ads, which is not at all a pleasant experience. There are some app groups called hot games and hot apps which are stupid and came back even after I disabled them twice. Eventually I was able to remove them for good. Only one tip for you- disable and remove network access for the realme app store and you can hopefully uninstall unwanted apps. There were no native keyboard applications (like Xiaomi), thankfully.

Verdict- a good option for people with limited budget and needs. There is nothing amazing (except for battery life), but the phone is perfectly usable and fast enough to not being called a slow phone. The UI has good features but infected with ads. I believe premium offerings of realme don't have this problem. Not for people who love ad-free stock Android experience. But gets the job done with little money. Better than the lower budjet (6k-8k) phones. I will give 3.7 out of 5.; Realme narzo n55,i purchased 2 phones and it's quality is so good,rare camera is fine, I love the blue and black colour, slim and so sturdy .; Best quality and value for money"

From its design to its performance, this smartphone has a lot to offer.

Firstly, the design of the Tecno Pova 5 Pro is sleek and modern. It has a large 6.8-inch display with thin bezels, which provides an immersive viewing experience. The phone has a sturdy build and feels comfortable to hold. The fingerprint sensor on the back is quick and reliable, allowing for hassle-free unlocking of the device.

In terms of performance, the Tecno Pova 5 Pro performs excellently. It is powered by a MediaTek Helio G80 processor coupled with 6GB of RAM, which ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance. Whether I was browsing the internet, playing graphics-intensive games, or watching videos, the phone handled everything effortlessly. The 128GB internal storage is ample for storing my files, apps, and media.

The battery life of the Tecno Pova 5 Pro is truly impressive. With its massive 6,000mAh battery, I was able to use the phone extensively throughout the day without worrying about running out of power. Even on days of heavy usage, the battery easily lasted a full day, which is a huge plus for me.

The camera performance of the Tecno Pova 5 Pro is also commendable. It features a quad-camera setup, including a 48MP primary sensor, a 2MP macro lens, a 2MP depth sensor, and an AI lens. The photos captured were sharp, rich in detail, and had accurate colors. The 8MP front camera captured decent selfies with good skin tones.

The software experience of the Tecno Pova 5 Pro is smooth and user-friendly. It runs on HiOS 7.0 based on Android 10, providing a clean interface and a plethora of customization options. The phone also comes pre-loaded with useful apps and features that enhance the overall experience.

Overall, the Tecno Pova 5 Pro is a fantastic smartphone with a lot to offer. With its impressive performance, long-lasting battery, and capable camera system, it is a great choice for anyone looking for a mid-range smartphone. I highly recommend it for its value for money proposition, and it certainly exceeded my expectations.; All over performance is good, Selfie camera could be better, photos from 50mp are satisfactory.
Sometime backlight is not working.
Charging is fast, no lag time, touch is good
Sound quality could be better from both sounds, Display is good
Rest is okay ......
Backlight isn't working; Hey all,

It's been almost 6months I'm using this phone: Tecno Pova Pro 5g. And I got to say that Tecno has done a really great job in providing such a masterpiece.

Pros:
1. Gets more attention than iPhone users for starters.
2. Performance and features like backlight, my video show, bluetooth/signal connectivity are top notch.
3. Camera quality is good, and features like super night and video editing are amazing.
4. Dual speakers for optimal sound output.
5. Never lags on anything even for multiscreen uses.
6. Face unlock and fingerprint/security is A grade.

Cons:
AI Camera whitewashes images, so a darker person may appear with a lighter skin tone.

Overall my recommendation is GO for it. It is the best Phone in this price range and also beats many more brands' phones which are expensive for the sake of clout and gives them a run for their incapablities.

Thank you Tecno.; I got the device on republic day sale at 13k..although I was a moto user I prefer stock android anyday..but I must say tecno did a good job on its ui..I am using this phone for 15 days and pros are: good performance...very good display..decent back camera..very smooth and lag free gaming experience..nice rgb backlight
Cons are: below avg front cam...battery backup may be improved
Overall a very nice 5g device in 13k range..very good for day to day usage..satisfactory gaming experience..but not for camera enthusiasts..
Hope this will help; 1. So I purchased this product as a gaming phone but it's giving 40fps rating also in bgmi it's graphics are smooth + high available only.
2. Camera quality is good but not that much.
3. I loved the sound quality 😍
4. Best design and build of body looks cool as a gaming phone.
5. Charging was good for first 7 days now not getting charged as given watt is 68 but charges at the speed of 25w
6. Display quality and colours are pretty cool
7. Back side glymph light is very very cool.

Final results - purchase it as a budget phone for daily use not as a gaming phone ☺️; I recommend this phone; Dunque, dunque. Ho aspettato di usarlo per due giorni prima di scrivere questa recensione. Per chi non vuol leggere troppo sintetizzo: davvero un ottimo prodotto di fascia media.
Partiamo punto per punto.
Design: 9 davvero bella la scocca posteriore con motivi in rilievo e la retroilluminazione a led RGB utile anche per notifiche. Effetto wow garantito. Il fronte è piuttosto simile a tanti altri, ma ha comunque bordo tra fine schermo e scocca piuttosto limitato tranne che per la parte in basso più spessa.
Materiali: 8 il telefono è ben assemblato e realizzato. Tuttavia tranne per il vetro frontale è composto di plastica. Sia il retro che la scocca laterale. Quindi è consigliabile usare sempre una cover a protezione.
Hardware: 8,5 il telefono è fluido, lo schermo ha una ottima definizione seppur non essendo amoled, bensì LCD IPS, si comporta bene. I neri sono quelli comunque di un pannello LCD, quindi non esattamente neri. Comunque per certo versi io lo preferisco per la resa dei colori e delle sfumature. Troppo contrasto mi dà noia e poi è 120 hertz di refresh. Non affatica gli occhi. Tanta RAM tanta Rom che si può espandere, dual SIM, 5g, doppio speaker, presa cuffie, Bluetooth 5.1, GPS, NFC, ricarica rapida. Non manca quasi nulla.
Fotocamere: 7,5 forse la parte meno interessante. Tuttavia funzionano più che dignitosamente. Anche in notturna si possono ottenere scatti utilizzabili. Sconsiglio l'uso di AI. Video accettabili... si sente la mancanza dello stabilizzatore.
Audio: 9 potente e di qualità sia dal doppio speaker che dalla presa cuffie. Anche in Bluetooth tutto ok
Batteria: 8 si carica velocissimamente grazie all'alimentatore da 68w e in versione SIM singola il telefono regge molto molto bene la giornata. Con il dual SIM acceso arriverete comunque a sera con un 10/15% di autonomia residua.
Segnale telefonico: 8,5 prende bene. Nessun problema con wifi, Bluetooth e GPS. Purtroppo arrivo fino a 4g+ non avendo una SIM 5g
Processore, Rom, RAM: 9 mai un impuntamento, tutto scorre fluido.
Voto finale 8,5
Cosa sarebbe la ciliegina sulla 🍰:
Ricarica wireless, scocca laterale in metallo e dietro in vetro. Non inserisco schermo amoled, perché non reputo sarebbe di qualità su questa fascia di prezzo.
Lo consiglio: assolutamente si! Arrivo da un notissimo marchio... Avevo bisogno di un telefono con schermo più grosso per motivi di vista, senza farmi dissanguare.
Povo 5 pro 5g è un apparecchio che non mi fa rimpiangere troppo il telefono precedente.

Even with normal use, the phone occasionally gets hot. Sometimes, you can literally fry an egg using the backside of this phone.

3.Front Camera:

Horrible front camera performance. It doesn't offer the quality of even a below 10K budget phone. The rear camera is decent."

I visited authorised service centre of samsung. They said, this problem will resolve after updating the new software update they had with them. Still the problem persistent. Again visited authorised samsung service centre, they once a again updated with new software update. But the problem is not resolving completely.
Unhappy customers, Samsung should look into it.
Should provide good software update or should replace this phone with other brand good mobile phone.
Don't know whether Samsung is reading these much hanging problems reviews from customers. Samsun should work on this.
Also the camera quality is average.

06.05.2024
Updating review after 2 months of use. Still this mobile is hanging, though the frequency is decreased after updating software.
Still not satisfied with this mobile. Much cheaper quality of phone. Price should around 5k to 6k for this phone.
Better you can purchase any Chinese made mobile phone, avoid Samsung !!; Volume slightly low, speakers are average, can't able to hear clear sound.picture quality was poor like smoothness ..not real photo captured. Touch was little bit problem .Not worth for money; Good phone with good specs and colour; I have been using this mobile almost a month now. I have not faced much issues than slight hanging but not always (during multi tasking). Battery back up is good. Camera is good but price is bit high. When i reduce the refresh rate , i feel little lag.; Very good; good nice"

After getting 3 days of experience I wil share the pros and cons
First ofcourse the pros
1. Superb AmoLED display with that curve.... Wow it's too great.... It looks like you own a 50k+ mobile
2. Camera quality is decent.. but have so much filters will blow and surprise you lol... I mean about photos... Video is on average .. yes you can shoot on 4k but the stability is too low
But once again guys the photo is awesome with those filters I am totally satisfied
3. Superfast GPU and RAM..
4. Awesome in-hand experience.
5. No blotwares I say nothing only stock apps like we needed Google apps as we use daily
6. So much built in features like a samsung Max phones have.. especially the preventive touch option, in display scanner, lock app option, lock folder option, clone app function, ram enhance, those camera filters are awesome especially on front cam.. I say oppo filters will be 2nd if we compare both
7. Taptics... Wow it's too awesome I say samsung and iPhone will have to get that hands on effects.. it's too good... I recomend to disable the sound effect while we clicking
8. The intelligent part is it's using a stock Android OS so we can disable almost anything.

CONS

1. As this product is newly launched its case and screen guard is still not provided on Amazon. But It says it got the newer Gorilla glass protection and won't need screen guard... Hmmm I still need to figure it out
2. As I said the phone case also is not available, we got a back clear cover with the phone but it's too low quality. I am sure it will turn yellow in 4 weeks ( a secret... I found a full glass case 3 in 1 on f l I p k a r t. I ordered it will update when I get that
3. As I use currently a iPhone 8... It's too builky on my pockets and always keep opening screen and asking to use my fingure print to open. There is a option to disable accidental screen pressing but it still annoying and drain battery slowly ( so when I put the phone on pockets, I try to put the way that the front camera is on the front side .. open side
4. It's fast charging is awesome but there is nothing to prevent the phone to put slow charging when it reach 80% and go normal. It rush to 100% and turn off charging ( I heard that after having 80% battery it's not good to fast charging... I am low with tech.. so leaving to those tech guys for a better review
5. The back clear case which the company provided is not good. Just back case . Can't protect as the camera part is buldged
6. Amazon didn't allow to get additional warranty as they give to other phones with price of 1500-2000, that's really bad
7. No amazon sellers provide accidental or water protection damage replacement
8. Also LAVA say they will replace the product at home for 1 year. But for only hardware issues... So I recomend to keep this phone as a baby

Finally I love this awesome product which I got it lately after getting so many comparisons and much more waiting. They told to serve it in 2 days but need to be patient as I got it after 9 days...

Update after 1 Month... We won't get any back case or flip case for the product.. the screen protector available is a substitute f om. Vivo v27+ but it's UV glass.. after scratch we need to remove carefully after 1 hour try slowly and peacefully else you will ruin the AmoLED display
I request the company to release more good cases and add the insurance to protect the devise as the other gadgets give us; I have been using this phone since last 2 months. It's good . Camera quality is ok for amount not great. Battery life is decent. Display is superb with big screen . Very smooth to operate and light weight. So over all best purchase for price . After service for phone is very good as home delivery is offered for service free of cost. Go for it; This is surely a product that is value for money.

Let me tell you what is 'value' from my perspective.

Before shifting to Lava Agni 2, I used to have Redmi note 9 max pro, which is almost the same dimension, weight as this phone but with older hardware and a bunch of Chinese apps (because its Redmi)

This review is surely not for folks who have or are using iphones, high end phones or expecting an iPhone features in Agni 2.

My usage of mobile phone (and that's how I VALUE the mobile) is primarily to read articles, read news, watch relevant work videos, be connected on teams and outlook for work, have some simple apps for shopping, leisure (take photos, music and watching web series, WhatsApp), use for about 1-2 hrs a day, 2-4 hrs over weekend, decent battery backup and off course to make calls.

I am not a gamer or very active in social media, or into video editing, posting to channels etc.

With all this in context, my requirement was to have a mobile with a budget which is below 20k and avoid having malware, spyware (which you can guess why I am mentioning).

With my 3 days of experience here are the pros and cons that I observe:

Let's start with pros, because that's a bigger list:
- Fantastic display (called as AMOLED) with curve. Its smooth, feels awesome and looks premium.
- Amazingly fast and fluid
- Perfect experience of handling the phone. It can get too sticky with you 😜
- No blotwares and less risk of spyware.
- I could copy my files and app from old phone to this phone, so it was a seamless transition (so I am not sure if Google apps already existed or not)
- Camera quality is decent. You can only expect so much from a 50mp camera. Various filters filters which is cool. Video is manageable. If you play around with the filters it will give better results. If you are looking at authentic pics, this is not your phone.
- I liked the clock feature where bedtime theme can be set
- Built in features like preventive touch option, in display scanner, lock app option, 120 hz, lock folder option, clone app function, memory extension (RAM), 256 gb, all are jaw dropping experience for this price
- Decent sound (but mono)
- Got a basic plastic case
- Volume is high while making calls
- Fast charging (Eg: 50% in 15 min.)

CONS

- Battery drains faster than my previous phone
- 3.5 mm audio port is not there, so we can't charge and listen to songs at one go until you have c type hub. Moreover you need to carry the c type to audio converter
- Sturdy case and screen guard not found in Amazon
- List of default sound option to change ringtone or alarm not available. Strongly recommend Lava to consider this
- Gets heated up mildly (more than my previous phone)

Finally my verdict is, if you have similar requirements like mine and if that defines your value for money, just go for Lava Agni 2.
I must say that I have started liking the phone more than what I thought and much more from the time I unboxed 3 days back.
It also feels that Lava designed and made the phone keeping my needs in mind 🙂 So thanks to Lava for coming up with such a product!"

This budget-friendly smartphone has impressed me in more ways than one, and I'm thrilled to share my positive experience.

Highly recommended!; Using this phone from last two weeks so I genuinely giving my feedback

Phone look good quality of body is too good ,charging speed is good it’s 20w speed ,durability is awesome,
Front Camera is ok ,back camera is not ok
Display quality is good but touching issue little bit u will feel that disturbance while using keyboard but it’s not much irritating ,
I thought it’s not for gamers
Sound quality good
Finally this phone budget wise good I’m satisfied with this budget and the features
Can’t expect more enough in this budget; Good phone. 5G , Camera looks marvellous and stunning. Not Hanging. Can upgrade to 1TB memory. Easy to use. I think NOKIA is back.; After using for a day...!!
Build quality: A typical Nokia product. In hand feel is good. The back panel looks so much good. Looks awesome.
Display: It's doesn't look like a 720p display at all. The overall experience with a 90hz refresh rate is smooth and punchy. But content watching like videos on YouTube may feel little dull.
Camera: The 50mp back camera is like 50/50. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's average. I haven't tested the 2mp cameras. 8mp front camera is below average. Camera app has some cool features. Use GCam for a good result. Picture quality will be improved drastically especially the front camera.
Speaker: The single bottom firing speaker is loud and has good level of vocal details. But misses the bass. Overall average. It has a feature call boost volume which will increase the volume upto 10%. The earpiece is top quality. Wired earphone output is good. I've used Nokia earphones and quality is good. Also used Noise tws and got a decent output, no issues here.
Software: Clean Android 13 with some pre installed app which is uninstallable.
Overall a good phone in this price range. 5G bands only n28 and n78 available. Airtel 5G is working fine, don't know about Jio. Compass sensor is missing. I've also attached some shots taken with Nokia G42 5G. Charging the battery will take 1hr45mins from 20% to 100%.; Nice and handy with better connectivity, camera also fine for ameture people, satisfied .; While overall it's a good product two things are not satisfactory. 1) The speed of loading apps, running them is rather slow. 2) The camera doesn't capture very sharp pictures. The lenses used to be Zeiss but now it's one that gives blurred photos.; I got the phone yesterday. Everything is fine, no ads no blotware no extra apps, that all i want. Camera quality is also good. Picture colour is upto the mark. Pure android, no lag no hang, i have used almost 30+ apps at one. Don't get underrated with negative feedback. Charging is also good, value for money aslo you can get 5g mobile with under 10k and connectivity of 5g is aslo worthy. I am glad for having this phone."

1. Awesome sleek Build
2. UI is fluid
3. 120Hz refresh rate makes everything look and feel smooth (without lag whatsoever)
4. Impressive touch response
5. Spectacular haptic feedback
6. Great Battery life (lasts almost 2 days)
7. Beast performance
8. Hyper Engine is an added value to gaming fanatics (Hyper resolution, Hyper HDR and Hyper framerate)
9. Trinity Engine is equivalent to Iphones RAM and ROM management
10. SuperVOOC charge is flabbergasting'ly fast (0%-100% in ~20 mins)
11. Charger brick and cable in the box
12. Wifi 7 enabled
13. built-in screen protector is sufficient enough (although applying a 3rd party screen protector is a hassle due to it's curve edges)
14. Oneplus came back with a bang after a long time

Cons :-

1. Great camera for the price range (not like Rs. 1 lakh+ Samsung Galaxy S24 or Iphone 15)
2. Sometimes closing an app makes the whole screen go black for a moment
3. Users have seen green line after software update (haven't updated mine for the same reason)
4. Touch response is quite tricky near the Curvy edges
5. Curvy edges makes a hell lot of distraction due to reflection

Verdict :-

Highly recommended for an overall package of a true Android smartphone experience!!!; Camera captures picturesque quality photos. Battery is the real winner (lasts more than 24 hrs) along with the ultrafast charger. Curved display is fun to operate. Colors are actually good, which makes it premium brand & stand apart from other Vivo phones.; Recently purchased the OnePlus 12 and the performance, display, battery life, and camera quality is quite amazing. The display is vibrant and sharp, making watching videos and playing games a delightful experience. The battery life is quite impressive not to forget about the amazing 100w charger provided in box And the camera takes stunning photos with great detail. The phone is lightning fast and handles all my tasks with ease. Overall, satisfied with my purchase and would recommend the OnePlus 12 to anyone looking to upgrade.; TLDR; Great phone for buyers who are looking for a well-rounded phone which can do a bit of everything, but don't buy it if your top priority is the camera. I have judged the camera harshly because cameras are important in flagships.

EDIT 1: A second update addressed some of the issues in the camera and fixed it. Some of the issues still remain (like overprocessing of photos indoors) but camera performs slightly better now so I'll increase the camera rating. Kudos to OnePlus for the prompt action.

Display - 7.5/10
Camera - 7.5/10
Performance - 9/10
Software - 8/10
Battery - 9.5/10
Connectivity - 9/10

I upgraded from my OP9R to this and got a nice exchange bonus out of it. I had briefly used a Pixel 8 Pro as well, and while the software and camera were superior than the OP12, their hardware was outdated and I faced a lot of connectivity issues so I ended up returning the P8P.

Note: I will say that when it comes to the overall phone experience and my personal requirements, OnePlus 12 is better than Pixel 8 Pro in my opinion and also ₹35k cheaper.

This phone is already competitively priced so I got a good deal out of it. Here are my initial impressions -

1. ACCESSORIES: Getting a charger and a phone case in 2024 out of the box makes me really happy. The case is okay but I would recommend getting a better one. The charger is big and heavy as it's 100W.

2. DISPLAY: The display is - clarity and quality wise fantastic, and any media you play in a higher resolution will look phenomenal. The brightness is also quite ample even under full sunlight conditions. Although 4500 nits is misleading but when you access HDR content, you will witness it's not entirely a gimmick. A display this good at this price is commendable.

The display is also CURVED, which is worst thing about it. This is the first curved display phone I've used and it's a bad experience for me. The light glares on the curved parts break the immersion while watching videos or browsing, photo editing can be a pain, causes problems in copy-pasting texts, gathers a lot of dust and not to mention how they are susceptible to more damages even with a good case on. It gets worse in sunlight. It will take some getting used to but I will never like it.

3. CAMERA: Camera has good clarity (the 10-bit mode can further enhance picture quality) but is also frustrating at times. There are a lot of moments when it overexposes, over sharpens and messes up the white balance in certain parts of photos after processing. I've had to manually tweak the exposure settings to get the scenes right a lot of times. Rear camera seflies indoors, sky pictures and sceneries with a lot of dynamic range come out weird after processing sometimes. The whole point of Hasselblad tuning is that the photos should be true-to-life. Sometimes pictures come out too warm indoors. Outdoors they perform better. I have had to use the Master Mode on Auto to take some pictures so that the processing does not ruin the picture. The downside of Master Mode is that your photos will end up looking a bit bland (because there's no post-processing happening) and it does not handle dynamic ranges well.

QUICK TIP: Turn off the ProXDR mode from the inbuilt gallery settings. It exaggerates photo quality on your display but is useless outside your gallery once you upload those photos somewhere.

Night mode is okay and gets the job done but don't expect it to perform a miracle with bad lighting conditions. Portrait mode is fantastic, edge-detection is very well-tuned. The Pro mode is where this camera shines and makes the use of the camera hardware but the majority won't use it. The glass coating on the camera is very susceptible to damage because it covers a better part of your phone's back so you will need to buy a good case.

Digital zoom is not very good in my opinion considering IQOO 12 has done a much better job with it while being significantly cheaper.

Video recordings from the rear camera come out clear enough and the audio quality is also good. But when you're switching lenses for zooming in, you'll notice a bit of stutter and a slight change in the colour gradient. When you're zooming in a lot, the camera takes 3-5 seconds before registering a focus object and detecting it properly. Super stable mode works well but only with 60fps. 30fps recording mode is not that smooth, with sub-par stabilization and stutters a lot when switching lenses. These have been an ongoing issue for a few generations and one would have expected OP to resolve it by now.

Front camera is pretty average (even more disappointing indoors). It works well in daylight but indoor pictures look like they're taken from a mid-range phone. They did tune the front camera to have a wider angle which is good. Video recording from the front camera doesn't allow 60 fps but allows 4K recording now.

OP clearly needs to work in the camera department in future updates. Their camera algorithms are quite behind compared to the current industry standards even though the phone has good camera hardware.

Overall camera is okay for daily use but if it's your main priority, this phone might not be for you.

4. CONNECTIVITY AND CALL QUALITY - Did not notice any call drops, 5G works well and the person on the other end heard my voice very loud and clear. Bluetooth and WIFI are working well.

IR blaster works but don't expect it to be compatible with every device. Gets the job done regardless and a super convenient feature that I wish more phones had these days.

5. BATTERY AND CHARGING - It is fantastic. Can last a full day on medium to heavy usage, and 1.5 days on light usage. They have also introduced battery health management features which is an added bonus. I had to try really hard to drain the battery completely.

Charging time is 25-27 mins after full drainage. The smart charging feature to conserve battery health over time is a nice addition. Haven't used the wireless charging or reverse wireless charging so wouldn't be able to comment on it.

My current SOT shows up as almost 9 hrs and 1d 5 hrs since last charge with 7% charge left. Battery is crazy good as you can see.

6. PERFORMANCE: Top-notch performance, phone feels super fast and snappy. Got only slightly warm during gaming (I played CoDM), continuous camera operations and charging. Their new cooling system is proving to be very good.

Read and write speeds, app installations are also super fast.

7. SOFTWARE: Oxygen OS 14 has some very good parts (quick launch, smart sidebar, file docker etc), and some bad parts. There are some Android 14 features that have not been implemented correctly (why do I have to manually set refresh rates for all the apps even after selecting the high refresh rate option?) or are absent (where are the lock screen customisations?). OOS14 is still proving to be a good experience for me overall.

I have not encountered any bugs in my day to day usage and every operation on the phone has been seamless so far. Honestly, I expected OP12 to be quite buggy at launch but I'm happy that they are learning from their mistakes.

OP has managed to give great features in an extremely competitive price and I would say I'm mostly happy with my purchase (except maybe the camera). China models will see AI features soon and I hope global launches follow the suit.; Despite products available in the market at a cheaper price of the same specifications but I will say quality needs the price , this is Pro at quality and performance both
Excellent battery backup
Super smooth performance and multitasking
Ultra fast charging
No lagging in internet super connectivity; Camera is fabulous. Battry backup for 2 days almost. Overall phone is value for money.; It's a Beast... If you are trying to buy something that's sturdy. This is it. Great processor, Nice Camera Quality. Superb Display. Quick Charging...; Very easily get scratches; I used to have iphones, recently used poco phone for 2 years! OnePlus 12 impressed me so much! Software is so fast and smooth! Brightness is good, so I can see it well under Dubai sun! Battery life is good, has ultra fast charging! I really enjoy it! Highly recommend!!; Very good hardware and software is so fast and smooth and a high quality camera , just amazing phone; I have owned so many phones over the time and all of them were android phones, confidently I can say, this is the best in whats known as flagship category. In the beginning I was a little sceptical because the phone has no local dealer or any service centers, but after using the phone I realized that it's a great marriage between hardware and software. The only pitfall I can think of which fuelled my old scepticism, is the screen protector which was installed and was making the fingerprint sensor not responding properly, but after removing it, it worked like a charm, so my guess the screen protector wasn't a good quality or wasn't installed properly.; OnePlus is best mobile; سريع الشحن ماشاء الله"

**Pros:**

1. **5G Connectivity:** The inclusion of 5G support future-proofs the device, ensuring faster download and upload speeds as 5G networks become more prevalent.

2. **Powerful Performance:** Equipped with a high-performance chipset and ample RAM, the Galaxy M15 5G delivers smooth multitasking and gaming experiences without lag.
But sometimes little lag while heavy use and in games like BGMI.

3. **Impressive Display:** The device boasts a vibrant and immersive AMOLED display with rich colors and deep blacks, making it ideal for multimedia consumption and gaming.

4. **Long-lasting Battery:** With a large battery capacity, the Galaxy M15 5G offers excellent battery life, easily lasting through a full day of heavy usage. But you will get this without charger in the box . That a bad thing

5. **Versatile Camera System:** The device features a versatile camera setup, including multiple lenses for capturing a variety of scenes with average details & qualities.

**Cons:**

1. **Plastic Build:** Despite its premium features, the Galaxy M15 5G sports a plastic build, which may not feel as premium as devices with glass or metal constructions.

2. **Bloatware:** Like many Samsung devices, the Galaxy M15 5G comes preloaded with a suite of apps and services, some of which may be unnecessary and take up valuable storage space.

3. **Average camera Performance:** While the camera performs well in most lighting conditions, its performance in low-light scenarios may not be as impressive compared to other devices with dedicated night mode features.

Overall, the Samsung Galaxy M15 5G offers a compelling package with its 5G connectivity, powerful average performance, and impressive display. However, its plastic build, lack of performance may deter some potential buyers. Nonetheless, for users seeking a mid-range device with 5G capabilities, the Galaxy M15 5G is worth considering.; It's an awful phone. Please do not buy it. The touch screen is terrible. Have to touch 5-6 times sometimes for it to work, it's very frustrating. The screen flickers every now and then. The camera is average at best. The speaker is bad. And its quite heavy. I really regret it. I'm a person who hates to change the phone, i miss my old phone even more now The only good thing is that it charges fast and battery lasts a fair amount if time. Am gonna exchange it as soon as possible.; I got the one with 8GB RAM. Display is great. 4 Years of OS updates from Samsung. And Great Battery Life. Camera is also Nice. Nothing to complain here. It's been 1 month & I think It has been a great purchase 👌🏼.; best battery life and 5G, better performance, good display , average camera , bad sound and build, final verdict - go for it , if in exchange or offer.; Picture quality, sound quality, everything thing is beyond expectations in this price, charging is moderate speed but battery backup is better than any other in the segment. Phone is a little heavy due to large battery. Camera quality is reasonable. Software support also given upto Android 18 and another 1 year for security updates.; ; Worst product
Sound quality is not so much better, hanging too much, backside panel is plastic after 1 or 2 hours it will be heating, photos okay okay, in that budget, the device is just for basic usage..
I want to share the experience..
I have ordered on summer sales, and they said the free charger is provided, but the charger is not present in the delivery package, i have contacted customer care several times but each time they are saying it is my mistake to order, they are not accepting the mistake from their side, at one time the customer care associate listened the issue and has transferred to technical team, and this team transfered to the specialised team, and after 3 to 5 minutes they cut the call,this is all repeated for several times."

Excellent value for money mobile. Good Camera, Good battery life of full 2 days+ and more with moderate usage without gaming. Display quality is good but not as good as other Samsung super AMOLED. Display brightness in direct sunlight is low and may be problematic to see in direct sunlight. Camera photo capture sometimes feel little slow, other apps processing is MODERATELY FAST and NO LAG and NO HANG, VERY SMOOTH PERFORMANCE except gamimg because I did not do gaming in this phone. Photos have good moderate quality details in good lighting conditions. To get full 2 days or more than 2 days battery life, changing the default frequency to 60 Hz from 90Hz may be very helpful from the settings menu. It has Automatic Call Recording option inbuilt so you can record all calls without any external app.
Overall M14 5G 6GB 128GB is an excellent value for money 5G mobile phone with 13 5G bands with very good 5G connectivity.
I would have called this a perfect value for money mobile if Samsung had given its Super AMOLED display in this mobile.; Before settling on the Samsung M14 5G, I was considering three different models: the Redmi 12 5G, Moto G54 5G, and M14. Through my research, I found that the G54 had heating issues and the Redmi 12 had camera issues. As a general user who was looking for a good phone with good battery life and good call quality, I ultimately chose the M14.

In terms of network capabilities, this phone works best on 5G/4G and supports 13 bands on 5G, VOWIFI, and has 4G aggression which works seamlessly. The only feature missed was VONR. One feature that I found particularly useful is voice focus, which cuts background noise perfectly( particularly when you are train or noisy environment). The phone also has dedicated slots for SIM and SDCard.

Battery backup is amazing and can sustain for at least 2 days no matter how you use it. However, the camera is average and the rear camera is worse than the front camera. The Samsung UI is very good and supports dual apps (dual WhatsApp), and RAM management is good, though most of the time only 2GB of RAM is free. If you have a Samsung TV, this phone works flawlessly with it.

The phone comes with the latest Android 13 out of the box, and Samsung guarantees updates for OS and security updates which is a plus. The speaker is loud enough for calls and listening to YouTube videos. There are no bloatware apps, though there are a few that can be uninstalled.

One major con is that the phone does not come with a charger inside the box, only a C to C type cable. I ordered a 20W boat charger which works perfectly but comes at an additional cost. The biggest con I see is the display, which is very bad in outdoor conditions even when set to full brightness. If you are an outdoor person, I would recommend avoiding this phone. The phone's appearance is very basic, and the back looks very plasticky (can be covered with a case). There is no punch hole camera.

Overall, if you are someone who makes long phone calls and wants a phone with good battery life and call quality, the Samsung M14 5G is a great choice.

Update 2: I came to know that 3rd camera which is a 2MP depth does nothing here, its better to go for F14 than this as you can save approx 1k instead of buying( may be you can buy a samsung 25 w fast charger with that money), all others specs are the same. The phone feels very heavy on hand mind it.
Update 2:
Just got the android 14 and one UI 6 update. Got additional features like VONR and 3 more shooting modes in camera. Phone is smoother than earlier. Worth the investment.; I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed. Samsung has managed to strike a perfect balance between performance, affordability, and 5G capability with this smartphone. As a tech enthusiast, I have used various smartphones, but the Galaxy M14 5G stands out for its exceptional features and budget-friendly price. Here's an in-depth review based on my experience.

Design and Build Quality (5/5):
The Galaxy M14 5G boasts a sleek and stylish design. The phone feels comfortable in hand, thanks to its ergonomic build. The slim profile and lightweight design make it easy to carry around. The build quality is impressive, considering the price point, and the device feels durable.

Display (4.5/5):
The 90 Hz 6.6-inch LCD display offers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and excellent contrast. The Full HD+ resolution provides sharp and detailed visuals, making videos and games look stunning. The only slight drawback is the brightness under direct sunlight, but it's manageable.

Performance (5/5):
Powered by a capable Exynos 1330 Octa-core processor and 4/6GB of RAM, the Galaxy M14 5G delivers smooth and lag-free performance. Multitasking is a breeze, and apps load quickly. Gaming performance is impressive, handling graphic-intensive games with ease. The 5G connectivity ensures faster download and streaming speeds, making it future-ready.

Camera (4.5/5):
The camera setup on the M14 5G is commendable for its price range. The 50MP main sensor captures detailed and sharp photos in well-lit conditions. The 2MP ultra-wide lens is great for capturing landscapes and group shots. The 2MP depth sensor provides good bokeh effect in portrait mode. The low-light performance is decent, producing usable photos with minimal noise.

Battery Life (5/5):
Equipped with a 6000mAh battery, the Galaxy M14 5G offers impressive battery life. With moderate usage, the phone easily lasts a full day, even with 5G connectivity enabled. The optimized software ensures efficient battery management, allowing users to enjoy extended usage without constantly worrying about charging.

Software and Features (4.5/5):
The phone runs on Samsung's One UI Core 5.1 based on Android 13, providing a clean and user-friendly experience. Samsung's software enhancements, coupled with regular updates, enhance the overall user experience. The phone supports Face Unlock and a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, both of which work reliably.

Value for Money (5/5):
In terms of value for money, the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G is a winner. It offers a feature-packed experience usually found in higher-end smartphones at a fraction of the cost. The inclusion of 5G connectivity at this price point is a game-changer, making it an ideal choice for budget-conscious consumers looking for future-proof technology.

Conclusion:
In summary, the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G is a stellar budget smartphone that exceeds expectations. It combines a sleek design, vibrant display, powerful performance, capable camera setup, excellent battery life, and 5G connectivity, all at an affordable price. Whether you're a casual user or a tech enthusiast, this phone delivers exceptional value for money. I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G to anyone in search of a reliable, feature-packed, and future-ready smartphone without breaking the bank.; It is a good phone i've been using it for more than a year now it is decent for gaming like it can run bgmi at a constant 30 fps because it has an exynos 1330 processor but it is perfect for multitasking and web browsing due to its 5g compatability. It looks beautiful in its berry blue colour and it has a super fast charging of 25v. Its camera is perfect for this range and the stability of this decice is also good ."

1. Superb design
2. Good Ram and ROM
3. Good camera if not Superb
4. Good screen if not best
5. No bloatware and stock android
6. And finally, Good battery with day day performance as my wife don't play game.

I am truly happy to share that this phone has exceeded my expectations in every corner. Actually, I was little skeptical about the screen as it is only HD plus, however to my surprise, it is best HD plus display I have every seen. Not much difference. Camera also exceeded my expectations, though little improvement is required in white exposure. And surprisingly, it is from indian brand Lava. Long live Lava!! Keep doing great. I am owing samsung but I swear If Lava keeps doing this, my next phone will be from Lava. Everyone in my family and friends praised this. My true words.

Few things which was a true surprise as I didn't expect at all in this price segment:-

1. Haptics (best means best, even better than premium segment phones)

2. Screen color reproduction is sometimes equal to that of Amoled, though not always. But believe me HD plus display will not be a regret.

3. awesome Ram management and UFC 2.1 will definitely make your feel of using a premium phones

4. Looks - not even 25 to 30k phone will come near to this.

Though, some cons are also there-

1. Slow charger - takes around 3 hours to charge battery, though battery backup is Superb.

2. Video lags in 2k 60 FPS, though work fine in 1080 60 fps. This really requires efforts from Lava as it is possible to improve via update.

3. Camera white exposure and portrait mode requires improvements.

4. Background stream - in review videos, option of background stream like YouTube is shown, however in reality, I am unable to see this. Please get this done with an update.

5. Last but not least - place of fingerprint sensor or power key sometimes feel uncomfortable for new user. Though, not an issue after some days use.

If the above issues are possible to resolve, please resolve Lava.

No phone can come close to this pure stock android experience in this price range.

However, the way you have made a come back in indian market is Superb. All the best my indian company. Keep doing great.; For the price, it's good comparatively to other phones but sometimes behave abnormally. When you are on a phone call, the mute button gets activated accidentally (as many other customers complaint that their mic stops working during a phone call, mute is the real reason and therefore its location should be changed).
Camera is good but not that great. Display is average but 5G speed is awesome even when it's not 5G+, can easily compete or even beat my 5G+ moto g54.

Battery backup is also good. Charger heats sometimes.

Overall, Value for money!!!; Very good product. As of know i have experienced good voice quality in call, and internet speed is also no problem. screen is also very good , smooth working.
Product shipped with appropriate back cover which is quite good, it saved my time for searching.
overall as of know it is very good phone for the price.; After using it for sometimes i think it's a good configured smartphone.
Camera is good if you're are coming from low end hardware to this phone it's worth it. although low light photo will be little hazy but it tolerable if you really want to take good picture use pro mode customize your own setting.
Battery life after heavy usage on 2gb per day data it's gives more than 8 hours runtime.
All application run smoothly except some custom app like redmi weather app(didn't work). network is really good in it everything run smoothly but i don't like the launcher it's nice light weight but it's missing options like not allowing play store from creating desktop/homescreen icon, miss those little light indicator on old smartphone, missing option to change font(pure hatred for default google font) .
display is nice but dont like jelly feeling when i am scrolling.
charger is normal charger ,best it don't heat up like other company (redmi) charger. The charger cable is little lose from usb-A side but not bad.; Affordable and good quality phone, photo quality is also good, smooth working; Looks Premium, value for money. Camera is not that good but it is extremely good at Gaming and processing Multiple Apps at once. Go for it over redmi or Tecno; Camera is superb only rest of things of not good. Like they provide 8 GB Ram but battery level drain in few time 30 minutes 8 percent drain. No fast charge."

Cons: *no expandable memory slot
*Performing of camera in night was poor

Slow charging: it takes 40-50 minutes to full charge, which is okay for 67-watt charge. But (If we use the handset while charging) it can take 1.5 - 2 hours for full charge. according to accubattery it can charge upto speed of 33watts as peak and mostly 480 Mah/hr speed (measured while using the handset)

Battery Drain: mobile can withstand upto 12-24hrs fr regular use and 4-5 hrs fr heavy use such as gaming and noted no heating issue (only warmness noted while gaming & charging the handset); Premium mobile on Budget price, more than 70 apps (including my work apps) installed, also tried parallel apps, truly amazing performance...

Lucky I bought this mobile, regardless of fake reviews...

Note: No cons I found on this mobile till now, go for it, totally worth it...

Compare this with iPhone on any showroom if possible, you'll still love this one....

POXO X6 - Best of the Best....; Wifi not working since purchased, battery is draining too fast, mx player lags while playing videos, please don't buy this faulty phone.; Value of money. Good phone in this price segment. Battery life is so good. 7 s gen 2 soc is also is good.; Zakasssss; The phone is good for this price range but it heats and the battery drains fast; Google Map App is not working; Melhor custo x benefício nessa faixa de preço.; Comproi o modelo X6 Poco para meu filho de 15 anos. Não só ele, como eu também, ficamos encantados com o Xiaomi!!! Esse aparelho, realmente, é incrível!!! Conseguimos transportar todos os dados e apps do aparelho velho (samsung) para o novo celular com um sucesso incrível!!! A duração e carregamento da bateria são exatamente como a promessa do modelo. Já veio com uma capinha, o único trabalho foi encontrar uma película nas lojas, acabamos encontrando uma do X4 que ficou perfeita! O modelo Xiaome superou tanto nossas expecativas que em breve vou adquirir o meu, e espero que na AMAZON esteja com o preço acessível, como esteve nesta compra!!! A aparência física do X6 é encantadora, muito brilhosa, parece de vidro! O modelo já veio com dezenas de apss, uma riqueza de opções!!! Ah, e a entrega foi realmente dentro do prazo!!! Super recomendo o produto e a loja.; Ótimo, surpreso pela qualidade do produto!
Só esquentou um pouco, não sei se é normal da primeira vez que liga, no mais é isso ele é otimo!; absolutamente nada a reclamar, tudo veio perfeitamente como deveria vir, entrega extremamente rápida, além de vir lacrado, algo que poucas se importam em manter. caso queiram comprar, recomendo a MetalGear Tech além de qualquer outra, pois ele não apenas dizem, como realmente trabalham apenas com o modelo global, inversamente como certas empresas que dizem trabalhar apenas com esse modelo, mas enviam a p***a do modelo indiano, com funções faltando e carregador horrível; Gostei do preço, da capacidade de armazenamento."

I would say this mobile is one of the best and value for money mobile in this price segment.

1)Performance:

The mobile performs seemlessly in all the tasks it went through.

I Played bgmi and other games in high settings and the phone handed it very well.

But I also faced heating issue with higher setting, which is common but it didn't affect it's performance and few fps drops

2) Display:

One word to describe, awesome.

The colour are pretty accurate, bright and the haptics are great which feels like the phone is communicating.

I heard from other comments, the display is not good under the sun, yeah that's true but it's is still visible to use the phone under the direct sun light without any problem.

3) Charging and Battery standby:

It takes 30-35 minutes to full charge, that's pretty great for a phone at this price range.

It takes 20 minutes to charge the phone to 80%, and I would also recommend you to charge it till 80 by turning on the option so the battery life last long.

And about the backup, it solidly last more than a day for normal use and when u play games it drains faster.
U can play for around 3hrs with 80% charge.

Camera:

It's performance is pretty amazing, I won't it is the great but it does it's job.

The colors, skin tone, background accurate and especially the portraits, really perfect. The edge cutting and blurring the background are just top-notch.

The videos are stable(as u can see in the video), capture the exact colour, retailing is good and they are not noisly and the low light videos are good not too good.

And the low light photos are decent, but the photo from night mode are absolutely amazing and it's retailing is good and selfies are also nice

About the macro and ultra wide:

To be practical we won't use it in our day to day like.

If ur need is good and decent photos and videos just for it u, will love it.

If u want a better camera and u are buying it only for camera and features, this won't be right choice.

4) Connectivity:

I haven't faced any issues with the connectivity till now but from my experience, it's is up to the mark.

I am using Airtel with a 4g sim and I got upto 270mbs speed.

And the Bluetooth connectivity is amazing.

5) Case and conclusion:

The case they are giving is rigid and the in hand feel is good. They are not slippery and does it's job.

To conclude, you won't get a better phone at this price range, with lot of features, performance and a great camera. I would granty u, it will a hell of a experience.

The phone does as advertised.
Pros
1. Call quality Excellent. A phone is a phone after all and I like the voice clarity in this phone.
2. Apps: no crashes
3. Transfer of data from old phone Done with no trouble with Smart Switch. Whatsapp data transfer was quick with 5G network.
4. Screen Brightness good for outdoors
5. Battery still 20 % remaining after first charging 4 days ago.
Cons
1. The screen does not go completely black as in AMOLED displays.
2. The 5G is at best a experimental network. Jio says unlimited 5g. I have seen download speed upto 232 Mbps but uplaod speed is less than 7 Mbps, but the main problem is not speed. The battery starts to drain like anything once I connect to 5g network (say 5% in about 10 minutes while updating aps in playstotre). Please read the article: Samsung phone battery drains quickly on 5G service. This is true for any 5G phone. Also the phone warms up during connecting to 5G network and heavy downloading. So I have kept the power saving switch on and switch it off when I need to connect to 5g services.
3. Bloatwares are holding on tightly. I will have to find ways to eradicate them.
Overall I find this phone working nicely, so 5 Stars. Bought it for Rs13990.; Camera average.Othervise good; ; I am writing to express my disappointment with the recent purchase of the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G (Berry Blue, 4GB, 128GB) from Amazon, as well as the poor after-sales service I received.

On March 25th, 2024, I ordered the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G from Amazon, and it was promptly delivered on March 26th, 2024. However, from the moment I started using the device, I encountered several issues.

Firstly, the phone frequently freezes and becomes unresponsive, making it extremely frustrating to use. Additionally, the device overheats both during regular usage and while charging, which raises concerns about its safety and reliability.

On March 28th, 2024, I contacted Amazon customer care to request assistance and arrange for servicing or a replacement. However, I was extremely disappointed by the response I received. Instead of offering a solution or arranging for assistance, I was simply directed to contact the brand's service center.

This lack of support and assistance from Amazon's customer service team is unacceptable, especially considering that the phone was purchased directly from Amazon and delivered just two days prior. As a loyal customer, I expected better service and support from Amazon.

In light of these issues and the poor after-sales service experience, I strongly advise against purchasing Samsung products, especially from Amazon's online platform. The lack of quality control and support undermines the trust and confidence consumers have in both the brand and the retailer.

I hope that Amazon takes this feedback seriously and takes steps to improve its after-sales service processes to ensure a better experience for its customers in the future.; Nice mobile battery is very high I recommended this product; Product is on an average. Battery performance is very good but it's charging takes more than 2hours to complete 100%.
From day 1, during the charging heating issue occurs.
Icons shown in this product looks like it suits for aged persons.; product in this price range is good but it has preinstalled so many apps which we don't use generally. I had to install it all one by one. Setting up this device initially was a hectic task and this sometimes gets very laggy. Would suggest to spend some more and get a good phone.; "

Firstly, let's talk about ANR Mobiles. Their customer service was top-notch, providing helpful advice and assistance throughout the purchasing process.

Connectivity and Display:
The inclusion of 5G connectivity is a notable feature, providing faster download speeds and improved connectivity. The display quality is good but may not match the vividness and sharpness of premium smartphone counterparts.

Value Analysis:
In terms of value, the Galaxy F54 5G offers a balanced proposition. The design, software, and battery life make it a compelling choice for those seeking a reliable and aesthetically pleasing device. However, users with specific demands in performance or camera capabilities may find more specialized options in different market segments.; Please be aware when ordering this phone the package comes open with seal broken. The phone looked new and the emei codes matched hence kept it. Upon use for few days this phone temprature touches 40 degrees Celcius and feels warm compare to my previous phone that runs at 36 degrees. There is a risk of overheating with phone so please check as soon as phone is delivered with CPU monitor app. I am not sure if my phone has this issue or the F54 series in general has the problem. Other phone functions are fine. Camera is good.; These are just first impressions.

Camera : to be tested
Battery backup: to be tested
Screen: Awesome, super Amoled so tip notch.
I got it for 22500 so happy with the purchase.; Valueable purchase; Product is very good.No heating issue even in 46 to 47 degree Celsius.But receive damaged product back is open and a scratch on phone screen. I can feel it just tough there; Build quality is too lower and phone has heating problem also
I purchased samsung only for knox security but otherwise on this price it's not worth it and not value for money

Battery and storage is good
Samsung should improve its quality in camera and body and Exynos processor of samsung should be repaired because it has heating issues; NOT SOWING IN WARRANTY DEATEL AMEZON WHY?

Overall, the iQOO 12 sets a new standard for flagship smartphones, offering a winning combination of performance, style, and innovation. If you're in the market for a powerhouse device that doesn't compromise on quality, the iQOO 12 is definitely worth considering.; I recently caught wind of iQOO's latest flagship release, the iQOO 12, and after extensive research, I took the plunge and purchased this device just two days ago. Let me share my experience with you.

First and foremost, the camera setup on the iQOO 12 is nothing short of remarkable. Boasting a triple camera configuration of 50+50+64MP, the pictures captured are not only vivid but also showcase a unique and distinctive style that sets it apart from other iQOO models. Even compared to my sister's more expensive phone, the iQOO 12 outshines with its superior camera quality. I am genuinely delighted and satisfied with the camera performance.

The design of the iQOO 12 is another standout feature. The metal sides give it a premium feel, and the device's grip is both comfortable and secure. The impressive build quality is evident, making it a pleasure to hold and use.

The user interface is clean and intuitive, contributing to an overall positive user experience. Navigating through the device is a breeze, adding to my satisfaction with the iQOO 12.

In terms of battery life, I am pleased with the performance so far. Although the charging time is approximately 25 minutes for a full charge, the endurance of the battery makes it bearable, as I don't find myself needing to charge frequently. A small trade-off for extended usage.

Gaming on the iQOO 12 is a delight. I tried Call of Duty, and the smooth touch response, fast loading times, and immersive vibrations on kills left me thoroughly impressed. The device delivers a seamless gaming experience that enhances the overall satisfaction of owning this flagship phone.

Overall, I consider the iQOO 12 a great purchase, especially for those looking for an exceptional gaming, multimedia, and camera experience within a budget of 50k. While there might be some software experience quirks, the device's performance in gaming, multimedia consumption, and photography make it a worthy investment that won't leave you disappointed. If you're in the market for a feature-packed smartphone, the iQOO 12 is a solid choice 💯😊😊; Using Iqoo 12 Alpha 512/16GB variant since a week.
Camera is outstanding, phone operating performance is too smooth, network & data speed is awesome, data transfer is unbelievably outstanding, display is too good. Here I will rate individuals:

Rear camera : 10/10
Front camera : 7/10
Display : 10/10
Speakers : 9/10
Network & Data : 10/10
Wireless connectivity: 9/10
Data transfer : 10/10 (Both wired & wireless)
Build quality: As of now it seem strong
OS : 7/10 (OS side improvement required a little bit, but you won't find issues though in routine)

The phone stand different because of few following things which less discussed. It has WiFi 7 & UFS4.0, both makes data transfer wired & wirelss in smooth manner, There is no phone in this price can do this. Camera is really magical, normal, telephoto, portrait works really well. Also, OIS in video recording works really awesome, it has horizontal lock in OiS which records steady portrait video even if camera rotated 360 degree. Photos are well in low light too which you can't expect in this budget flagships. If you are about to purchase entry level DSLR along with phone, this phone can serve for both except few high end requirements. Front camera is okay or can say good if proper loght is there, Don't expect Vivo selfie feel in this. Charging speed is magical, it takes 30 minutes from 10% to 100%. There are some minor software issues are there which they are listening & working on too so no worries about it, they can resolve them in upcoming updates.

I suggest to check all detailed technical specifications before purchasing as this is my personal experience review with my expectations. This is my first phone with such budget and I'm satisfied well for what i paid.

Note : Few users may have reported battery drain and heating. I can say high network variations & constant heavy processing in CPU & GPU can make it, but as of now I've not faced either. If you use phone in well manner, it won't disappoint.; Got phone today. Very much impressed with the delivery by amazon. Phone is awesome. Camera , Performance, Gaming, display, charging everything is good . Value for money 💜. Just go for it"

Camera quality is really good & display is highly responsive & fast enough. 6000 mah 🔋 life is really good. I usually don't play games so gamers hav to look into other reviews. Satisfied with this product. Go ahead.; The UI and camera is awesome in the device, display is not like other bright Samsung panels, it is average quality, battery is 6000 MHz but it is draining fast in 5g usage. In real life 1 day battery backup you can expect, charging speed is little slow with 25w charger, Samsung should do better in their fast charging department like other brands, considering 25k price range the phone is good not great, but the main pros are camera, UI, software update, brand quality cons are weak cheapset, heating issue, low battery backup, lack of brightness which feels like this is not an amoled display of Samsung.; Best phone in budget best camera 60 fps battery life also good; Battery drains so fast
bad performance

it will be charge twice in a day
heting problem
too much problem in this phone
plese don't buy these phone total wastage of money; Good; The phone is good camera wise,look wise

But it has severe overheating problem after few minutes of usage; Samsung product is undoubtedly most durable. However they should not stop giving adapter with their product as it will create additional burden on customer pocket; As someone who values both affordability and functionality in a smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy F54 has been a pleasant surprise. While it may not boast the latest bells and whistles of flagship models, it more than makes up for it with its solid performance and practical features.

One of the standout aspects of the Galaxy F54 is its impressive battery life. With its large battery capacity, I found myself easily getting through a full day of moderate to heavy usage without needing to reach for the charger. This longevity is particularly beneficial for users who rely heavily on their smartphones for work or entertainment on the go.

In terms of performance, the Galaxy F54 holds its own for everyday tasks such as web browsing, social media, and light gaming. The combination of a capable processor and ample RAM ensures smooth multitasking without noticeable lag or slowdowns. While it may not be the most powerful device on the market, it certainly gets the job done without any major hiccups.

The design of the Galaxy F54 is sleek and modern, with slim bezels and a vibrant display that makes content consumption a pleasure. While the build may lean towards plastic to keep costs down, it still feels sturdy and well-made in hand.

However, there are a few areas where the Galaxy F54 could improve. The camera performance, while adequate for casual photography, falls short compared to higher-end models, especially in low-light conditions. Additionally, the absence of certain premium features such as wireless charging or water resistance may be a downside for some users.

Overall, the Samsung Galaxy F54 is a solid choice for budget-conscious consumers who prioritize functionality and battery life. Whether you're a student, a professional, or simply someone looking for a reliable smartphone without breaking the bank, the Galaxy F54 delivers a compelling package that ticks all the right boxes."

Good battery 🔋; Video quality may be improved; Good phone; First time charged but didnt charge above 80%. No refund available but replacement procedure is horrible.; All Mobile companies bost and focus about the camera, screen smoothness, CPU, RAM etc, but very mobile phone companies and models focus on the network signal strength that they provide.
Based on my experience, Realme phones provide good signal strength, Realme 11 is the master in providing excellent network and receptive signal strength.

Thanks to its Antenna Array Matrix 2.0 and DAT smart technology.
I am not sure why Realme is not advertising about this, it's great competetive advantage.

You may be getting better camera, better screen phones but you will become fan of this phone for the network strength that it provides.

I highly recommend this phone whoever is looking for good mobile signal (either data or call quality), especially the hotspot it provides is seamless. Network speed is brilliant.

Apart from the network, I liked below:
1. Very fast charging and battery will last for 1.5 days
2.

From its sleek design to its impressive performance, this device has become an indispensable tool in my daily life.

Design and Build Quality:
The design is both modern and ergonomic. Its slim profile and premium materials make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.

Display:
The display is stunning. Whether I'm streaming videos, browsing the web, or playing games, the vibrant colors and sharp resolution never fail to impress.

Performance:
Powered by a robust processor and ample RAM, delivers snappy performance across the board. Apps launch quickly, multitasking is smooth, and even demanding tasks like gaming and photo editing are handled with ease. I've experienced no lag or slowdown, even when running multiple apps simultaneously.

Battery Life:
One of the standout features is its impressive battery life. Even with heavy usage, including streaming videos, browsing social media, and taking photos throughout the day, I consistently get through a full day on a single charge. The fast-charging capability is also a game-changer.

Camera:
The camera is nothing short of phenomenal. Whether I'm capturing landscapes, portraits, or close-up shots, the image quality is consistently excellent. Plus, the front-facing camera is great for selfies and video calls.

Overall Impressions:
In conclusion, the IQOO Z7 PRO has proven itself to be a standout device in the crowded smartphone market. With its premium design, top-notch performance, impressive battery life, and versatile camera system, it ticks all the boxes for what I look for in a mobile phone. Whether you're a casual user or a power user, the IQOO Z7 PRO is sure to impress. Highly recommended.; After using the device for exactly 7 days here's what I found -

Starting first with the design and build quality, the device is quite the looker. It's very thin and lightweight and the curved edges make it very comfortable to hold on for longer periods.
Also the glass sandwich built feels premium.

Next coming to display, the 120 hz curved amoled panel is in one word, splendid. It offers an immersive viewing experience with buttery smooth output. It also supports up to 1300 nits of peak brightness which helps viewing in direct sunlight.

Now, when you buy a IQOO device you don't have to worry about the performance. It shares the typical IQOO dna and is powered by MediaTek dimensity 7200. The processor is very capable in running daily tasks and graphic intensive games. I am not much of a hardcore gamer but so far what I have tested I'm impressed. Games like BGMI, COD, Genshin Impact runs smoothly in this device with good graphic settings. IQOO also has done a job in cooling the processor, it barely gets hot while gaming.

Next coming to camera, it has a 64 megapixel rear sensor which offers very good photos in daylight as well as night time. And the 16 megapixel front sensor is good too. The rear sensor can do 4k 30fps video recording and the front is locked at 1080p 30fps. Now, I am not that much of a camera guy, watching a camera review of this device will surely give you a better idea.

After that I would like to share my thoughts on the battery and charging department. I was a little concerned about the 4600mah battery capacity and the 120hz display combo but surprisingly the battery holds up pretty well. I get easily a whole day of usage with 6-7 hours of screen on time which also includes gaming. The 66w charging adaptor charges the device from 0 to 100 in about 55 minutes which I believe is pretty good.

Coming to network and connectivity, I haven't really got the opportunity to test the 5G connectivity as my local area does no not have 5G network. But 4G plus career aggregation is very constant and it offers good uploading and downloading speeds.

The last thing to talk is about software. The device comes with the latest Funtouch OS 13 based on Android 13 and IQOO has promised 2 years of OS and 3 years of security patches which is decent.
Personally I don't like the Funtouch OS much. I am coming from OneUI and compared to that this OS feels a little bit less lively. The animations are fluid and it also has all the necessary features but it needs more polishing. Do note I haven't faced any bugs in the software but there are a few advertisements which you can turn off and then it becomes a very clean experience. The software experience completely varies from user to user so you might not be bothered by it at well. I just hope the brand polishes their UI more.

Coming to compromises, it only has three which in my case is not much of an issue. It has an avarage vibration motor which doesn't offer flagship like experience. This device comes with a mono speaker which is decent. I'm coming from a device with a single speaker so it doesn't bother me as such. Also instead of the 2mp macro sensor a telephoto or ultrawide angle lens would have been highly appreciated.

In conclusion, it can be said that it is a very good overall package if you can get it at 22k with the card offers. But for 24k it could've been better. It misses a few corners which would have made it perfect under 25k. I hope this review helps you to take a better purchasing decision."

This mobile touch Working very smooth. Value of money; Pros -
1. 256gb + 4gb configuration
2. Decent performance
3. Looks stunning
4. Battery backup is ok but can be optimized with update
5. Above average speaker
6. Camera in daylight or in bright environment is acceptable
7. The provided case is really good.
8. 360 degree flashlight is cool
9. Display's viewing angles and overall quality is satisfactory

Cons -
1. FEW BASIC FEATURES LIKE DOUBLE TAP TO TURN ON AND OFF SCREEN, 3 FINGER SCREENSHOT ETC ARE MISSING WHICH IS VERY ANNOYING. THESE FEATURES ARE VERY BASIC AND I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW COME ITEL REMOVED IT AND WHY?
2. LOW LIGHT CAMERA PERFORMACE IS REALLY BAD.
3. PLAYSTORE AND YOUTUBE ARE NOT PROPERLY OPTIMIZED BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU ARE JUST SCROLLING IN THEM, THE PHONE STUTTERS AND HANGS WHICH NEEDS TO BE FIXED.
4. BATTERY BACKUP AUTOMATICALLY GETS REDUCED SOMETIMES WHICH ALSO NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

ITEL TEAM REALLY NEEDS TO PROVIDE ONE UPDATE ASAP TO FIX THESE MENTIONED DRAWBACKS BECAUSE SUCH BASIC FEATURES IF ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY OR ARE MISSING THEN PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO RECOMMEND THIS DEVICE TO OTHERS WITH FULL CONFIDENCE.

IF THEY FIX THESE ISSUES, THIS DEVICE WILL LITERALLY KILL THE 6-8K BUDGET SEGMENT. PLEASE FIX THEM ASAP.

(Please note all these pros and cons are mentioned considering the killer price at which it comes); I like this is mobile, this mobile desgin is very good, camera quality is too good, back side look is very cool & fabulous, bettery performence is very good, sound quality is also very good. This mobile touch Working very smooth. Value of money; Overall I am not happy with the performance of this iTel A70 moble phone.

Pros:
1. Very affordable
2. ROM and RAM are more than any comparable mobile of same price.
3. Screen resolution is quite good
4. Sound volume is okay though there is only one speaker at the bottom.
5. Overall build quality is good.

Cons:
1. Network connectivity is poor
2. Screen brightness is low compared to other models.
3. Has only one microphone, so cannot record in stereo.

I had applied for a return/refund for the product, but came to know that, as per their policy, it cannot be returned. They arranged for an inspection of the mobile to verify the problems at my place. An inspection agent called me up and asked me to provide the OTP which had been sent to me in my email. The email instructed me as follows - ""Please share the Job Start PIN with Service expert only after they arrive at your location. Do not share over call"". But the agent kept insisting for the PIN on call, saying that he would make sure that I get a refund. I finally gave him the OTP which was a big mistake. He made a report to Amazon that the issue had been resolved. This is a fraud being commited by these agents, I request everyone NOT TO PROVIDE PIN/OTP ON CALL. I am now stuck with a sub-standard mobile phone which I can't return for a better product. It is a shame that Amazon is happily selling these mobiles and refusing to return the product! AVOID BUYING THIS MOBILE PHONE if you can afford to spend Rs.1000 to Rs.2000 more.

Edit: After using the mobile for sometime now I feel that it is okay for light daily use like YouTube, WhatsApp, Facebook and general surfing, provided you have a strong WiFi signal. Keeping in view the affordable price of this phone, the 4GB RAM and 128GB ROM size is more than what we can desire. I have been using it for Facebook live sessions without much problems.; camera quality best, wide display , fast charging, battery backup good, touch is working smoothly, light weight, connectivity also good; Memory 256 is very good, charging to battery taking more than 3hrs.

I already owned a realme 3 phone and its working great, i sold it on cashify last week and it lasted with me since last 5 years.

The Realme Narzo 60X with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage is a true powerhouse in the mid-range smartphone market. With its impressive specifications and 5G support, it's a device that doesn't compromise on performance or connectivity.

**Performance:** Equipped with 8GB of RAM, this device handles multitasking with ease, ensuring smooth performance even when running multiple apps simultaneously. Whether you're gaming, streaming, or browsing the web, the Realme Narzo 60X delivers a lag-free experience.

**Storage:** With a generous 256GB of internal storage, you'll never have to worry about running out of space for your photos, videos, apps, and games. Plus, the option to expand storage further provides added flexibility for those with large media libraries.

**5G Connectivity:** Future-proofed with 5G support, the Realme Narzo 60X ensures that you'll be able to take advantage of blazing-fast internet speeds as 5G networks continue to roll out globally.

Overall, the Realme Narzo 60X with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage is a fantastic choice for users who demand high performance, ample storage, and future-proof connectivity. With its impressive specifications and affordable price point, it's a device that delivers exceptional value for money.; I recently purchased the Realme Narzo 60, and I must say, it's an outstanding budget phone that ticks all the right boxes. The camera performance, battery life, and overall daily task performance are top-notch. However, it's essential to mention that NFC is not provided, and there's some bloatware included.

Pros:
- Camera: The camera quality on the Realme Narzo 60 is surprisingly good for a phone in this price range. It captures sharp and vivid images with excellent color reproduction, making it a delight for photography enthusiasts.
- Battery Life: The battery life is impressive, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy usage. You can rely on it for extended periods without constantly worrying about charging.
-Charging speed:Quick charging is lightning fast! It reaches 70% in just 30 minutes.
- Performance: The Realme Narzo 60 handles daily tasks with ease. Whether it's multitasking or running demanding apps, the phone's performance remains smooth and lag-free.

Cons:
- No NFC: Unfortunately, the absence of NFC might be a drawback for users (Like Me) who rely on this technology for contactless payments and other NFC-related features.
- Bloatware: The phone comes with some pre-installed bloatware, which can be a bit bothersome. While most of it can be disabled, it would have been better to have a cleaner software experience.

Overall, if you're looking for a feature-packed phone with a fantastic camera, long-lasting battery, and excellent daily performance, the Realme Narzo 60 is a perfect choice. Just keep in mind the lack of NFC and the presence of bloatware. But considering its affordable price and other impressive features, these drawbacks are easy to overlook. Highly recommended for anyone on a budget!; Phone offer is good ,and phone me koe Kami nahi thi , good service.; Video camera is little less stable but overall phone is preety good
And gyro is little delayed so if you play pubg on gyro don't buy,
I don't know if gyro is bad in all Or only mine only.; I have purchased this on 20th August 2023. I am going to give this review as a person who has no deep knowledge. I just gonna write what I have noticed for now.
1. I found the performance to be really good. The phone's interface is smooth and works very quickly. There's no lag in switching from one app to another or in anything.
2. I like the camera. The quality is quite good and it has a lot of features. I can't say more as I am not a photo person.
3. The sound quality is good as well. The sound is loud and clear when played on speakers.
4. It's a very beautiful phone. I love the way it looks. It actually looks better than the picture. The edges are a little sharp but the phone still feels good in hands.
5. The picture quality is really good. The images are very sharp and bright. I love it. Because of this, playing games on this phone is a visual treat.
6. The fingerprint sensor is also good, which is probably because there's no separate sensor. It comes on screen as shown in the attached picture. I prefer it over the separate sensor.
7. The battery is quite bad. It discharges rather quickly if u play games or even watch YouTube. In my previous phone (Samsung M32), a whole day of complete usage (including music, gaming, browsing, YouTube and ott platforms, it still went down to only 25%). However, it charges very quickly too. I have seen it charging up to 20-25% in 10-15 min.
For now, I don't have any complaints except for the battery part."

It should come with at least 33-watt charging to keep up with the competition.
Also, while the display is okay with HD quality, it's disappointing that it's not full HD. A clearer and sharper display would make a big difference.
Overall, this has potential, but faster charging and better display quality are needed to make it worth the price."

From its design to its performance, this smartphone has a lot to offer.

Firstly, the design of the Tecno Pova 5 Pro is sleek and modern. It has a large 6.8-inch display with thin bezels, which provides an immersive viewing experience. The phone has a sturdy build and feels comfortable to hold. The fingerprint sensor on the back is quick and reliable, allowing for hassle-free unlocking of the device.

In terms of performance, the Tecno Pova 5 Pro performs excellently. It is powered by a MediaTek Helio G80 processor coupled with 6GB of RAM, which ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance. Whether I was browsing the internet, playing graphics-intensive games, or watching videos, the phone handled everything effortlessly. The 128GB internal storage is ample for storing my files, apps, and media.

The battery life of the Tecno Pova 5 Pro is truly impressive. With its massive 6,000mAh battery, I was able to use the phone extensively throughout the day without worrying about running out of power. Even on days of heavy usage, the battery easily lasted a full day, which is a huge plus for me.

The camera performance of the Tecno Pova 5 Pro is also commendable. It features a quad-camera setup, including a 48MP primary sensor, a 2MP macro lens, a 2MP depth sensor, and an AI lens. The photos captured were sharp, rich in detail, and had accurate colors. The 8MP front camera captured decent selfies with good skin tones.

The software experience of the Tecno Pova 5 Pro is smooth and user-friendly. It runs on HiOS 7.0 based on Android 10, providing a clean interface and a plethora of customization options. The phone also comes pre-loaded with useful apps and features that enhance the overall experience.

Overall, the Tecno Pova 5 Pro is a fantastic smartphone with a lot to offer. With its impressive performance, long-lasting battery, and capable camera system, it is a great choice for anyone looking for a mid-range smartphone. I highly recommend it for its value for money proposition, and it certainly exceeded my expectations.; All over performance is good, Selfie camera could be better, photos from 50mp are satisfactory.
Sometime backlight is not working.
Charging is fast, no lag time, touch is good
Sound quality could be better from both sounds, Display is good
Rest is okay ......
Backlight isn't working; Hey all,

It's been almost 6months I'm using this phone: Tecno Pova Pro 5g. And I got to say that Tecno has done a really great job in providing such a masterpiece.

Pros:
1. Gets more attention than iPhone users for starters.
2. Performance and features like backlight, my video show, bluetooth/signal connectivity are top notch.
3. Camera quality is good, and features like super night and video editing are amazing.
4. Dual speakers for optimal sound output.
5. Never lags on anything even for multiscreen uses.
6. Face unlock and fingerprint/security is A grade.

Cons:
AI Camera whitewashes images, so a darker person may appear with a lighter skin tone.

Overall my recommendation is GO for it. It is the best Phone in this price range and also beats many more brands' phones which are expensive for the sake of clout and gives them a run for their incapablities.

Thank you Tecno.; I got the device on republic day sale at 13k..although I was a moto user I prefer stock android anyday..but I must say tecno did a good job on its ui..I am using this phone for 15 days and pros are: good performance...very good display..decent back camera..very smooth and lag free gaming experience..nice rgb backlight
Cons are: below avg front cam...battery backup may be improved
Overall a very nice 5g device in 13k range..very good for day to day usage..satisfactory gaming experience..but not for camera enthusiasts..
Hope this will help; 1. So I purchased this product as a gaming phone but it's giving 40fps rating also in bgmi it's graphics are smooth + high available only.
2. Camera quality is good but not that much.
3. I loved the sound quality 😍
4. Best design and build of body looks cool as a gaming phone.
5. Charging was good for first 7 days now not getting charged as given watt is 68 but charges at the speed of 25w
6. Display quality and colours are pretty cool
7. Back side glymph light is very very cool.

Final results - purchase it as a budget phone for daily use not as a gaming phone ☺️; I recommend this phone; Dunque, dunque. Ho aspettato di usarlo per due giorni prima di scrivere questa recensione. Per chi non vuol leggere troppo sintetizzo: davvero un ottimo prodotto di fascia media.
Partiamo punto per punto.
Design: 9 davvero bella la scocca posteriore con motivi in rilievo e la retroilluminazione a led RGB utile anche per notifiche. Effetto wow garantito. Il fronte è piuttosto simile a tanti altri, ma ha comunque bordo tra fine schermo e scocca piuttosto limitato tranne che per la parte in basso più spessa.
Materiali: 8 il telefono è ben assemblato e realizzato. Tuttavia tranne per il vetro frontale è composto di plastica. Sia il retro che la scocca laterale. Quindi è consigliabile usare sempre una cover a protezione.
Hardware: 8,5 il telefono è fluido, lo schermo ha una ottima definizione seppur non essendo amoled, bensì LCD IPS, si comporta bene. I neri sono quelli comunque di un pannello LCD, quindi non esattamente neri. Comunque per certo versi io lo preferisco per la resa dei colori e delle sfumature. Troppo contrasto mi dà noia e poi è 120 hertz di refresh. Non affatica gli occhi. Tanta RAM tanta Rom che si può espandere, dual SIM, 5g, doppio speaker, presa cuffie, Bluetooth 5.1, GPS, NFC, ricarica rapida. Non manca quasi nulla.
Fotocamere: 7,5 forse la parte meno interessante. Tuttavia funzionano più che dignitosamente. Anche in notturna si possono ottenere scatti utilizzabili. Sconsiglio l'uso di AI. Video accettabili... si sente la mancanza dello stabilizzatore.
Audio: 9 potente e di qualità sia dal doppio speaker che dalla presa cuffie. Anche in Bluetooth tutto ok
Batteria: 8 si carica velocissimamente grazie all'alimentatore da 68w e in versione SIM singola il telefono regge molto molto bene la giornata. Con il dual SIM acceso arriverete comunque a sera con un 10/15% di autonomia residua.
Segnale telefonico: 8,5 prende bene. Nessun problema con wifi, Bluetooth e GPS. Purtroppo arrivo fino a 4g+ non avendo una SIM 5g
Processore, Rom, RAM: 9 mai un impuntamento, tutto scorre fluido.
Voto finale 8,5
Cosa sarebbe la ciliegina sulla 🍰:
Ricarica wireless, scocca laterale in metallo e dietro in vetro. Non inserisco schermo amoled, perché non reputo sarebbe di qualità su questa fascia di prezzo.
Lo consiglio: assolutamente si! Arrivo da un notissimo marchio... Avevo bisogno di un telefono con schermo più grosso per motivi di vista, senza farmi dissanguare.
Povo 5 pro 5g è un apparecchio che non mi fa rimpiangere troppo il telefono precedente.
Brava Tecno.; El móvil me vino perfecto todo pero el efecto de retroalimentación que son las luces de atrás del móvil no brillan y lo tengo bien configurado; Ce téléphone a deux update de sortie en novembre et décembre 2023, je ne les reçois pas et le service client Tecno me renvoie a une adresse mail qui ne répond pas. Très déçu de ce produit pour le moment.; Great item and good service."

Drainage of battery very fast
And very slow charging; The packing and quality of the item is very beautiful. The products are very good. Thank you amazon; Overall ok but i expect little more better than this...dloby atmos is not much commendable thing...also camera is not impresiive...charger & battery is better. Worth for buying on this price range. If ypu are looking for little bit more better performance go for an upgraded segment.; After moderate use battery stays 2 days in single charge, camera is decent, volume is low on calls, good overall.; Hardware wise this phone is the best at this price range, but the overall phone is brought down by the software experience.

I had purchased this budget phone, as a backup phone with all apps for work, and to keep connected to all this via my Samsung Galaxy Watch.

The phone keeps disconnecting from my galaxy watch, because the phone force closes the Galaxy Wear app.

After a lot of research on why my Galaxy watch kept disconnecting from my phone, I found out that older phones that are updated to the latest Android software and new Budget phones simply kill apps in the background.

I've tried all the tips and tricks to keep the apps running, but nothing works.

Besides this, even will all apps closed the phone is very laggy, and heats up with minimal usage (even after watching anything on YouTube for 15mins)."

1. Superb design
2. Good Ram and ROM
3. Good camera if not Superb
4. Good screen if not best
5. No bloatware and stock android
6. And finally, Good battery with day day performance as my wife don't play game.

I am truly happy to share that this phone has exceeded my expectations in every corner. Actually, I was little skeptical about the screen as it is only HD plus, however to my surprise, it is best HD plus display I have every seen. Not much difference. Camera also exceeded my expectations, though little improvement is required in white exposure. And surprisingly, it is from indian brand Lava. Long live Lava!! Keep doing great. I am owing samsung but I swear If Lava keeps doing this, my next phone will be from Lava. Everyone in my family and friends praised this. My true words.

Few things which was a true surprise as I didn't expect at all in this price segment:-

1. Haptics (best means best, even better than premium segment phones)

2. Screen color reproduction is sometimes equal to that of Amoled, though not always. But believe me HD plus display will not be a regret.

3. awesome Ram management and UFC 2.1 will definitely make your feel of using a premium phones

4. Looks - not even 25 to 30k phone will come near to this.

Though, some cons are also there-

1. Slow charger - takes around 3 hours to charge battery, though battery backup is Superb.

2. Video lags in 2k 60 FPS, though work fine in 1080 60 fps. This really requires efforts from Lava as it is possible to improve via update.

3. Camera white exposure and portrait mode requires improvements.

4. Background stream - in review videos, option of background stream like YouTube is shown, however in reality, I am unable to see this. Please get this done with an update.

5. Last but not least - place of fingerprint sensor or power key sometimes feel uncomfortable for new user. Though, not an issue after some days use.

If the above issues are possible to resolve, please resolve Lava.

No phone can come close to this pure stock android experience in this price range.

However, the way you have made a come back in indian market is Superb. All the best my indian company. Keep doing great.; For the price, it's good comparatively to other phones but sometimes behave abnormally. When you are on a phone call, the mute button gets activated accidentally (as many other customers complaint that their mic stops working during a phone call, mute is the real reason and therefore its location should be changed).
Camera is good but not that great. Display is average but 5G speed is awesome even when it's not 5G+, can easily compete or even beat my 5G+ moto g54.

Battery backup is also good. Charger heats sometimes.

Overall, Value for money!!!; Very good product. As of know i have experienced good voice quality in call, and internet speed is also no problem. screen is also very good , smooth working.
Product shipped with appropriate back cover which is quite good, it saved my time for searching.
overall as of know it is very good phone for the price.; After using it for sometimes i think it's a good configured smartphone.
Camera is good if you're are coming from low end hardware to this phone it's worth it. although low light photo will be little hazy but it tolerable if you really want to take good picture use pro mode customize your own setting.
Battery life after heavy usage on 2gb per day data it's gives more than 8 hours runtime.
All application run smoothly except some custom app like redmi weather app(didn't work). network is really good in it everything run smoothly but i don't like the launcher it's nice light weight but it's missing options like not allowing play store from creating desktop/homescreen icon, miss those little light indicator on old smartphone, missing option to change font(pure hatred for default google font) .
display is nice but dont like jelly feeling when i am scrolling.
charger is normal charger ,best it don't heat up like other company (redmi) charger. The charger cable is little lose from usb-A side but not bad.; Affordable and good quality phone, photo quality is also good, smooth working; Looks Premium, value for money. Camera is not that good but it is extremely good at Gaming and processing Multiple Apps at once. Go for it over redmi or Tecno; Camera is superb only rest of things of not good. Like they provide 8 GB Ram but battery level drain in few time 30 minutes 8 percent drain. No fast charge."

Here are the highlights:

Curved 1.5K Display: The curved 1.5K display is stunning. Colors are vibrant, and the viewing experience is immersive. Watching videos and playing games on this screen is a real treat.

Battery Backup: The battery backup is fantastic. I can easily get through a full day of heavy use without worrying about running out of juice.Performance: Performance-wise, the GT 6T is a beast. Apps open quickly, multitasking is smooth, and I haven't experienced any lag or stutter, even with demanding games.

Charging Speed: This is where the phone falls a bit short. The company claims it charges from 0 to 50% in 10 minutes, but in my experience, it takes about 20 minutes. While it's not a dealbreaker, it does fall short of expectations.

Camera: The camera is good. Photos are clear and detailed, and the camera app offers a lot of features and modes to play with. It's perfect for capturing those special moments.

System UI Optimization: The system UI is well-optimized. It's user-friendly, responsive, and packed with useful features without being overwhelming.

Overall, the GT 6T is a great phone with a few minor drawbacks. If the charging speed was as fast as advertised, it would be nearly perfect. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a powerful and visually stunning smartphone.; The Realme GT 6T stands out as a formidable competitor in the mid-range smartphone market, offering an impressive blend of performance, design, and value. Here’s a comprehensive look at why this phone deserves your attention:

Design and Build Quality
The Realme GT 6T features a sleek and modern design with premium materials that give it a high-end feel. The device is slim, lightweight, and ergonomically designed, making it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods. The vibrant color options and glossy finish add a touch of sophistication.

Display
The 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display is one of the highlights of the Realme GT 6T. With a resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels, it delivers sharp, vivid, and colorful visuals. The 120Hz refresh rate ensures smooth scrolling and an excellent gaming experience. The display also supports HDR10+, making it ideal for watching high-definition content.

Performance
Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, the Realme GT 6T offers top-notch performance. Whether you are multitasking, gaming, or running demanding applications, the device handles everything with ease. Coupled with up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, it ensures a lag-free and responsive experience.

Camera
The camera setup on the Realme GT 6T is impressive. The 64MP main sensor captures stunning photos with excellent detail and vibrant colors. The 16MP ultra-wide-angle lens is perfect for landscape shots, and the 8MP macro lens allows for detailed close-ups. The 32MP front camera delivers clear and attractive selfies, enhanced by various AI beautification features.

Battery Life
With a 5000mAh battery, the Realme GT 6T offers exceptional battery life. It easily lasts a full day on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The 65W SuperDart fast charging technology is a game-changer, allowing the phone to charge from 0% to 100% in just under an hour.

Software
The Realme GT 6T runs on Realme UI 4.0, based on Android 13. The user interface is clean, intuitive, and packed with useful features. Realme has done a great job in minimizing bloatware, and the overall software experience is smooth and responsive.

Additional Features
5G Connectivity: Future-proof your device with 5G capabilities for faster download and streaming speeds.
In-Display Fingerprint Sensor: Quick and secure unlocking.
Stereo Speakers: Excellent sound quality for media consumption.
Conclusion
The Realme GT 6T is a stellar smartphone that offers a flagship experience at a mid-range price. Its combination of a stunning display, powerful performance, versatile camera system, and long-lasting battery makes it a great choice for anyone looking to upgrade their mobile device. Realme has once again delivered a device that punches well above its weight, making the GT 6T a highly recommended option.; I am quite impressed with this phone overall. The screen is fabulous and the processor is decent for the price point. You can significantly reduce bloatware by disabling unnecessary apps and services, which makes the phone feel very smooth during everyday use.I played Call of Duty: Warzone on it, and the game performs well for the most part. The phone charges super fast, and the battery backup is good, though not quite as exceptional as advertised. The screen brightness is sufficient even in direct sunlight, which is a big plus.However, I do have one complaint. The LTPO panel, which is supposed to lower the refresh rate to 1Hz when the screen is displaying static content, doesn't seem to work properly in my case. Despite trying it at full brightness, the refresh rate stays at 60Hz.; Been using GT Master Edition since I got it back in the day with it's OS updates coming to a standstill I was looking for a new device and long behold Realme brought this thing at the right time.
Being a performance focused phone there is no lag and the device is obviously super fast and responsive, battery life is easily an A+ with the 5500 mah battery paired with the LTPO display. The cameras felt a bit lacking but that's pretty common in this price point as well as for these performance oriented phones, still the shooters are pretty decent and photos come out quite nice.
The sound can feel a bit lacking at times but at others the stereo speakers definitely come through, maybe an issue with the media.
The phone is quite hefty and on the wider side being a bit hard to use single handedly. While there are only 9 supported bands for 5g personally didn't face any issues with connectivity for Jio and Airtel 5g which I use.; As a realme GT series fan ( my last mobile was GT Neo 2 ) this is tenfold upgrade for me in terms of form factor & durability.
First when holding this you can't feel heaviness, weight distribution is done properly. Screen is top notch, when compared it with a mi Amoled screen this panel seems like IMAX quality screen. And sound quality wise dual stereo speakers gave perfect enjoyable output.
Software is fluid, no lag is faced in doing heavy work. Build quality is where realme outshined it's predecessors and competitors, nice build quality.
Overall it's one of the best Price to performance device from realme."

Let's start with the positive aspects. The battery life is good and the fast charger is handy for quick top-ups. The camera quality is noteworthy, delivering clear and high-quality photos. The slow-motion video recorder adds a creative touch to capturing memorable moments. The expandable memory options, with a massive 256GB of internal storage and the possibility of expanding up to 2TB, are certainly standout features that set this phone apart.

However, I have found the sound quality to be lacking, which is disappointing considering the overall excellence of the device.

On a positive note, the phone's processor performs well, and with the right settings, the device can run smoothly. The fingerprint sensor on the side adds a convenient security feature, and the phone is described as lightweight with an aesthetically pleasing design.

In conclusion, the Realme 11 5G offers an attractive set of features at a reasonable price. However, I would rate it 3 out of 5, mainly because of the issues with audio and camera quality. Prospective buyers should carefully consider their priorities and preferences before making a purchase, and it might be worthwhile to check for any updates or improvements addressing the reported issues."

Realme Narzo 7G Pro 5G: कम बजट में दमदार प्रदर्शन

Camera performance is good enough capture nice details; I have been using this phone past couple of days and here are my personal experience with the device.
Performance 4/5.
Although this is not the best performing phone is this price point but still i have not felt that because its really good and can run bgmi at smooth+extreme(that is the only game i played on this).
Software 5/5.
realme ui is known for bundling so many bloatware and ads but this phone had none of it, no hot apps and hot games and you can just disable apps like app market, game center etc. This probably might be the most smoothest smartphone is this price range, the animations and all are soo good. Haven't seen a single bug yet.
Battery 4/5.
Its pretty good, i got 6.5-7.5 hrs sot on really heavy usage like 4.5 hours gaming and on 5g network.
Camera 3/5.
I was kind of Disappointed with the camera despite having such a capable sensor(imx 890 same as one plus 11 Series). The colors are so saturated and unnatural. There is also a lot of oversharpening in the image and just ruins the details. The low light performance it pretty good and video quality is also pretty good but you dont get stabilization in 4k. I did download gcam which made things 100 times better than before.
Extras.
The speakers are really good
haptics are just okay
amazing network reception and wifi performance
Amazing software features.

Overall its a pretty good phone and I DO NOT REGRET making this purchase.; Writing after one week use. It's a good choice in this price range. Camera quality also good.."

What I love in this phone:

Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 processor never lets you down while performing heavy tasks.

Along with processor it also comes with dedicated Gaming Boost Engine that makes your gaming experience even smoother and longer without heating.

Double stereo speaker gives an awesome sound quality.

5500mah battery can easily last upto 2 days even after heavy usage. On moderate or average usage it gives you 3-4 days backup. And most important, 100 watt supervooc charger will charge it within 25 minutes, its a big adapter and weighs just like a brick.

50MP+8MP main camera setup is a functional camera setup and a 16MP selfie camera, its not gonna disappoint you but don't compare with those camera centric smartphones, this phone is heavily on performance side but still it is giving you a good camera.

Display is superb, amoled display that gives you high definition media quality.. bazzles are almost non existing and gives you a premium experience like flagship displays.

Comes with O-Haptics feedback and completely like Iphones..really loving it...

8GB RAM+8GB virtual RAM with 256GB UFS 3.1 ROM makes it superb and most importantly there are many of phones that gives you 12GB of RAM in this price range but don't look at the numbers, the biggest factor is brand and performance. Point to be noted, Its 8GB RAM is better than Realme, poco vivo or oppo 12GB RAM....

After starting the phone, you will start getting updates within a week, and will get many of new features even not described in specifications,, its a surprise for you...they are gonna give you even more features in updates that will make it a flagship killer..

Oneplus is just similar to Samsung or Apple, is better known for making premium and flagship devices, so I will not compare these brands with any other brands,,they are reliable and doing a great job in smartphone market, you can chose any one of these three brands..; Reviewing after 20days of usage.
Good performece won't say this phone is best but okay for normal usage not for gaming or super heavy user purpose. Display is decent thumbs up for it.
Camera is mediocre, battery run for whole day, good thing is it super charged with 100W charger from 20-100% in 30minute
phone is not heating as other are saying, althought it's normal for smartphone to get heated while charging so it happens with this one.
played Pubg fro 4-7hours non stop at HD settings it worked smoothly. Their is high performance mode and 120hz settings so not to worry we can turn it on for heavy usage like gaming but it will consume more battery.
Screen is is visible bright in outdoors against sunlight..
Phone will take around 20gb of storage for system.
my current occupied storage is 44gb with apps out of 128gb.
Phone UI is good not best, good thing is their is no bloaware their are some apps which we can disable easily.
with 20days of calling, gaming, heavy video watching i m satisfied with the product..no issue for now.
Even I dropped mistakenly this one it's fine with the cover nothing bad happened.
I m 1st time one plus user very happy, I also bought 1year extended warranty from official one plus website...so I have 2yrs manufacture warranty at extra Rs.599.
phone body is plastic nd fits good in big hands, small hand people will face problem holding the device.
Final suggestion yes go for it if you are normal usage watching videos, running different apps for various task, calling also decent but speaker is not too loud on call but that's acceptable.Price could have been lower around 18k or 20k something.
Bought at 24.5k.. of which 22k is price and 2.5k GST.; I usually not write ✍️ review very fast when it comes to smartphone. First I need to use it and under rigorous testing only I can put forward my verdict so that any brother or sister can buy the same from Amazon.
BODY : OnePlus has comeup with a very durable body and stylish. Looking premium.

DISPLAY: Its a PureAmoled with 10Bit resolution with crispy HDR10 features. Vibrant natural color and screen ratio is 88.5% to body ratio. So very less bezels.

BATTERY: Easily comes for 1 and half day if not playing any games. With games 1 day. No idle midnight auto battery drain and all. 5500mAh is very slowly discharging and due to 100w charger coming inside the box the mobile charges in 17 to 18minutes only upto 85% and full 100% charging approx 19 minutes as per my test.

CAMERA: Very ok for the price. I got one update recently in May 25, 2024 and after this the camera works wonderful specially selfie and portrait mode.

PROCESSOR: Snapdragon 7Gen3 name is enough that it is very stable and fast multi tasking and even this snapdragon version not heats up fastly. The clock speed is amazingly impressive to any games like PUBG or FreeFires or Asphalt. Rest all the medium games runs smoothly. No throttle. No lag and even No uncommon heating issues etc.

METWORK: Very fast 5G and even 4G also no issues. Runs smoothly without any call drop or any disturbance in voice quality. The Voice Focus mode works very nice even in the rush or crowded metro area. Last time recorded download speed was 175mbps & upload speed approx 145 to 166mbps.

STEREO SPEAKERS: This is what attracted me the most. The stereo speakers are very loud enough. And even it sync the eaarpods very quickly. OnePlus earpods are recommended for all those EQ and bass.

OVERALL VERDICT: Very lightest mobile inspite of 5500 mAh battery. Too premium boxy design. Call and network speed very impressive. After investing on this phone I have not regretted. Highly recommended and Value for money. Thanks Seller and Amazon. 100w charger in the box. Backcase and screen guard all in the box. A complete midrange killer phone. Highly valuable."

For those interested to still want it on the device, the apk has to be installed additionally. For me, I like that wonderful feature as it was a life saver in older Poco/ Redmi/ Mi phones when the Menu/ Home/ Back navigation panel failed. With Quickball, my Redmi 3s is still working perfectly since last 7.5+ years. So, I did load the quickball version 15.0.1.0.1 and being tested.

POCO phones are always the beta for 'go to market' followed by the equivalent redmi versions. I have been using POCO (F1, C3, M3) user for many years, are truely worth the money, good hardware.
Many came with a 6000mAh battery but this one has 5000mAh battery (Hence ****). The charger is fast (22.5W) but I prefer to slow charge the battery at night with a 5V/ 0.7A or 1A charger to improve the battery life, reduce the risk of battery bulging. Due to no heat-up (Li-ion does not like heat, hence slow charging is safest), battery remains safe and long lasting. The box came with its own transparent back-cover but I prefer a thicker back cover.
Has a single Loudspeaker, hence lower audio volume (Hence ****). The protective film also had a small bubble (Hence ****). But the Screen is bright, even 30% is good for normal use.
The most important feature of Xiaomi is the backup and restore, making the new phone have the exact look of your old Xiaomi phone in less than 5 minutes, some apps may not get backed-up.
Finally, Amazon delivery was on time. Its just 4 days of testing and as of know I am satisfied.

Update after a week of use- Though the download speed is good, the phone does not show 5G (JIO SIM) on its display (it shows 4G+). This is an important part to resolve, probably a patch may be necessary if at all this is a bug, since the service provider detects it as a 5G phone but the phone itself shows 4G+. Requesting Xiaomi to validate my finding and close this accordingly.
When the same SIM is put in another phone (Samsung/ IPhone), it shows 5G clearly. So this is an issue to be resolved by XIAOMI to prove that it is genuinely a 5G phone.
No heating issue noticed after a week of use now.

UPDATE 2:
We can force the network setting to 5G through developer options as 'NR' in Set preferred network type. But the battery drains drastically, hence avoid that. So the phone is obviously 5G when network setting is forced. Obviously all may not want to touch developer mode, so best to leave it as 5G/LTE in normal network settings. If XIAOMI patches to augment the setting as NR only in addition to common settings, it can show up 5G on the display, but at the cost of high battery consumption.

UPDATE 3 (16 April 2024):
The legendary Xiaomi Quickball (apk version 15.0.1.0.1) has been tested and found to be working satisfactorily. Post hardening of HyperOS, the phone is almost AD free. Google loaded its own 'Messages' apk which will take control of the inbuilt default 'Messaging' app I have kept the Messaging app as default for messages as I dont want to use messages app of google for privacy control. Battery being 5000mAH, is found to be lasting for 2 days with mobile data 'ON'. A 6000mAH battery would have been better as found on many earlier POCO phones. Quality of hardware is very good and performing. With the new HyperOS 1.0.2.0 loaded, 2 years of formal updates makes it a an economical phone with good features. Reminding all that ads-free performance can only be achieved after hardening through developer mode. I havent used memory boost function, I dont think I will require it with a 8GB (uses LPDDR5) memory. Only if needed, I will configure it. I have also installed a 128 GB memory card, which virtually reduces internal memory usage.

UPDATE 4 (18 April 2024):
A bug is identified on HyperOS. When Wifi calling is ON and Wifi is connected with a stable network, outgoing calls cannot be made. Incoming calls also do not get through. I have tested this multiple times. Xiaomi has to immediately act and fix this bug. Upon putting WiFi calling OFF, the phone resumes normally. This problem did not exist on earlier MIUI used by me.

Except this new bug identified and therefore stopping Wifi calling (actually stopping wifi calling has improved the battery life, so I dont mind not having this feature as JIO network does not have issues in our area and around), POCO M6 Pro 5G is a decent value for money. Most positives, smaller negatives for a phone in 11-12k range. Surely, Xiaomi should action it with a patch immediately.

UPDATE 5.. Only for MIUI phone users, wont work for other phones (18 May 2024):
When POCO M6 Pro is fully configured, take its backup using Additional Settings--> Backup and restore. A backup file is generated in MIUI folder under AllBackup--> Backups--> Filename with backup date. Simply copy that file and move it to your old Mi/ Redmi/ POCO phone (min. Android 10) in exacly the same folder. Then restore that file. While it will replicate the phone, you will get the benefit of the new look Control Centre. The old MIUI Control Centre will be replaced by the new HyperOS Control Centre with no change to Android Version or security patch. I liked this look and have retained the new HyperOS Control Center in my old POCO C3, which is a backup of the new phone (in case of exercising Disaster Recovery option). Its like the old Car in a new shell. Havent had any issue on that since last 15 days of using the HyperOS Control Centre in the old POCO C3. Others can enjoy too.

5 g - future ready
Good hardware configuration
Good battery
Good build
Good looks
Regular os updates

Cons :
Average rear camera
Bad front camera
Very slow charging

18 w slow charger for 5000 mah phone battery.

Overall verdict
Performance & budget friendly 5g quality smartphone that can last 5 years is this phone.

Camera lovers , fast charging & wireless charging feature lovers should definitely stay away.

Best buy in this price segment. Future ready & durable. Very good build quality & touch screen display is very good at this price point .

Instead of wasting 7 to 8 k on average phone brands with bad configuration.better to go for a good one like poco by redmi.; Used 6 months. It is Good at this price point. Go for 8/256. Its an average phone for basic uses and storage.

* Slow charging and Battery doesn't last for a day.
* Decent Camera, definitely not for vloging or high-quality photography. good for memory capturing or important record/doc capturing...
* Good Screen resolution.
* NO heating so far.
* great processor, No lagging till date.; I bought this phone for my mom. I will try to keep this review short for potential buyers.

Pros
1. Display is decent. Not HD but decent.
2. Camera is nice. Even the night vision pics are fairly clear.
3. 5G connection is smooth.
4. Battery performance is quite good.

Cons
1. Lags a bit on heavy usage.
2. Feels slightly heavy as a device.
3. Back glass cover is a finger magnet. And you have to be careful with it, cause I see potential for cracks.
4. Doesn't offer higher resolution for videos on Yotube.

I purchased it under an offer, & received extra discount. At under 10k price it is a decent device to have.; Processor
is good at this price range, BGMI performance is decent with medium setting.

Display
is bigger but I'm disappointed with its brightness. Company claims 1300 nits but I don't think it is more than 800 nits.

Battery
Is very average, 30 mins of gaming and nearly 15% battery drops. The company claims it to be 5000 mah, but I'm sure it is not more than 4000 mah. It drops very quickly.

Charging
is pretty good and faster. 30 mins of charging gives 30% battery life. But due to very low battery quality, you might need to charge it twice a day.

The phone is lighter than majority of phones, and look wise it is more attractive.

Camera
Is the best part I liked the most. Any other phones don't have such camera quality at this price segment.

Ram Rom performance is v.good and storage of 128gb is enough. With 6 gb Ram. This phone is ditto copy of Redmi 12, but that is at ₹12500, only difference is the branding. I suggest you to buy this one Poco m6 pro, which is way cheaper.

Sound Quality is decent at this price.
Rest all the features performs really well and I bought this at a discount @ ₹9999.
I'm happy with this product for the price I paid.

If you can afford ₹3000 than this range, then definitely go for some other options, because poco has boasted this product a lot. It is 20% less than what is claims.; I am using this phone from past 15 days. Its a good device according to its price. Only issue is its battery. Battery backup is not good and even the charging time is long. Othervise performance is good, build of the phone is also good. Overall a good phone at this price range; Pros; big and handfriendly display,beautifully built,affordable,android14.cons ; feeble and hardly audible sound from cheap bottom firing single speaker,very bad rear cameras,selfie camera is OK,I will not recommend to buy,battery is draining fast eventhough chip is 4nm"

What I love in this phone:

Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 processor never lets you down while performing heavy tasks.

Along with processor it also comes with dedicated Gaming Boost Engine that makes your gaming experience even smoother and longer without heating.

Double stereo speaker gives an awesome sound quality.

5500mah battery can easily last upto 2 days even after heavy usage. On moderate or average usage it gives you 3-4 days backup. And most important, 100 watt supervooc charger will charge it within 25 minutes, its a big adapter and weighs just like a brick.

50MP+8MP main camera setup is a functional camera setup and a 16MP selfie camera, its not gonna disappoint you but don't compare with those camera centric smartphones, this phone is heavily on performance side but still it is giving you a good camera.

Display is superb, amoled display that gives you high definition media quality.. bazzles are almost non existing and gives you a premium experience like flagship displays.

Comes with O-Haptics feedback and completely like Iphones..really loving it...

8GB RAM+8GB virtual RAM with 256GB UFS 3.1 ROM makes it superb and most importantly there are many of phones that gives you 12GB of RAM in this price range but don't look at the numbers, the biggest factor is brand and performance. Point to be noted, Its 8GB RAM is better than Realme, poco vivo or oppo 12GB RAM....

After starting the phone, you will start getting updates within a week, and will get many of new features even not described in specifications,, its a surprise for you...they are gonna give you even more features in updates that will make it a flagship killer..

Oneplus is just similar to Samsung or Apple, is better known for making premium and flagship devices, so I will not compare these brands with any other brands,,they are reliable and doing a great job in smartphone market, you can chose any one of these three brands..; Reviewing after 20days of usage.
Good performece won't say this phone is best but okay for normal usage not for gaming or super heavy user purpose. Display is decent thumbs up for it.
Camera is mediocre, battery run for whole day, good thing is it super charged with 100W charger from 20-100% in 30minute
phone is not heating as other are saying, althought it's normal for smartphone to get heated while charging so it happens with this one.
played Pubg fro 4-7hours non stop at HD settings it worked smoothly. Their is high performance mode and 120hz settings so not to worry we can turn it on for heavy usage like gaming but it will consume more battery.
Screen is is visible bright in outdoors against sunlight..
Phone will take around 20gb of storage for system.
my current occupied storage is 44gb with apps out of 128gb.
Phone UI is good not best, good thing is their is no bloaware their are some apps which we can disable easily.
with 20days of calling, gaming, heavy video watching i m satisfied with the product..no issue for now.
Even I dropped mistakenly this one it's fine with the cover nothing bad happened.
I m 1st time one plus user very happy, I also bought 1year extended warranty from official one plus website...so I have 2yrs manufacture warranty at extra Rs.599.
phone body is plastic nd fits good in big hands, small hand people will face problem holding the device.
Final suggestion yes go for it if you are normal usage watching videos, running different apps for various task, calling also decent but speaker is not too loud on call but that's acceptable.Price could have been lower around 18k or 20k something.
Bought at 24.5k.. of which 22k is price and 2.5k GST.; I usually not write ✍️ review very fast when it comes to smartphone. First I need to use it and under rigorous testing only I can put forward my verdict so that any brother or sister can buy the same from Amazon.
BODY : OnePlus has comeup with a very durable body and stylish. Looking premium.

DISPLAY: Its a PureAmoled with 10Bit resolution with crispy HDR10 features. Vibrant natural color and screen ratio is 88.5% to body ratio. So very less bezels.

BATTERY: Easily comes for 1 and half day if not playing any games. With games 1 day. No idle midnight auto battery drain and all. 5500mAh is very slowly discharging and due to 100w charger coming inside the box the mobile charges in 17 to 18minutes only upto 85% and full 100% charging approx 19 minutes as per my test.

CAMERA: Very ok for the price. I got one update recently in May 25, 2024 and after this the camera works wonderful specially selfie and portrait mode.

PROCESSOR: Snapdragon 7Gen3 name is enough that it is very stable and fast multi tasking and even this snapdragon version not heats up fastly. The clock speed is amazingly impressive to any games like PUBG or FreeFires or Asphalt. Rest all the medium games runs smoothly. No throttle. No lag and even No uncommon heating issues etc.

METWORK: Very fast 5G and even 4G also no issues. Runs smoothly without any call drop or any disturbance in voice quality. The Voice Focus mode works very nice even in the rush or crowded metro area. Last time recorded download speed was 175mbps & upload speed approx 145 to 166mbps.

STEREO SPEAKERS: This is what attracted me the most. The stereo speakers are very loud enough. And even it sync the eaarpods very quickly. OnePlus earpods are recommended for all those EQ and bass.

OVERALL VERDICT: Very lightest mobile inspite of 5500 mAh battery. Too premium boxy design. Call and network speed very impressive. After investing on this phone I have not regretted. Highly recommended and Value for money. Thanks Seller and Amazon. 100w charger in the box. Backcase and screen guard all in the box. A complete midrange killer phone. Highly valuable."

A complete package which don't let you down in anything. Not the best but you can think of it a full package.
It's running awesome for me as per my use cases. Battery is awesome,
Charging is also awesome,
the processor is awesome too,
Display is super cool for hdr content.
Overall i liked this phone very much. Not like other brands so called environment savers .; Upgraded from 7 to 12r
Pros
1) awesome display
2) performance is good as usual . Handle all the apps well
3) good battery and fast charging. I don't find heating issue while do fast charging
4) call reception is good.
5) camer is okay
6) back cover comes with phone is good
7) os is okay
Cons
1) camera need improvement
2) os need improvement
3) screen size is bigger , movie or videos not coming in full screen without zoom

Best phone for display, day to day activities and good battery and durability.; High performance phone with decent photography. Battery backup is not good at all. Some time its screen on time is less than 7 hours with no gaming.
Fingerprint sensor is very fast . Sound quality is also very good. Screen is very smooth. Phone is very clean. Build quality is also good.; Great camera, no heating issues, great performance and best in class battery backup. Getting almost 8 hours of SOT.; ; I have purchased this phone on the first sale and it was my best decision.
In the real world usage this phone exceeds my expectations. I previously used Mi10i, Poco f1 and the main complaint i made was for the OS.
Pros-
1. Smooth performance because of Snapdragon 8gen 2
2. Clean OS
3. Best Display
4. Superb Build Quality
5. Beast Battery Backup
6. Super fast charging
7. Top gaming performance

Cons-
1. Decent Camera
2. Base variant only has 128 gb storage. Atleast 256gb should be provided by oneplus because we are paying 40k for this phone.

Guy's i know Oneplus had a controversy about UFS 4.0 but trust me this is an all-rounder phone. I am happy with my purchase and i was confused between Iqoo Neo 9 pro and Oneplus 12r. Glad i went with this phone because build quality really matters and Iqoo Neo 9 pro has the worst build quality. I dropped my phone often so prefer strong build quality. I didn't dropped this yet so kudos to me. 😂; One of best phone I have ever used. Back camera quality is amazing. Screen display very smooth. Battery life un beatable. Performance 5/5. Appearance eye killing. Over all I will rate 💯.; The OnePlus 12R brings a lot to the table, blending top-notch performance, an eye-catching design, and a stellar camera system. With its OxygenOS, navigating through the device feels smooth and intuitive, enhancing the overall user experience. While it excels in many areas, it falls a bit short on battery life, which could be a concern for heavy users. Additionally, the lack of UFs 3.1 storage might be a downside for those who need extra speed for their files and apps. Nonetheless, it remains a compelling option for anyone seeking a premium smartphone with a blend of style and substance."

Value for money; Received the phone today. Wrong selection of phone also the features mentioned are wrong.
Very slow charging. A 12k phone with so poor charging feature. 3% charge in 6 mins.
Camera is average; Camera quality is ok; Nice good value of money; Dont expect much its good for browsing watching videos and light gaming with decent camera; Writing review after using it for 4 months.

I bought it on the Last freedom sale for Rs. 41,999 ( including 6k instant discount coupon).
First let me be clear , I bought ' S20 FE 5G 'with Snapdragon 865 , not ' S20 FE with Exynos ' and i am a user who uses phone most of the time .
This review may be long but it's worth to read it if you're buying this product.
Let me divide between the Pros and Cons.
First i would like like to start with Pros of the Device ,
Pros :
1. Display :
Samsung has been already popular for it's AMOLED Displays but i saw some of the reviewers wrote about some display issues here . They might have got some defective Piece. I have no issues with my display . It's been long time i saw a great display like this ... with 120Hz it is Super Smooth.
Also , it is very bright on outdoors and can decrease it to very low while using at low light conditions ( PS : No tint issues )
The in display finger print scanner is very fast and didn't faced any issues with it .

2. Stereo Speakers :
As an extensive multimedia user , this is one of the most favorable feature for me.
Believe me , you can't find any other device with such great Sound quality in this price segment , it's almost like flagship devices ..
Both the speakers are adequately loud.

3. Battery :
As a person who's shifting from a normal 60Hz Device phone , i was very worried about the battery life of this device at 120Hz but it surprised me very well ..
Initially i thought i would need to switch to 60Hz for better battery life for daily usage.
But I didn't even thought this device would give this much great battery life at 120Hz.
At 120Hz , I am getting around 7 hours of minimum SOT ( Screen on Time ).
The maximum SOT i got at 120Hz is 9Hours 13 minutes.
I didn't checked battery life at 60Hz because i didn't use it at 60Hz even a single day . The battery life is Excellent.

4. Rear Cameras :
I am not a very good photographer or something , i am just an ordinary person who use camera occasionally.
I was very excited to use the telephoto lens which only can be found on flagship devices and it performs very well..
Added Some Camera Samples above ( Pic 1 : Ultrawide , Pic 2 : Telephoto [ Pic may not be clear as it was when taken due to compression of the image while uploading )
Both the three Cameras ( Primary + Ultrawide + Telephoto ) performs very well.
If you're a camera guy you should definitely check this out.

5. Performance & RAM Management :
I'm not a gamer , I use my device for daily usage of social media , ott platforms , Calls , messages etc. but i use it extremely.
I didn't faced any kind of heating issues with the device until now.
Also ,Ram management of the Device is excellent , I am a person who uses 4-5 apps
background at single time and i didn't have any issues of closing down the apps .

6. ONE UI :
I was a stock Android guy , but One UI actually surprised me , it is very well optimised and very user-friendly for single hand usage..
initial days i found it little hard to use the stock menu of one Ui but I'm now got used to it.
PS : I didn't found any kind of ads on my device as i didn't sign up or used any samsung Apps.

7. Build Quality :
Even though its back is made up of plastic , the overall build quality is super Premium the Aluminium frame gives us a feel like using a flagship device..

8. Future Proof :
The device has 9 5G Bands , IP68 Rating , Wireless Charging which are very hard to find on any device in this price bracket.
IP68 & Wireless Charging are mostly only found on Flagship Devices . Its good to see samsung brings it at lower price.
This is the best future proof device as of now.

So these are the Major pros i noticed as of now .
Now let's move to the Cons.

Cons :
1. NO HDR SUPPORT ON NETFLIX :
As an extensive multimedia user , i found it very frustrating. even mid range devices offering HDR support on Netflix , Samsungs Flagship Killer doesn't have HDR support.
IT WILL NOT BE FIXED VIA OTA UPDATE .

2. No 256GB Variant :
This is actually not a problem for most of the people but as a power user who uses Dual sim , i found it little difficult.
But if you're a single sim user , luckily it have hybrid solution ..
so you can use a Sim card + expandable memory card ...

3. Gorilla Glass 3 :
Other competitors are providing atleast GG5 in this price range. But S20 FE 5G has just GG3 ( Which also I'm not sure as it is not mentioned officially anywhere ).
But at the end of the day , GLASS IS GLASS & IT WILL BROKE.

4. No headphone Jack :
It is not any kind of unusual thing .
most of the phones above 30K segment doesn't have headphone jack.
So we have to buy 3.5mm to Type C adapter , type c earphones or bluetooth solutions .
Note : Only Buy original Samsung type c adapter else it may not support.

5. No 25W charger :
It is not actually a con for me as i prefer Low watt charger which is good for battery health and beneficial for long term usage .
but it may be a con for you ,
Although the device supports 25W charging . Only 15W charger is provided inside the box .. They should have given 25W inside the box.
I didn't have any issues with 15W charger but it would be great if they bundle it with 25W as competitors are way ahead in terms of charging speed.
For the reference of Charging speed ,
Both 15W & 25W will full charge the device almost at the same time but using 25W you can get about 50% within 30 minutes where as 30% with 15W charger.
Full charge time i usually takes is 1hour and 35 minutes.

6. Front Camera :
I am not a selfie guy , but if you're a person who's looking for a selfie device just don't buy it . it's not like the front camera quality is really bad or anything but it's not even near to the rear camera quality and you can find better selfie smartphones in this price range

CONCLUSION :
If you're a person who wants a device for normal day to day usage with good battery life , great rear cameras , great performance , better software support , better build quality and use it for more than 3 years & the cons mentioned above doesn't bother you
Just buy it , I am sure you won't be disappointed.; It's been about 15 days since I got this phone. I got it for 29990 on prime day sale. For the price it's good.
Pros :
1. Camera. Coming from Poco X2, the camera quality on this is amazing according to the price. It gives you good colours, contrast, focus, and everything that you want. It has OIS which is very apparent while recording. At 4k60 the stability is worse. But set it to 1080p60 and the videos will be amazingly stable. And the main advantage of OIS other than stable video is GREAT night mode shots. Hold the phone stable for a while and along with OIS you will get great photos with accurate colors and nice exposure. Attached samples.

2. Display : Absolutely best. Samsung displays are the best. 120hz FHD. Flows smoothly. Colors and calibration is top notch. Brightness is good but I felt it's a little insufficient under direct sunlight. It's visible but could be better.
3. OneUI : The main reason for upgrading to this phone was software. OneUI4.0 is the absolute best android skin right now. It has way too many customisations in it and let's you personalise your phone to a very high degree. Like there's a feature to read out the name of the person who's calling if your wearing headphones. It took me 3 days to fully go through all the settings and change them to my needs. Also Knoxx security is a special mention. Knoxx security is a software and hardware feature in samsung phones which protects your phone from all kinds of attacks and keeps your data safe. Even if it gets stolen you can remotely delete all your data. Secure folder allows you to store data in a separate storage. And many more such good features. While being a very feature rich and storage heavy skin, it still feels very very smooth and fast to use. Unlike MIUI or other skins, it doesn't stutter much and bugs are less.
There are many other small pros like good stereo speakers. Nice premium build quality. Good data and wifi speeds. Other such features that you won't notice but definitely make a difference in your experience.

Cons
1. Software. I know I said it's a pro but I say this in the aspect of updates. This phone was launched in 2021 March in India and samsung promises 3 year android version updates and 1 additional year of security updates. But there's a lot of confusion regarding if or not this phone will receive Android 14. It will receive A13 for sure. There's a lot of debate on what they will do with14 because of global version launch date being earlier and yada yada. Basically the phones life maybe 2.5 to 3 years if they give a14. But 1.5 to 2 if not. I researched on the Internet a few people say that it will receive a14 while I was few say it's not. It's hard to say who's correct. So assume it's not getting a14 if you are going for it.
2. Battery. The battery on this phone is 4500mah and it's good enough for a days use. But that's because I use it lightly. Not much online streaming. No gaming light social media and other usual stuff. If you use it even a tad bit more heavily, you will run out within a day. If you're going outside for the better part of a day,like a day trip to somewhere nearby,it's better keep a power bank handy. In terms of Screen on time numbers, I once got 7 hours of sot on light usage, 1 hr YouTube and 1.5 hr streaming. I was at home and used wifi all the time.
I got 3 hrs sot when I went outside for a day trip. I took many photos and videos and the phone shutdown before I could reach home. On a mixed use day, you can get 4.5 to 5.5 hours of sot.

Final verdict : The life of the phone in terms of Software Support is not great but you will get on time updates and almost no bugs in the software. So if you want to buy it you can and exchange it after maybe 2 years for other models. But if you planning on using it for longer than 2 years, better avoid it. In the upcoming diwali and dussera sales, the price might further drop to 25k even. I am just speculating but keep in mind your requirements and go accordingly.
As always amazing delivery by Amazon.; The product arrived opened. It was supposed to be new; To correct my review, the placement of the sim and memory disk happens in the same slot. The 2 are placed back to back in the holder. Hope this helps.
I'm very happy with this phone."

Here’s why I love it:

Design and Feel:
First off, it looks and feels premium. The sleek design and solid build make it feel way more expensive than it actually is. It's comfortable to hold and use, which is a big plus.

Display:
The screen is gorgeous. The AMOLED display is bright and vibrant, making everything from videos to games look fantastic. Plus, the high refresh rate makes scrolling and animations super smooth.

Performance:
Even though it has a weaker processor compared to other upper mid-range smartphones, the performance is still really good. Apps open quickly, and multitasking is a breeze. I’ve played some pretty graphics-heavy games on it, and it handles them surprisingly well.

Camera:
The camera setup is really impressive. Photos come out clear and vibrant, even in low light. The extra lenses for wide-angle shots and close-ups add a lot of versatility. It’s perfect for snapping great photos on the go.

Battery Life:
Battery life is solid. It easily lasts all day with heavy use, and the fast charging is a lifesaver when you’re in a hurry. No more waiting around for your phone to charge!

Software:
HyperOs is smooth and feature-packed. It takes a bit to get used to if you’re coming from another brand, but it’s intuitive and has a lot of useful features.

Overall, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ is a fantastic choice if you want a high-quality phone without spending a fortune. It delivers great performance, a beautiful display, and a top-notch camera all at an affordable price. Definitely recommend it!

Bonus: There's no heating issue observed when doing demanding tasks!; First of all let's go with the pros
Display: the best thing I liked about this device is it's display am first time using an amoled curved display and it's soo good it's super smooth with 120hz and the colors are good too and within a week this device fall from about 6 feet and 3-4 times and there was not even a scratch it shows the victus protection does it's job well
• some of the users claim that the 120 watts is not working it's taking about 50 mins but actually if you try to charge the device out of the box it will shows that 120w quick charge but you need to go to settings>battery and switch on the boost charging then only it gives you true 120w potential in 19 mins
• I had test the device dipped in water for 15 mins and still there is no issues found so the ip68 also works good
• And i got and update from miui to xiaomi hyperos
And the ui is also super smooth without any bugs found
• and about gaming the device gives a smooth experience I played freefire in max settings in high fps and still I got about 50fps and i tried e-football ect.. And the device heats up a bit still not overheating in gaming I didn't found any shutters or lags it works smooth
Cons:
I think this stuff is a bit overpriced
The camera is not up to the mark in these price range
But still it can be fixed with a software update
And the battery drains fast I don't think it's 5000 mah my 5 yrs old vivo gives more backup than this but still 120w just full in 19 mins
And the other features are good about these device the cons can be just fixed by an update and after all i love these phone don't mind the negative comments just go for it and i have a suggestion it's bit over priced so you can buy it on offer times and it's not an performance oriented device if you are a gamer or looking that types of phne you can go for iqoo neo 9 Or something and that's all about these device I think this review may help you and i I'll update if I faced any prblms thank you😊; I am using REDMI NOTE 13 PRO+ since last one month. Totally satisfied with the performance of the device. Display is very good and smooth. 100W Fast charging is excellent. Battery life is very good. Both the camera front and rare is beautiful. It gives some great picture even at low light. This is the most value for money phone available in the market.; When I opened my box, it has some query but no one is taking responsibility to resolve or replace it . It has battery drain issue and again camera is not at all good. Redmi note 9 has batter camera than this phone; Heating in nirmal usage, Fast charging not working while using the phone this is very irritating thing, Laging if it is using 120 refresh rate. Not smooth. Display is good. Camera is good but not extra ordinary performance. Weight is also heavy. I dont recommend.; A very good phone camera is very smooth In 60fps .. night shoot is not good this is day camera . Charging very fast within 25 min battery full; Superb phone in this budget; Sometimes there is a lag issue and battery is kinda bad .Remaining else all good; منتج سييييئ جدا ولا يعمل وقد طلبت ارجاعه واسترداد المبلغ ولم اعهد ذلك من سوق ضخم كأمزون لتني اثق بمبيعاته ولكن صدمت هذه المرة"

Battery is superior and lasts more than 24hours with normal usage. Camera output is very good. Overall build quality is excellent. Super fast and butter smooth in terms of performance, toggling between applications, connecting to wifi... Worth the money & great device!!; I highly recommend the OnePlus 12R for anyone seeking a smartphone with exceptional battery life, seamless gaming performance, and a stunning display.
Pros:
• The battery life is incredibly durable, ensuring you can go through the day without worrying about running out of power.
• The ProXDR display delivers high-quality visuals that are both vivid and immersive.
• Gaming and navigating the UI are lag-free experiences.
• The inclusion of an IR blaster adds convenience for controlling various devices.
• SuperVOOC Charging.
• The curved display and elegant design make the OnePlus 12R visually striking.
• The ultra-responsive fingerprint sensor enhances security and ease of access.
• Powered by the flagship Snapdragon 8Gen2 Processor, the phone delivers top-notch performance.
• The Raintouch Display feature ensures usability even in wet conditions.
Cons:
• While the camera performance is decent, it could have been improved for better image quality.
• The absence of a telephoto lens.
• Wireless charging capability is missing, which may disappoint some users.

Overall, the OnePlus 12R stands out as an excellent choice for those prioritizing battery life, gaming performance, and display quality in a smartphone.; Best in class. Charging speed with 100w hypercharge is awesome. Camera quality good (room for improvement in this budget). Touch always smooth. Battery backup up to the mark in 4G network backup upto 20hrs while in 5G is about 12-16hrs which is good, Battery drains faster after 50% as compared to 100-50% But still good as hypercharger cover that issue. Gaming experience is good with 120hz refresh rate.; Awesome display.... Super fast performance.... Battery life and charging speed are excellent for the price....
Overall satisfactory product.....; very nice mobile fast and superb picture quality. display looks also very clear quality. Got very nice buyback value of my one old mobile phone . Value for money.; The call quality is very bad as per the other person. I suppose the mic is poor quality. The quality varies with different applications. Could not find settings for adjusting in car. The phone or speakers doesn't work if you are in car. Even if the bluetooth is switched off. It is the worst ever phone. Never had such trouble using a phone. I am quite busy and does not have time to keep working on settings. Such a crape and waste of money.; Initially reviews were not open for this product. I was waiting to post this. It's a sturdy phone. I met with an accident with this phone in my packet. But no scratch on the phone.
Battery is a beast. 3 days on a smart phone is beyond expectations.
Floating apps higher RAM and internal storage area added advantage.
Above all the look is so brand. Everyone had a wow effect on seeing the spectacular raised camera finishing at the rear
This is my first phone in higher segment. I switched from Samsung series to One plus because of pricing. But Made the right decision.
Powerful phone.; Everything is good except the front camera which is very bad 😞

Apart from that everything is good & works seamlessly

If you are not a selfie person then go for it otherwise choose OnePlus 12 or Samsung phone for good pictures"

So, thanks a lot to Amazon.; **Samsung Galaxy M15 5G Review:**

**Pros:**

1. **5G Connectivity:** The inclusion of 5G support future-proofs the device, ensuring faster download and upload speeds as 5G networks become more prevalent.

2. **Powerful Performance:** Equipped with a high-performance chipset and ample RAM, the Galaxy M15 5G delivers smooth multitasking and gaming experiences without lag.
But sometimes little lag while heavy use and in games like BGMI.

3. **Impressive Display:** The device boasts a vibrant and immersive AMOLED display with rich colors and deep blacks, making it ideal for multimedia consumption and gaming.

4. **Long-lasting Battery:** With a large battery capacity, the Galaxy M15 5G offers excellent battery life, easily lasting through a full day of heavy usage. But you will get this without charger in the box . That a bad thing

5. **Versatile Camera System:** The device features a versatile camera setup, including multiple lenses for capturing a variety of scenes with average details & qualities.

**Cons:**

1. **Plastic Build:** Despite its premium features, the Galaxy M15 5G sports a plastic build, which may not feel as premium as devices with glass or metal constructions.

2. **Bloatware:** Like many Samsung devices, the Galaxy M15 5G comes preloaded with a suite of apps and services, some of which may be unnecessary and take up valuable storage space.

3. **Average camera Performance:** While the camera performs well in most lighting conditions, its performance in low-light scenarios may not be as impressive compared to other devices with dedicated night mode features.

Overall, the Samsung Galaxy M15 5G offers a compelling package with its 5G connectivity, powerful average performance, and impressive display. However, its plastic build, lack of performance may deter some potential buyers. Nonetheless, for users seeking a mid-range device with 5G capabilities, the Galaxy M15 5G is worth considering.; It's an awful phone. Please do not buy it. The touch screen is terrible. Have to touch 5-6 times sometimes for it to work, it's very frustrating. The screen flickers every now and then. The camera is average at best. The speaker is bad. And its quite heavy. I really regret it. I'm a person who hates to change the phone, i miss my old phone even more now The only good thing is that it charges fast and battery lasts a fair amount if time. Am gonna exchange it as soon as possible.; I got the one with 8GB RAM. Display is great. 4 Years of OS updates from Samsung. And Great Battery Life. Camera is also Nice. Nothing to complain here. It's been 1 month & I think It has been a great purchase 👌🏼.; best battery life and 5G, better performance, good display , average camera , bad sound and build, final verdict - go for it , if in exchange or offer.; Picture quality, sound quality, everything thing is beyond expectations in this price, charging is moderate speed but battery backup is better than any other in the segment. Phone is a little heavy due to large battery. Camera quality is reasonable. Software support also given upto Android 18 and another 1 year for security updates.; ; Worst product
Sound quality is not so much better, hanging too much, backside panel is plastic after 1 or 2 hours it will be heating, photos okay okay, in that budget, the device is just for basic usage..
I want to share the experience..
I have ordered on summer sales, and they said the free charger is provided, but the charger is not present in the delivery package, i have contacted customer care several times but each time they are saying it is my mistake to order, they are not accepting the mistake from their side, at one time the customer care associate listened the issue and has transferred to technical team, and this team transfered to the specialised team, and after 3 to 5 minutes they cut the call,this is all repeated for several times."

5. **Versatile Camera System:** The device features a versatile camera setup, including multiple lenses for capturing a variety of scenes with average details & qualities.

**Cons:**

1. **Plastic Build:** Despite its premium features, the Galaxy M15 5G sports a plastic build, which may not feel as premium as devices with glass or metal constructions.

2. **Bloatware:** Like many Samsung devices, the Galaxy M15 5G comes preloaded with a suite of apps and services, some of which may be unnecessary and take up valuable storage space.

3. **Average camera Performance:** While the camera performs well in most lighting conditions, its performance in low-light scenarios may not be as impressive compared to other devices with dedicated night mode features.

Overall, the Samsung Galaxy M15 5G offers a compelling package with its 5G connectivity, powerful average performance, and impressive display. However, its plastic build, lack of performance may deter some potential buyers. Nonetheless, for users seeking a mid-range device with 5G capabilities, the Galaxy M15 5G is worth considering.; It's an awful phone. Please do not buy it. The touch screen is terrible. Have to touch 5-6 times sometimes for it to work, it's very frustrating. The screen flickers every now and then. The camera is average at best. The speaker is bad. And its quite heavy. I really regret it. I'm a person who hates to change the phone, i miss my old phone even more now The only good thing is that it charges fast and battery lasts a fair amount if time. Am gonna exchange it as soon as possible.; I got the one with 8GB RAM. Display is great. 4 Years of OS updates from Samsung. And Great Battery Life. Camera is also Nice. Nothing to complain here. It's been 1 month & I think It has been a great purchase 👌🏼.; best battery life and 5G, better performance, good display , average camera , bad sound and build, final verdict - go for it , if in exchange or offer.; Picture quality, sound quality, everything thing is beyond expectations in this price, charging is moderate speed but battery backup is better than any other in the segment. Phone is a little heavy due to large battery. Camera quality is reasonable. Software support also given upto Android 18 and another 1 year for security updates.; ; Worst product
Sound quality is not so much better, hanging too much, backside panel is plastic after 1 or 2 hours it will be heating, photos okay okay, in that budget, the device is just for basic usage..
I want to share the experience..
I have ordered on summer sales, and they said the free charger is provided, but the charger is not present in the delivery package, i have contacted customer care several times but each time they are saying it is my mistake to order, they are not accepting the mistake from their side, at one time the customer care associate listened the issue and has transferred to technical team, and this team transfered to the specialised team, and after 3 to 5 minutes they cut the call,this is all repeated for several times."

This mobile touch Working very smooth. Value of money; Pros -
1. 256gb + 4gb configuration
2. Decent performance
3. Looks stunning
4. Battery backup is ok but can be optimized with update
5. Above average speaker
6. Camera in daylight or in bright environment is acceptable
7. The provided case is really good.
8. 360 degree flashlight is cool
9. Display's viewing angles and overall quality is satisfactory

Cons -
1. FEW BASIC FEATURES LIKE DOUBLE TAP TO TURN ON AND OFF SCREEN, 3 FINGER SCREENSHOT ETC ARE MISSING WHICH IS VERY ANNOYING. THESE FEATURES ARE VERY BASIC AND I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW COME ITEL REMOVED IT AND WHY?
2. LOW LIGHT CAMERA PERFORMACE IS REALLY BAD.
3. PLAYSTORE AND YOUTUBE ARE NOT PROPERLY OPTIMIZED BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU ARE JUST SCROLLING IN THEM, THE PHONE STUTTERS AND HANGS WHICH NEEDS TO BE FIXED.
4. BATTERY BACKUP AUTOMATICALLY GETS REDUCED SOMETIMES WHICH ALSO NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

ITEL TEAM REALLY NEEDS TO PROVIDE ONE UPDATE ASAP TO FIX THESE MENTIONED DRAWBACKS BECAUSE SUCH BASIC FEATURES IF ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY OR ARE MISSING THEN PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO RECOMMEND THIS DEVICE TO OTHERS WITH FULL CONFIDENCE.

IF THEY FIX THESE ISSUES, THIS DEVICE WILL LITERALLY KILL THE 6-8K BUDGET SEGMENT. PLEASE FIX THEM ASAP.

(Please note all these pros and cons are mentioned considering the killer price at which it comes); I like this is mobile, this mobile desgin is very good, camera quality is too good, back side look is very cool & fabulous, bettery performence is very good, sound quality is also very good. This mobile touch Working very smooth. Value of money; Overall I am not happy with the performance of this iTel A70 moble phone.

Pros:
1. Very affordable
2. ROM and RAM are more than any comparable mobile of same price.
3. Screen resolution is quite good
4. Sound volume is okay though there is only one speaker at the bottom.
5. Overall build quality is good.

Cons:
1. Network connectivity is poor
2. Screen brightness is low compared to other models.
3. Has only one microphone, so cannot record in stereo.

I had applied for a return/refund for the product, but came to know that, as per their policy, it cannot be returned. They arranged for an inspection of the mobile to verify the problems at my place. An inspection agent called me up and asked me to provide the OTP which had been sent to me in my email. The email instructed me as follows - ""Please share the Job Start PIN with Service expert only after they arrive at your location. Do not share over call"". But the agent kept insisting for the PIN on call, saying that he would make sure that I get a refund. I finally gave him the OTP which was a big mistake. He made a report to Amazon that the issue had been resolved. This is a fraud being commited by these agents, I request everyone NOT TO PROVIDE PIN/OTP ON CALL. I am now stuck with a sub-standard mobile phone which I can't return for a better product. It is a shame that Amazon is happily selling these mobiles and refusing to return the product! AVOID BUYING THIS MOBILE PHONE if you can afford to spend Rs.1000 to Rs.2000 more.

Edit: After using the mobile for sometime now I feel that it is okay for light daily use like YouTube, WhatsApp, Facebook and general surfing, provided you have a strong WiFi signal. Keeping in view the affordable price of this phone, the 4GB RAM and 128GB ROM size is more than what we can desire. I have been using it for Facebook live sessions without much problems.; camera quality best, wide display , fast charging, battery backup good, touch is working smoothly, light weight, connectivity also good; Memory 256 is very good, charging to battery taking more than 3hrs.

At first I was little sceptical about how things would go at this price range. I have used Vivo Nokia and Samsung at > Lava O2 budget and to be honest I am happy with this phone
Here are the pros of this phone:
Battery- 5000 mAh is good and lasts minimum of 7 hrs on heavy use and easily lasts a day on rough use
Charging time: 0-100% in nearly 2 hrs . Great! 4/5
Sound quality: sound quality is good but it doesn't really be hearable at low volume . A slight downgrade 3/5
Screen: To be honest, this has the best screen in this range or even above . Even my friends who owned mobile phones at the range of 15,000-30,000 had praised the screen of this phone. The punch hole display is a cherry on top of the cake. I could even see the screen at outdoors without any issues. Great! 5/5
Performance: The phone has a 8+8 combination of Ram and 128 gb ROM. I have tried various high end games on this phone and it's running good. Even it shows 30-40 Fps in COD mobile, but it doesn't feel like it,means it runs very smooth 5/5
I did also play solo leveling arise, Clash of clans,clash royale ,Bgmi ,FF , Farlight and asphalt series. All ran good in this phone . Best!
Storage: Imagine I have a lot of games in this phone simultaneously. Like all the above mentioned. I even have downloaded the expansion pack of some of the games completely. Still I have 50% of storage left. Means the storage system is great! 5/5
Camera: the camera setup is of 50Mp primary sensor with another one may be of potriat ig . But the camera is great . I had some very good photos but Amazon isn't letting me upload them . It has various camera modes and a good selfie sensor. Good! 4/5

Now for the cons:
Camera : After the update I got this problem . The camera lags while taking videos or photos. But in the gallery it is good. I hope the camera is maintained good in future updates
Charging issues: Not much issues but the phone gets very hot and thanks to the glass back 🙂 it just acts like salt sprinkled on a bruise
Device: Only after update I saw this problem. Sometimes when I open the app, the app suddenly closes and also closes each and every open tabs. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible
Touch sensitivity: Sometimes when I am grinding in fps games . When I press the attack button I have to press twice first as the button itself becomes unresponsive at first only. This has happened multiple times leading into losing the match💔

Overall the phone is great . Please resolve the issues seen after update as soon as possible. Kudos!; Nice Phone,Good Bounceback by Lava,
Phone Looks Good,Light weight and Working Smooth...Overall Very Good Smartphone In this Price Range...; I have purchased this LAVA O2 mobile, but it's not reached our expectations. I should replace the mobile. The main issue was call voice is not audible. There is some issue in the mobile. Looking forward to hearing from you positive response.
Overall the mobile is not good. Please replace the mobile.; Overall nice phone with regards to its design, performance, display, sound quality and battery. Very nice made in india phone at such price.; Very good 4G phone, with smooth finish and touch. Very good build quality. Stylish design.

Likes :
1. Proudly Indian
2. Clean Android 13. No bloatware. It's stock Android.
3. Premium glass back design.
4. Ultra smooth touch screen.
5. No lags as of now.
6. Fast fingerprint sensor.
8. Big memory inthis price (8GB, 128GB).
9. It's charging very fast.

Not likes:
1. May be better images expected with 50MP. But ok in this price. Need improvement in camera app.
Update1: updated and now camera is good.

It's truly competition to other brands.
Go for LAVA. Don't let your money go out of India.

#ProudlyIndian; Battery's drained in 6-7hrs, speakers volume is very low in compare to the Vivo phone.
Looks and screen is good. camera good; I was looking for phone for my Generative AI development work where I can memory for my Apps rather bloatware using that memory. Initially when I saw it there was no review but it was mentioned 8GB RAM and bloatware free Android Experience so I picked up and this phone has surprised me.

Here are few good points.
1) Bloatware free android experience and Only google Apps and two Lava Apps along with system apps.
2) Standby time it quite impressive
3) Phone design is also quite impressive
4) There is free phone cover and Phone charger which most of other companies are not providing now a days
5) Currently I am running large language model with Ollama and llama.cpp with models like llama3, phi3, mistral, sqlcoder, starcoder, gemma:2b, qwen and all other models ranging from 900 mb to 4.7gb size.
6) python, nodejs, open source web apps also working quite fast.

Considering All above in 7999 INR after coupon is great deal not only for user but also for developer, I expect LAVA to bring bloatware free experience with 16 and 32GB with 512/1TB internal memory in future at competitive price so that we can keep running bigger technology in Android mobile.

Thank you LAVA.; Lava O2 is the most fastest and amazing phone under 8k. I bought it for 7,499 in sale. It's performance has not disappointed me for once. Alltho am giving 4 stars because phone has heating issues. I've been using it for a few days so here's my opinion on the topics :-

• Battery life : Average for a 8k Phone can easily give a 6hr run time while playing games.
• Quality : Build Quality is 10/10. Phone gives an expensive look. Overall good.
• Camera : Average, back camera can be improved.
• Sound Quality : Sound quality is good too and speakers are fine as well.
• Gaming : Light gaming can be done but playing heavy games like BGMI and COD can cause heating. For normal gaming like roblox, Subway surfer, etc. . It's good.
• Heating : The phone heats up quite fast. It's heating the most while charging.
• Easy to use : It's actually smooth and it's ram is also good which gives a smooth experience.
• RAM and ROM : Compared to other companies, lava gives more ROM and it's 8gb ram is also very efficient. Expandable Ram hasn't been in much use but it's smooth.

You can't expect a 8k Phone to compete iPhone or other expensive phones. It's the best one in the segment. Go for it, it's Indian and efficient."

If service center people will open this mobile than how this mobile is new...it means I purchased a old mobile in new mobole value. what a worst service I am seeing from amazon. seller is sending defective item and amazon dont want to resolve customers issue. very very worst policy made by amazon.; Good; It is very perfect. I like it.; Sound quality and processor is good and camera is average
But the problem is phone's sim automatically loses its signal in 2-3 days and I don't know how it happens. Then I've to restart my phone again and again. Customer care is also not responding; The phone looks a bit bulky.There is a serious connectivity problem. The looks are good. The camera is good."

From its sleek design to its impressive performance, this device has become an indispensable tool in my daily life.

Design and Build Quality:
The design is both modern and ergonomic. Its slim profile and premium materials make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.

Display:
The display is stunning. Whether I'm streaming videos, browsing the web, or playing games, the vibrant colors and sharp resolution never fail to impress.

Performance:
Powered by a robust processor and ample RAM, delivers snappy performance across the board. Apps launch quickly, multitasking is smooth, and even demanding tasks like gaming and photo editing are handled with ease. I've experienced no lag or slowdown, even when running multiple apps simultaneously.

Battery Life:
One of the standout features is its impressive battery life. Even with heavy usage, including streaming videos, browsing social media, and taking photos throughout the day, I consistently get through a full day on a single charge. The fast-charging capability is also a game-changer.

Camera:
The camera is nothing short of phenomenal. Whether I'm capturing landscapes, portraits, or close-up shots, the image quality is consistently excellent. Plus, the front-facing camera is great for selfies and video calls.

Overall Impressions:
In conclusion, the IQOO Z7 PRO has proven itself to be a standout device in the crowded smartphone market. With its premium design, top-notch performance, impressive battery life, and versatile camera system, it ticks all the boxes for what I look for in a mobile phone. Whether you're a casual user or a power user, the IQOO Z7 PRO is sure to impress. Highly recommended.; After using the device for exactly 7 days here's what I found -

Starting first with the design and build quality, the device is quite the looker. It's very thin and lightweight and the curved edges make it very comfortable to hold on for longer periods.
Also the glass sandwich built feels premium.

Next coming to display, the 120 hz curved amoled panel is in one word, splendid. It offers an immersive viewing experience with buttery smooth output. It also supports up to 1300 nits of peak brightness which helps viewing in direct sunlight.

Now, when you buy a IQOO device you don't have to worry about the performance. It shares the typical IQOO dna and is powered by MediaTek dimensity 7200. The processor is very capable in running daily tasks and graphic intensive games. I am not much of a hardcore gamer but so far what I have tested I'm impressed. Games like BGMI, COD, Genshin Impact runs smoothly in this device with good graphic settings. IQOO also has done a job in cooling the processor, it barely gets hot while gaming.

Next coming to camera, it has a 64 megapixel rear sensor which offers very good photos in daylight as well as night time. And the 16 megapixel front sensor is good too. The rear sensor can do 4k 30fps video recording and the front is locked at 1080p 30fps. Now, I am not that much of a camera guy, watching a camera review of this device will surely give you a better idea.

After that I would like to share my thoughts on the battery and charging department. I was a little concerned about the 4600mah battery capacity and the 120hz display combo but surprisingly the battery holds up pretty well. I get easily a whole day of usage with 6-7 hours of screen on time which also includes gaming. The 66w charging adaptor charges the device from 0 to 100 in about 55 minutes which I believe is pretty good.

Coming to network and connectivity, I haven't really got the opportunity to test the 5G connectivity as my local area does no not have 5G network. But 4G plus career aggregation is very constant and it offers good uploading and downloading speeds.

The last thing to talk is about software. The device comes with the latest Funtouch OS 13 based on Android 13 and IQOO has promised 2 years of OS and 3 years of security patches which is decent.
Personally I don't like the Funtouch OS much. I am coming from OneUI and compared to that this OS feels a little bit less lively. The animations are fluid and it also has all the necessary features but it needs more polishing. Do note I haven't faced any bugs in the software but there are a few advertisements which you can turn off and then it becomes a very clean experience. The software experience completely varies from user to user so you might not be bothered by it at well. I just hope the brand polishes their UI more.

Coming to compromises, it only has three which in my case is not much of an issue. It has an avarage vibration motor which doesn't offer flagship like experience. This device comes with a mono speaker which is decent. I'm coming from a device with a single speaker so it doesn't bother me as such. Also instead of the 2mp macro sensor a telephoto or ultrawide angle lens would have been highly appreciated.

In conclusion, it can be said that it is a very good overall package if you can get it at 22k with the card offers. But for 24k it could've been better. It misses a few corners which would have made it perfect under 25k. I hope this review helps you to take a better purchasing decision."

I like the most in the phone is display. I looks very much attractive.
Sound quality also nice. It is very loud and clear.
Camera is also good.
Fingerprint sensor is very fast and very fast responsive.
When comes to connectivity it is very much easy and simple to connect and 5G connection is very fast and it depends on areas of 5G network.
Memory is very nice also it is expandable upto 8 GB so we can expand upto 16 GB
If your budget is upto 15000 go for it.
I have brought this mobile under exchange offer. I have exchanged my old mobile Redmi Note 11.
So I have brought this mobile under at 13000 with exchange offer.
So consider this options while purchasing this mobile; Needs charging once every 24 hours, long charging time, quick charging makes phone hot
Camera not to the mark, poor
Bubble pocket with screen guard within a month
Overall features not good
Owned the redmi 9 max pro which was excellent, value for money
Xaomi concentration on high priced phones; Sound is very poor. Doesn't feels like Dolby Atmos as claimed by Redmi. Getting heated up with very less usage. Remaining everything is good.; Good phone with fast 5g, beautiful screen and lasting battery. Only thing to keep in mind that sum slot is a hybrid one, so you can’t have 2 sims and 1 memory card at same time.; ; Redmi 13-5g phone is very light weight and slim, but Phone is not upto the mark. Phone is overpriced, Battery Drained very fast. Camera is ok. YouTube runs on1440p only, but it should run 4k videos also.; Very good phone.; Pros
It is light weight
Camera is decent quality
Design is catchy
Doesn't freeze or get hanged while using apps
Cons
Battery life is very poor despite being
5000mah.
Gets heated very quickly
Could improve bloatware issue"

So, thanks a lot to Amazon.; **Samsung Galaxy M15 5G Review:**

**Pros:**

1. **5G Connectivity:** The inclusion of 5G support future-proofs the device, ensuring faster download and upload speeds as 5G networks become more prevalent.

2. **Powerful Performance:** Equipped with a high-performance chipset and ample RAM, the Galaxy M15 5G delivers smooth multitasking and gaming experiences without lag.
But sometimes little lag while heavy use and in games like BGMI.

3. **Impressive Display:** The device boasts a vibrant and immersive AMOLED display with rich colors and deep blacks, making it ideal for multimedia consumption and gaming.

4. **Long-lasting Battery:** With a large battery capacity, the Galaxy M15 5G offers excellent battery life, easily lasting through a full day of heavy usage. But you will get this without charger in the box . That a bad thing

5. **Versatile Camera System:** The device features a versatile camera setup, including multiple lenses for capturing a variety of scenes with average details & qualities.

**Cons:**

1. **Plastic Build:** Despite its premium features, the Galaxy M15 5G sports a plastic build, which may not feel as premium as devices with glass or metal constructions.

2. **Bloatware:** Like many Samsung devices, the Galaxy M15 5G comes preloaded with a suite of apps and services, some of which may be unnecessary and take up valuable storage space.

3. **Average camera Performance:** While the camera performs well in most lighting conditions, its performance in low-light scenarios may not be as impressive compared to other devices with dedicated night mode features.

Overall, the Samsung Galaxy M15 5G offers a compelling package with its 5G connectivity, powerful average performance, and impressive display. However, its plastic build, lack of performance may deter some potential buyers. Nonetheless, for users seeking a mid-range device with 5G capabilities, the Galaxy M15 5G is worth considering.; It's an awful phone. Please do not buy it. The touch screen is terrible. Have to touch 5-6 times sometimes for it to work, it's very frustrating. The screen flickers every now and then. The camera is average at best. The speaker is bad. And its quite heavy. I really regret it. I'm a person who hates to change the phone, i miss my old phone even more now The only good thing is that it charges fast and battery lasts a fair amount if time. Am gonna exchange it as soon as possible.; I got the one with 8GB RAM. Display is great. 4 Years of OS updates from Samsung. And Great Battery Life. Camera is also Nice. Nothing to complain here. It's been 1 month & I think It has been a great purchase 👌🏼.; best battery life and 5G, better performance, good display , average camera , bad sound and build, final verdict - go for it , if in exchange or offer.; Picture quality, sound quality, everything thing is beyond expectations in this price, charging is moderate speed but battery backup is better than any other in the segment. Phone is a little heavy due to large battery. Camera quality is reasonable. Software support also given upto Android 18 and another 1 year for security updates.; ; Worst product
Sound quality is not so much better, hanging too much, backside panel is plastic after 1 or 2 hours it will be heating, photos okay okay, in that budget, the device is just for basic usage..
I want to share the experience..
I have ordered on summer sales, and they said the free charger is provided, but the charger is not present in the delivery package, i have contacted customer care several times but each time they are saying it is my mistake to order, they are not accepting the mistake from their side, at one time the customer care associate listened the issue and has transferred to technical team, and this team transfered to the specialised team, and after 3 to 5 minutes they cut the call,this is all repeated for several times."

At first I was little sceptical about how things would go at this price range. I have used Vivo Nokia and Samsung at > Lava O2 budget and to be honest I am happy with this phone
Here are the pros of this phone:
Battery- 5000 mAh is good and lasts minimum of 7 hrs on heavy use and easily lasts a day on rough use
Charging time: 0-100% in nearly 2 hrs . Great! 4/5
Sound quality: sound quality is good but it doesn't really be hearable at low volume . A slight downgrade 3/5
Screen: To be honest, this has the best screen in this range or even above . Even my friends who owned mobile phones at the range of 15,000-30,000 had praised the screen of this phone. The punch hole display is a cherry on top of the cake. I could even see the screen at outdoors without any issues. Great! 5/5
Performance: The phone has a 8+8 combination of Ram and 128 gb ROM. I have tried various high end games on this phone and it's running good. Even it shows 30-40 Fps in COD mobile, but it doesn't feel like it,means it runs very smooth 5/5
I did also play solo leveling arise, Clash of clans,clash royale ,Bgmi ,FF , Farlight and asphalt series. All ran good in this phone . Best!
Storage: Imagine I have a lot of games in this phone simultaneously. Like all the above mentioned. I even have downloaded the expansion pack of some of the games completely. Still I have 50% of storage left. Means the storage system is great! 5/5
Camera: the camera setup is of 50Mp primary sensor with another one may be of potriat ig . But the camera is great . I had some very good photos but Amazon isn't letting me upload them . It has various camera modes and a good selfie sensor. Good! 4/5

Now for the cons:
Camera : After the update I got this problem . The camera lags while taking videos or photos. But in the gallery it is good. I hope the camera is maintained good in future updates
Charging issues: Not much issues but the phone gets very hot and thanks to the glass back 🙂 it just acts like salt sprinkled on a bruise
Device: Only after update I saw this problem. Sometimes when I open the app, the app suddenly closes and also closes each and every open tabs. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible
Touch sensitivity: Sometimes when I am grinding in fps games . When I press the attack button I have to press twice first as the button itself becomes unresponsive at first only. This has happened multiple times leading into losing the match💔

Overall the phone is great . Please resolve the issues seen after update as soon as possible. Kudos!; Nice Phone,Good Bounceback by Lava,
Phone Looks Good,Light weight and Working Smooth...Overall Very Good Smartphone In this Price Range...; I have purchased this LAVA O2 mobile, but it's not reached our expectations. I should replace the mobile. The main issue was call voice is not audible. There is some issue in the mobile. Looking forward to hearing from you positive response.
Overall the mobile is not good. Please replace the mobile.; Overall nice phone with regards to its design, performance, display, sound quality and battery. Very nice made in india phone at such price.; Very good 4G phone, with smooth finish and touch. Very good build quality. Stylish design.

Likes :
1. Proudly Indian
2. Clean Android 13. No bloatware. It's stock Android.
3. Premium glass back design.
4. Ultra smooth touch screen.
5. No lags as of now.
6. Fast fingerprint sensor.
8. Big memory inthis price (8GB, 128GB).
9. It's charging very fast.

Not likes:
1. May be better images expected with 50MP. But ok in this price. Need improvement in camera app.
Update1: updated and now camera is good.

It's truly competition to other brands.
Go for LAVA. Don't let your money go out of India.

#ProudlyIndian; Battery's drained in 6-7hrs, speakers volume is very low in compare to the Vivo phone.
Looks and screen is good. camera good; I was looking for phone for my Generative AI development work where I can memory for my Apps rather bloatware using that memory. Initially when I saw it there was no review but it was mentioned 8GB RAM and bloatware free Android Experience so I picked up and this phone has surprised me.

Here are few good points.
1) Bloatware free android experience and Only google Apps and two Lava Apps along with system apps.
2) Standby time it quite impressive
3) Phone design is also quite impressive
4) There is free phone cover and Phone charger which most of other companies are not providing now a days
5) Currently I am running large language model with Ollama and llama.cpp with models like llama3, phi3, mistral, sqlcoder, starcoder, gemma:2b, qwen and all other models ranging from 900 mb to 4.7gb size.
6) python, nodejs, open source web apps also working quite fast.

Considering All above in 7999 INR after coupon is great deal not only for user but also for developer, I expect LAVA to bring bloatware free experience with 16 and 32GB with 512/1TB internal memory in future at competitive price so that we can keep running bigger technology in Android mobile.

Thank you LAVA.; Lava O2 is the most fastest and amazing phone under 8k. I bought it for 7,499 in sale. It's performance has not disappointed me for once. Alltho am giving 4 stars because phone has heating issues. I've been using it for a few days so here's my opinion on the topics :-

• Battery life : Average for a 8k Phone can easily give a 6hr run time while playing games.
• Quality : Build Quality is 10/10. Phone gives an expensive look. Overall good.
• Camera : Average, back camera can be improved.
• Sound Quality : Sound quality is good too and speakers are fine as well.
• Gaming : Light gaming can be done but playing heavy games like BGMI and COD can cause heating. For normal gaming like roblox, Subway surfer, etc. . It's good.
• Heating : The phone heats up quite fast. It's heating the most while charging.
• Easy to use : It's actually smooth and it's ram is also good which gives a smooth experience.
• RAM and ROM : Compared to other companies, lava gives more ROM and it's 8gb ram is also very efficient. Expandable Ram hasn't been in much use but it's smooth.

You can't expect a 8k Phone to compete iPhone or other expensive phones. It's the best one in the segment. Go for it, it's Indian and efficient."

Its hinge is awesome and overall built quality of this phone is upto the mark. Features are to be accessed and well known about it after few months of use. Screen guard or protector should be provided extra in the box if not easily replaced in the market. According to Indian market this phone is not easily accessible for all customers due to its huge price because it's cost a lot and this is the only weak point for this phone and just because of that it will be found in limited hands. Brand ViVo should reduce it's price for frequent sales.; ; I had used OnePlus open earlier which is a good foldable phone. When Vivo launched X fold 3 pro, it has changed everything and could not resist from buying it. It is much better when compared with Oneplus open in many aspects such as processor, display, fingerprint sensor (dual sensors - one on the outside screen and another on the inside foldable screen), IPX8 water resistant, 50W wireless charging, 100W wired charging, bigger battery (5700 mAh), excellent camera with awesome quality photos under low light, almost invisible hinge. The software too is good (I felt Oneplus open software is slightly better than Vivo X fold 3) with superb striking wallpapers. The price is slightly high when compared to other foldable phones available in the market; however, it is justifiable for the hardware and features provided. Finally, a best foldable phone which is made in India. If you are a fan of foldable phones, just go for it.; Excellent Battery of 5700 Mah, 40 mins for 0 to 100 percent with 100 watt fast charger, supereb display.

So, thanks a lot to Amazon.; **Samsung Galaxy M15 5G Review:**

**Pros:**

1. **5G Connectivity:** The inclusion of 5G support future-proofs the device, ensuring faster download and upload speeds as 5G networks become more prevalent.

2. **Powerful Performance:** Equipped with a high-performance chipset and ample RAM, the Galaxy M15 5G delivers smooth multitasking and gaming experiences without lag.
But sometimes little lag while heavy use and in games like BGMI.

3. **Impressive Display:** The device boasts a vibrant and immersive AMOLED display with rich colors and deep blacks, making it ideal for multimedia consumption and gaming.

4. **Long-lasting Battery:** With a large battery capacity, the Galaxy M15 5G offers excellent battery life, easily lasting through a full day of heavy usage. But you will get this without charger in the box . That a bad thing

5. **Versatile Camera System:** The device features a versatile camera setup, including multiple lenses for capturing a variety of scenes with average details & qualities.

**Cons:**

1. **Plastic Build:** Despite its premium features, the Galaxy M15 5G sports a plastic build, which may not feel as premium as devices with glass or metal constructions.

2. **Bloatware:** Like many Samsung devices, the Galaxy M15 5G comes preloaded with a suite of apps and services, some of which may be unnecessary and take up valuable storage space.

3. **Average camera Performance:** While the camera performs well in most lighting conditions, its performance in low-light scenarios may not be as impressive compared to other devices with dedicated night mode features.

Overall, the Samsung Galaxy M15 5G offers a compelling package with its 5G connectivity, powerful average performance, and impressive display. However, its plastic build, lack of performance may deter some potential buyers. Nonetheless, for users seeking a mid-range device with 5G capabilities, the Galaxy M15 5G is worth considering.; It's an awful phone. Please do not buy it. The touch screen is terrible. Have to touch 5-6 times sometimes for it to work, it's very frustrating. The screen flickers every now and then. The camera is average at best. The speaker is bad. And its quite heavy. I really regret it. I'm a person who hates to change the phone, i miss my old phone even more now The only good thing is that it charges fast and battery lasts a fair amount if time. Am gonna exchange it as soon as possible.; I got the one with 8GB RAM. Display is great. 4 Years of OS updates from Samsung. And Great Battery Life. Camera is also Nice. Nothing to complain here. It's been 1 month & I think It has been a great purchase 👌🏼.; best battery life and 5G, better performance, good display , average camera , bad sound and build, final verdict - go for it , if in exchange or offer.; Picture quality, sound quality, everything thing is beyond expectations in this price, charging is moderate speed but battery backup is better than any other in the segment. Phone is a little heavy due to large battery. Camera quality is reasonable. Software support also given upto Android 18 and another 1 year for security updates.; ; Worst product
Sound quality is not so much better, hanging too much, backside panel is plastic after 1 or 2 hours it will be heating, photos okay okay, in that budget, the device is just for basic usage..
I want to share the experience..
I have ordered on summer sales, and they said the free charger is provided, but the charger is not present in the delivery package, i have contacted customer care several times but each time they are saying it is my mistake to order, they are not accepting the mistake from their side, at one time the customer care associate listened the issue and has transferred to technical team, and this team transfered to the specialised team, and after 3 to 5 minutes they cut the call,this is all repeated for several times."

Ram management is excellent. watching videos and multimedia experience is a pleasure. battery backup is great. only con in camera department is there is no 2x or 3x zoom camera. primary camera is fantastic. there is no IP rating. loudspeakers are pretty loud and clear. been receiving regular updates. so far very solid experience from iqoo; A perfect phone at this price range. The iQOO Neo 9 Pro is a mid-range flagship phone with a focus on performance. It has a powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor up to 12GB of RAM and a 144Hz LTPO AMOLED display. Although 144 hz feature is only available for gaming. The camera system is decent, but not great, with a 50MP primary sensor and an 8MP ultra-wide sensor, the main 50 MP sensor is good enough for day to day nornal photography and 8 MP sensor is average, battery life is good, and the phone supports fast charging and the speed of charging is mesmerizing. The most important thing to mention that unlike other brands you will get 120W charger in the box which is best thing. Moreover, there are some pre-installed applications in the phone which I think don't need to be there. Overall, the iQOO Neo 9 Pro is a good option for gamers and power users who are looking for a phone with a lot of performance for the price.
Here are some key pros and cons of the iQOO Neo 9 Pro:
Pros:
* Powerful performance
* Smooth display
* Good battery life
* Fast charging
Cons:
* Average camera system
* Not the cleanest user interface; PictureQuality :- By saying my pictures I have uploaded on Instagram or other social media all are asking that are they captured by using Apple iPhone ? And I have captured some pictures for my relatives and my neighbours and pressure on best social media the same asking their friends too. .. that's a shocking and wonderful review for me. I have used my eye controlled o
Portrait 2x mode for capturing portrait nearby good pictures... Also this phone battery is good by using from the dawn to dusk, battery drains but it full within 10 to 15 minutes.
Continuous using this phone with internet not tempting hot feel .
It selfie camera have no flash but it is quite good..
Android 14 and all the apps are working hood with the enough I have and expandable Ram option.
Also it's support infrared , so we can use this phone as a remote to TV DTH, AC, FAN AND MANY IR SUPPORTING devices without any third party applications.
It's processor is feeling much good Snapdragon 8 gen 2.
Style and finishing also quite impressive, smooth and good function.
Some small negatives :- this has only internal storage no memory card support
3.5 mm earphone chat is not available, al3so latest all phones are r supporting C type audio wired earphones. Otherwise you need to purchase AC type to 3.5 m converter for your existing earphones.
It supports multiple devices and change over connection are also good manner.
Kuchh supports 2.4 and 5G Wi-Fi also we can customise 5G Wi-Fi hotspot.
Also built in screen recording option available.
In designs slim: & compatible no much weight feel.; Yes! while charging it gets warm, it doesn't bother me because it is charging with 120 watt adaptor, many people complaining because they might switched from 10-20 watt charging speed!
While gaming it stays cooler, you will not be noticing any huge amount of heat or any performance drop, constant performance 85-90fps in bgmi.
Front camera is decent for selfies but not good for videos.
Back camera is better, good for both videos and photos!
I just personally felt, it gives better battery back while ultra gaming mode is on(all the time), compared to when it is off!
Just turn off the notification and uninstall the app you don't like, you're good to go!
I don't have any complain with the product, It fulfills my requirement!
Value for money product!; Likes: The phone has got good specifications for the price. It can handle any kind of task thrown at it. The back is vegan leather (only on red and white models) and feels amazing to look, hold and feel, with a nice grip. Battery is large enough to last a full day even on the most busiest of day. Camera performance is great during the day and night, comparable with most flagship phones. Screen is sharp and colours are bright and vivid even in sun.

Dislikes: Gets a little warm while charging with supplied charger. However older slow chargers works well of you are not in a hurry. The phone doesn't have NFC, and hence you cannot use features supported, including tap and pay."

Best phone in this budget with loads of feature

* Loved the design which is very premium, like Iphone

*Best 50 MP Rear Camera which has impressive results in night photography &

*32 MP selfie cameras is also very impressive.

* No lag in the performance & gaming as it comes with MTK G85 processor.

*Liked the dynamic port feature, where notification can be seen on top of the screen

*Liked the sound quality of Spark 20,as it comes with dual speaker. Where competition is providing only single speaker.; First off, the design is pretty sweet. It's got a premium look.

The display is also pretty dope. It's a 6.6-inch Dot-in Display.

The camera is pretty good too. It's got a 50MP main camera for taking some sick daylight photos. And the 32MP front camera is great for taking selfies.

In terms of performance, it's got a Helio G85 processor, which is pretty decent. And it's got 8GB of RAM, so you can multitask like a boss.

The battery is also pretty solid. It's got a 5000mAh battery, so you can use it all day without worrying about it dying. And it supports 18W Type-C charging, so you can juice it up pretty quickly.

Overall, the Tecno Spark 20 is a great choice if you're looking for a budget-friendly smartphone. It's got everything you need and more.

Thanks; They have given good features in this price range , very smooth in operation, touch quality is good, camera is also good

Worth it; Nice and fast mobile, using for personal work.; It's a worst item I've purchased with you the phone is not up to the mark the flash light is still an issue and bettry is charging very slowly phone is getting heat up while outside , I've a big history of purchasing but this time it's very poor and the thing is no one helped me during my seven days return period and they wasted my return policy ,time and money I will never purchase anything from Amazon in. Future; Well done Tecno at this price good specs. I previously had Tecno Pova 2,3, and 4. Display, build quality, features ,camera, all at par with this segment. Best thing Tecno has improved with this device is that display color calibration is on point, no extra saturation noticed. Color tone can be adjusted which is good.
Only concern is that back panel at the centre vibrates a lot with sound played from speakers even at 50 % volume. Other than this would rate 8/10 for this device. Go for it.; Good; Camera is better iin compare to similar phone, good durable sleek model, battery charging is bit slow but complete Charing in around 1 hour from zero."

My review: if you want to click DSLR level pictures and record videos just go for it if you like compact devices.
If you want to do hardcore things on phone like gaming and video editing etc you should go for oneplus 12r.; ; The Samsung S22 is a smartphone that offers a mix of impressive features alongside a couple of notable drawbacks.

**Battery Life and Heating:** Unfortunately, the S22 falls short in the battery department, requiring 2-3 charges a day for heavy users. Additionally, it tends to heat up noticeably after prolonged usage, which can be concerning for some users.

**Fingerprint Sensor:** On a positive note, the fingerprint sensor on the S22 is excellent, providing fast and reliable authentication.

**Display:** The S22 boasts a stunning 120Hz AMOLED display that supports 4K video playback and HDR10+. With a maximum brightness of 1500 nits, it offers vibrant visuals that enhance the overall viewing experience.

**Sound Quality:** Samsung delivers on audio quality with the S22's stereo speakers, providing immersive sound that surpasses many other smartphones on the market.

**User Interface:** The device runs on One UI 6.1, offering a smooth and intuitive user experience with minimal bloatware applications, enhancing usability.

**Camera:** The camera setup on the S22 is impressive, featuring a 50MP + 12MP + 10MP Triple Rear Camera with OIS and night mode. With a 30x optical zoom and the ability to record 4K videos with both front and rear cameras, it caters to photography enthusiasts.

**Performance:** Powered by the Snapdragon 8Gen 1 processor, the S22 delivers fast and responsive performance, ensuring smooth multitasking and gaming experiences.

**Durability:** Equipped with Gorilla Glass Victus+ and an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance, the S22 offers durability and peace of mind to users.

Overall, the Samsung S22 impresses with its display quality, camera performance, and user interface. However, its limited battery life and tendency to heat up may be significant concerns for potential buyers. If you can overlook these drawbacks, the S22 offers a premium smartphone experience with a plethora of features to enjoy.; There's not much to say about s22. But....

Pros:

1. Good Fingerprint scanner (works well and fast even with water on surface or fingers)
2. A dynamic camera. Portrait image and videos are nice.
3. 2K resolution Amoled screen and 120Hz. Screen does not disappoint in outdoors (max sunlight).
4. One UI works well. Thanks to the fairly powerful processor.
5. Easy to hold. Stylish design.

Cons:

1. A little lightweight.
2. Battery drains quick. (Deal with it)

These are the major Pros and Cons. But depending on the type of user it may vary. All in all it's a very good phone, it's just that if you compare it with the ultra you don't feel it's good deal. But the ultra has it's flaws too.; I'll first deal with the cons coz thats what everyone needs to know before buying

Cons:
* Battery Backup. The phone drains battery a little quicker. I easily saw battery percentage drop by 7% in 5 minutes while booking cabs.
* Charging Speed - Takes almost 1.5 hours to fully charge on 25watt charger. High Time Samsung up their game in terms of chargers and charging time. Oppo Vivo One plus all have moved up to 65W/85W/120W chargers with warp speed. Samsung still stuck at 25W.
* Heating - Phone gets pretty hot while taking photos and using camera / internet for a while. This indirectly drains the battery too.

Pros:
* Feature Loaded Phone. Has so many features that make our day to day work super easy.
* Best UI experience provided by Samsung. Has One UI 4.1
* One of the best Portrait shots I have clicked with this phone.
* Best camera in this segment.
* Premium exterior. Got the Green variant.
* Sleek and Compact. Was using the Z Flip Earlier. Wanted to switch to a smaller phone."

It's running awesome for me as per my use cases. Battery is awesome,
Charging is also awesome,
the processor is awesome too,
Display is super cool for hdr content.
Overall i liked this phone very much. Not like other brands so called environment savers .; Upgraded from 7 to 12r
Pros
1) awesome display
2) performance is good as usual . Handle all the apps well
3) good battery and fast charging. I don't find heating issue while do fast charging
4) call reception is good.
5) camer is okay
6) back cover comes with phone is good

Cons
1) camera need improvement
2) os need improvement
3) screen size is bigger , movie or videos not coming in full screen without zoom

Best phone for display, day to day activities and good battery and durability.; High performance phone with decent photography. Battery backup is not good at all. Some time its screen on time is less than 7 hours with no gaming.
Fingerprint sensor is very fast . Sound quality is also very good. Screen is very smooth. Phone is very clean. Build quality is also good.; Great camera, no heating issues, great performance and best in class battery backup. Getting almost 8 hours of SOT.; ; I have purchased this phone on the first sale and it was my best decision.
In the real world usage this phone exceeds my expectations. I previously used Mi10i, Poco f1 and the main complaint i made was for the OS.
Pros-
1. Smooth performance because of Snapdragon 8gen 2
2. Clean OS
3. Best Display
4. Superb Build Quality
5. Beast Battery Backup
6. Super fast charging
7. Top gaming performance

Cons-
1. Decent Camera
2. Base variant only has 128 gb storage. Atleast 256gb should be provided by oneplus because we are paying 40k for this phone.

Guy's i know Oneplus had a controversy about UFS 4.0 but trust me this is an all-rounder phone. I am happy with my purchase and i was confused between Iqoo Neo 9 pro and Oneplus 12r. Glad i went with this phone because build quality really matters and Iqoo Neo 9 pro has the worst build quality. I dropped my phone often so prefer strong build quality. I didn't dropped this yet so kudos to me. 😂; One of best phone I have ever used. Back camera quality is amazing. Screen display very smooth. Battery life un beatable. Performance 5/5. Appearance eye killing. Over all I will rate 💯.; The OnePlus 12R brings a lot to the table, blending top-notch performance, an eye-catching design, and a stellar camera system. With its OxygenOS, navigating through the device feels smooth and intuitive, enhancing the overall user experience. While it excels in many areas, it falls a bit short on battery life, which could be a concern for heavy users. Additionally, the lack of UFs 3.1 storage might be a downside for those who need extra speed for their files and apps. Nonetheless, it remains a compelling option for anyone seeking a premium smartphone with a blend of style and substance."

Here's a detailed breakdown of my experience:

Design & Build Quality:
The Realme Narzo 70 5G boasts a sleek and modern design. The phone feels premium in hand with its well-constructed build quality. The ergonomics are spot on, making it comfortable to hold and use.

Display:
The 6.67-inch FHD+ Amoled display is vibrant and crisp. Colors are vivid, and the brightness levels are impressive even under direct sunlight. Watching videos and playing games on this screen is a delight.

Performance:
Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7050 processor, this phone easily handles everything. Multitasking is smooth, and I haven't experienced any lag or stutter, even with intensive applications and games. The 5G connectivity is a game-changer, providing super-fast internet speeds.

Battery Life:
The 5000mAh battery is a beast! It easily lasts me a full day with heavy usage, including streaming, gaming, and browsing. The fast charging feature is a huge plus, allowing me to quickly top up the battery when needed.

Camera:
The camera setup is impressive for this price range. The primary 50MP sensor captures detailed and sharp images in good lighting conditions. The night mode works surprisingly well, producing clear and bright photos in low light. The front camera is also excellent for selfies and video calls.

Software:
Realme UI is clean and user-friendly. The customization options are extensive, and I appreciate the lack of bloatware. The regular software updates ensure that the phone remains secure and up-to-date with the latest features.

Value for Money:
Given the features and performance, the Realme Narzo 70 5G offers incredible value for money. It's hard to find a phone that packs so much at this price point.

Conclusion:
Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Realme Narzo 70 5G. It delivers in all aspects, from performance to camera quality and battery life. If you're looking for a reliable and high-performing 5G phone without breaking the bank, I highly recommend the Realme Narzo 70 5G!; The Realme Narzo 70 boasts a beautiful display that is truly impressive. While I'm not a dedicated gamer, I do enjoy casual games occasionally, and I've noticed that the device tends to get a little bit warm during gameplay.

One concern I have is the battery backup. It seems to drain relatively quickly even when I'm using Wi-Fi instead of mobile data, although I'm not entirely sure if this is a consistent issue. On the bright side, the fast charger included with the phone works excellently, quickly recharging the battery.

The camera is decent for its price range, though I suspect there might be other models in this segment with slightly better camera performance. Additionally, the phone comes with some pre-installed bloatware, but you can either uninstall these apps or simply turn off their notifications.

Interestingly, the Realme P1, which is available on Flipkart, is nearly identical to the Narzo 70, which is sold on Amazon. The P1 has slightly higher peak brightness, which might explain its better rating, but otherwise, the two models are virtually the same.; ; I was in search of a good 5g phone. After a lot of research I found this phone. If you want to purchase it go for it. This phone has very fast 45watt charging, has a really great battery, the camera colours and contrast are really perfect, the 120hz refresh rate is really good and seamless, the phone is overall very smooth and sturdy, comes with a great in-built realme launcher which is nice and clean. The Gaming performance is great and doesn't lag that much, it also has no overheating issues. Overall solid phone for this price range.; Great value for money. Its only downside are its camera and battery. The camera is of decent quality and the battery backup is pretty average, while playing games it drains rather quickly than the competition. There is also a slight heating issue.; Excellent phone in this price range. 120hz Amoled display is great. Camera quality is also good. Indisplay fingerprint scanner is also working fine. No issues at all. This smartphone has one of the most powerful processor in this price range. Overall performance of this mobile is excellent. Even for gaming this smartphone is very good. I am very satisfied.; Except camera, every thing is worth.; Nice display and performance....good interface option for different users."
