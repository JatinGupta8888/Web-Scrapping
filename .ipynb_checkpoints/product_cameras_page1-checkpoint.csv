Produces good colors; Print quality is very good with photos taken from mobile..but camer inbuilt camera is not that good; Rather than looking at it as a camera printer, consider it a printer camera. Because you may not be using the camera as often due to inherent limitations of instant cameras.; The product stopped working in 2 months; I was confused between Kodak and Fujifilm but ended up taking this and am very satisfied. My reasons for purchase were:
1. Brand image
2. Amazing process of printing
3. Best option in this price range
4. Lower cost of film roll compared to Fujifilm; I bought it for my anniversary picture and I am very happy with the product.The ease of access and the print quality is good.Only thing which can be improved is Kodak can give a larger screen and it becomes difficult to guess the exact background.
Pros-Photo filter for variation in photography,Can be paired with mobile and act as a printer,laminated insta pictures for better longer life
Cons-LCD screen size and quality can be improved,Little bit heavy
My verdict-One of the best insta camera.; Picture quality is not that great. Better with mobile photos. Easy & fun to use.; I actually buy this camera due to good review about picture quality but in actual print quality of photo very bad not as expected. Genuinely I feel like it's a waste of money...; Ótimo produto; During the year of use, I took 40 photos, some of them were spoiled by the camera, but in general, it is a very wonderful thing that will bring you a lot of good emotions.; Me agrada que no solo cumple con tomar fotos sino como una impresora de ellas, y de muy buena calidad.
La autonomía de la batería queda un poco corta pero sigue siendo un gran producto, solo tengan cuidado cuando inserten los cartuchos ya que se puede arruinar el mismo.; I rarely write reviews, but upon purchasing and using this product and seeing the onslaught of negative reviews, I had to sit down and type one out.

First, I do not understand the negative reviews. Maybe some critical thinking skills aren't being applied when others have bought this product. You see lots of ""My iPhone/Android camera takes better quality pictures!"" in the complaints. Let's dissect this. Most smartphones nowadays retail for nearly $1,000 in total, and a key element in their advertising is not only the quality of the built in cameras but the constant improves from model to model. Of course, a smart phone camera is going to produce better quality pictures. It's one of the reasons we spend our hard earned money on them. If all we needed was a device to call and text, we'd still be using flip phones. Let's put our thinking caps on and remember why the little computers in our pockets can take excellent if not astounding quality pictures - because they're built to!

Now, this Kodak camera does state it prints ""superior photo"" quality, but it does not boast ""state of the art"" quality or even ""smart phone"" quality, because it knows its place and that would be a flat out lie. Read the fine print, people! Superior does not automatically equate to breathtaking, especially when you look at the product itself. Once again, this is a basic camera/tool. It is not built to be an equal to a smartphone which is essentially, as I said, a mini-computer; It is not built to be an equal to even the lowest tier of professional photography cameras. It IS however, built to be a simple, basic photo taking device that you can also connect to your phone, iPad or other supported device if you choose to.

It does what it says on the box, so I am happy with this purchase. I suspect other customers were expecting something far more complex and souped up, and that is not what this camera is.

Now, the only cons I have for it is that printing process is a little slow, but it takes less than a minute. The paper quality is good though, so I'll let this slide. You can't have everything, especially if you're buying something that is quite budget when it comes to bells and whistles. And that's another thing I'd like to mention - this prints on modern day photo paper. Do not expect the thick, flimsy paper that actual polaroid cameras printed on. If that's what you're after, then you'll be better off heading over to eBay or a pawn shop.

This is a modern take on an old school favorite. Understand what you're buying, and you will be a satisfied customer.; La calidad de las fotos es muy buena y el tamaño es suficientemente grande, a diferencia de otras cámaras instantaneas que te imprimen como mucho tamaño similar al de una foto de carnet. Las funciones que tiene son bastante básicas, pero si lo que buscas es la simplicidad y facilidad de uso de las cámaras instantaneas retro no te hara falta más. Las impresiones son económicas y de buena calidad. Alternativamente con la App de Kodak en el móvil puedes imprimir fotos de la cámara del móvil con todos los filtros y retoques necesarios como si fuese una impresora bluetooth. Ante un apuro también sirve para imprimir un par de fotos de carnet por impresión, eso sí, tendrás que ver que salgan a la escala correcta para que coincidan con el tamaño carnet. No tiene memoria, únicamente puedes imprimir o descartar la foto, para eso mejor usar el móvil y usarla como impresora. A los niños les encanta por ser sencilla de usar y poder ver la foto impresa físicamente. Resulta recomendable comprarle una funda para llevar la cámara y algún recambio de fotos."

Will be posting my snaps in coming weeks as I am experimenting with the different effects.

A Must Buy for the Creative Heads out there!; Used Fujifilm instant camera for the first time and I was amazed with its color saturation and it’s smoothly printing photos without any delay. Must buy product!; ""Absolutely love my Instax Mini 99! The vintage vibe and instant gratification of printed photos make every moment memorable. Easy to use, great quality prints, and perfect for capturing life's spontaneous joys. Highly recommend!""; The newly launched mini 99 by Fujifilm is amazing to use. The picture clarity and overall performance is value for money.
Capture moments in different color and frame.; Ich habe die INSTAX mini 99 jetzt circa zwei Monate ausgiebig getestet und was soll man sagen - Ich bin total begeistert!
Bei vielen anderen Sofortbildkameras geht es nur um die Momentaufnahme - bei der mini 99 jedoch gibt es viele kleine Feinheiten, die beim Fotografieren richtig Spaß machen.
Sie ist optisch ein richtiger Blickfang und fühlt sich dazu auch sehr hochwertig an. Durch die verschiedenen Einstellräder oder das verstellbare Objektiv hat man ein richtiges analoges Bediengefühl.
Ich bin ein großer Fan von den Farbeffekten. Hiermit sieht jedes Sofortbild nach etwas besonderem aus, egal wie einfach das Motiv war.
Von der Qualität der Bilder bin ich ebenfalls sehr begeistert.
Diese Sofortbildkamera ist wirklich für jeden geeignet. Fotografen, die ein wenig mit Funkionen, wie Langzeitbelichtung oder Doppelbelichtung, spielen möchten, aber auch für ""Anfänger"", da die Standardeinstellungen schon tolle Bilder liefern!; J'adore la photo et j'ai globalement suivi l'évolution du marché depuis le milieu des années 90 : les appareils argentiques jetables de mon enfance, les compacts numériques, une montée en gamme en passant au bridge puis au reflex, sans compter les smartphones toujours plus performants. Résultat : des milliers, peut-être des dizaines de milliers de photos qui dorment dans des disques durs, des clés usb... et que je ne regarde jamais ou presque.

L'instax, malgré son aspect plastique cheap en main, malgré ses caractéristiques médiocres sur le papier (un 60 mm f/12,7) procure le plaisir unique de l'instantané et de la photo qui se dessine peu à peu sous vos yeux. Elle devient tout de suite un objet tangible qui crée du lien, et même une émotion liée à son imperfection (à la manière d'un vinyle). Car le but n'est pas d'égaler la précision des appareils numériques mais de créer des photos plus authentiques, dans un style très vintage. Les maniaques du piqué, passez votre chemin : oui il y aura du flou, de la surexposition, des photos complètement loupées... mais c'est aussi le jeu. Et ce doit être compliqué pour quelqu'un qui n'a jamais connu l'argentique. Il faut vraiment gérer la lumière et ne pas chercher des compositions trop compliquées avec de trop fortes dynamiques : c'est voué à l'échec. Mais on apprend et si on se fait avoir au début, on sort ensuite des clichés plus satisfaisants avec beaucoup de charme.

De plus, l'instax mini 99 constitue une évolution par rapport aux autres modèles et propose un peu plus de contrôle sur les photos : les filtres de couleur, le réglage de la luminosité, le vignetage, 3 niveaux de mise au point, le contrôle du flash, plusieurs modes (intérieur, sport, double exposition, bulb). Cela décuple les possibilités créatives !

Bref, oubliez la technique trop compliquée, oubliez les smartphones qui corrigent trop et profitez d'un appareil à mi-chemin entre la tradition et la modernité qui vous redonnera le sourire.; Vraiment un immense plaisir à utiliser !; it is easy to use，vantage style. but It doesn't look as good as the Mini 90. The improvement over the Mini 90 is not significant, and the price might be a bit high. Personally, I think a reasonable price for this machine would be around $150.; The newest of Fuji's Instax range the 99 is a big bulky camera that uses the standard Instax film (it doesn't come with any film so I bought a pack for use with the camera). As with other Instax cameras it doesn't offer the option to print borderless unlike the Kodak Mini Shot range. It features macro & landscape capabilities (accessed by turning the lens) as well light/darkness compensation. I didn't use the camera with the App as I feel the camera should be able to do what I want in camera. The advertising tends to emphasise the novelty features (colour effects, vignetting etc) .
Having tried it on macro I found that when using flash it would focus past the subject. Without flash it struggled with image definition and tended to wash out details.
When taking shots outside (see attached photograph) it struggled with definition and contrast. The first of the three photos was taken on ""N"" and then using the light/darkness compensation dial for the last two. The shots are either too bright or too dark (the sun was behind and to the side).
Overall picture quality is variable (out of twenty shots there wasn't one that was particularly good), the camera build is plastic and bulky and I feel is overpriced."

Sie sollte für zufällige Fotos unterwegs immer dabei sein und das Gefummel mit dem Handy ablösen. Für kleine Familienfeiern oder um mal schnell ein Dokument oder ein paar Pflänzchen im Garten abfotografieren ist sie auch sehr gut zu verwenden. Die Bilder sind von guter Qualität, der Blitz stark genug und die Kamera ist leicht zu bedienen. Für Fotos unter extremen Bedingungen, aus sehr großen Entfernungen und für astronomische Aufnahmen ist die kleine Kodak natürlich ungeeignet, dafür habe ich eine Nikon Coolpix P1000. Die ist aber entsprechend schwer, groß und unhandlich. Außerdem hat sie fast das Zehnfache gekostet. Die möchte ich im Schwimmbad oder am Strand nicht unbedingt unbeobachtet liegen lassen. Deshalb habe ich mir die kleine Kodak als Zweitkamera gekauft. Und schon nach einer Woche ist sie mir lieb und teuer geworden, ich möchte sie nicht mehr missen. Als sehr angenehm empfinde ich auch, dass sie mit normalen R6-Batterien funktioniert, die man schnell mal irgendwo kaufen kann, so erspart man sich lange Akku-Ladezeiten. Aber mit Akkus funktioniert sie natürlich auch. Also, ich bin sehr zufrieden und hab die Kleine jetzt immer dabei. :); Simple et léger, ma fille est ravie de son cadeau !; Estaba buscando una cámara pequeña para poder llevar siempre conmigo, que tuviese buena calidad pero que a la vez sacase fotos tipo analógicas y retro.

Sí que es verdad que no siempre la saca con ese toque retro, pero muchas de ellas utilizando el flash, sí.

Esta cámara consigue todo lo que quería y con mejor calidad de la que esperaba. Es un 10/10, me encanta :)"

So far the only thing I really don’t like is you have to delete pictures/videos 1 by 1 or fully delete everything. You can’t scroll through and select a bunch of pics like I’m accustomed to.

It comes with 2 batteries (which is great to have an extra), a 32GB memory card and a charging cord. The battery and memory card both fit into the same compartment. The plastic door is a bit flimsy, so hoping it holds up ok. I’m not very tech savvy, so not sure yet how to transfer the pictures from the camera to my phone or laptop. There’s no case, but you’ll want one to protect the front digital lens. It’s not waterproof or water resistant. There is metal threading to mount it on a tripod if you have one, to help hold it still.

In general, this is a beginner camera as advertised, and best suited for kids in my opinion.; I got this camera for my young daughter, who is interested in starting out in photography. The box specifically states that this camera is for beginners and it lives up to that role perfectly. It's effortless to use with a simple learning curve, allowing her to start taking pictures right away. This cute little point-and-shoot camera comes with a 32GB card and a wrist strap, making it a fantastic starter kit. Most starter kits don't include the memory card, so this is a big plus. It's lightweight, fits well in the hand, and is portable enough to take anywhere. It would make an excellent gift and is just a fun, easy-to-use camera. The picture quality isn’t DSLR but definitely good enough to print.; it had very bad quality photo taking the battery was really bad and i would not buy this if i were you it is a cheap and stupid thing to buy save your money and buy a better cameras.; I got this to throw in my purse while out with friends and it does a good job of quick snap shots. It's light weight and small which i like. It's not the highest quality out there but for the price you can't go wrong. The images are suitable enough for posting on socials but i wouldn't print them out. I haven't played too much with video because i don't usually take videos. They give you an SD card and 2 batteries which i think is great too."

The only thing applaudable is how this camera manages to be even worse than my decade old nokia.

I would highly suggest you to refrain from buying this camera. No refund is provided and my money has been wasted.; Poor picture quality. Plastic body, poorly built. I would have returned if that was possible. To make the experience poorer, the seller took very long time to deliver ( 3 weeks) after registering a complaint.; I love this camera, the quality is amazing and even better when it’s uploaded. It’s really easy to use, and having it with you makes everything so much more fun!!; Just got this and it's awesome! The 1080P video is super clear, and the 44MP pics are really detailed. Love that it comes with two batteries, so no worries about running out of juice. The 16X zoom is a plus, letting you capture stuff from far away without any fuzziness.

It's easy to use and perfect for anyone new to photography or for kids to play around with. The lanyard and anti-shake feature make it even better. It's light, easy to carry, and the extra 32GB card is a great bonus. Totally recommend it! Five stars from me!; I was really impressed by this camera considering the price. The images were smooth, but the downside is that they’re only smooth on normal zoom. When you zoom in, it gets pretty pixelated. It offers a lot of different filtering options and is super easy to use.
The battery life only lasts roughly an hour and a half, so it’s great for short outings but likely not ideal for a day trip.; Had the camera for about a year. The battery life is great and the pictures are great. Obviously if you're wanting to take more professional and detailed photos, the images may be too low quality. However, the screen has frozen on multiple occasions and won't respond to any buttons thay are pressed including not powering off. It seems to come out of it but it can take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a few hours. Besides that, it's a pretty good camera.; When my daughter asked for a digital camera, I had flashbacks to my own days of lugging a camera around, documenting every moment like a 2000s-era influencer. This camera is incredibly lightweight, comes with two batteries and a memory card, making it an absolute steal.

The camera's compact size makes it incredibly convenient for travel and on-the-go shooting, while the image quality is nothing short of outstanding.

The fast and accurate autofocus system is a true standout feature. It locks onto subjects with remarkable precision, ensuring I never miss a moment. Whether I'm capturing stunning landscapes or fast-moving subjects, the Sony Alpha 6100 delivers impressive results.

The flip-up touchscreen is a huge bonus for vloggers and selfie enthusiasts. It's incredibly user-friendly, and the intuitive menu system makes adjusting settings a breeze. The 4K video quality is outstanding, providing crisp and detailed footage.

Battery life has been better than expected, allowing me to shoot for extended periods without constantly worrying about recharging. The low-light performance is also commendable, producing clear and noise-free images even in challenging conditions.

In summary, the Sony Alpha 6100 is a versatile and high-performance mirrorless camera that suits both beginners and experienced photographers alike. Its compact design, superb autofocus, and excellent image quality make it a wise investment for capturing memories with precision and style. I couldn't be happier with my purchase!; After a month with this camera, I've found it to be reasonably priced compared to other mirrorless options from other brands. However, it falls short of my expectations in terms of photo quality. Coming from a Nikon DSLR background, I noticed a dullness in color reproduction, necessitating post-processing to enhance vibrancy. The 16-50 mm lens yields results similar to mobile photography, while the 55-210 mm offers a broader frame range. Despite the photographic drawbacks, this camera shines for vlogging and content creation, boasting satisfying video quality and useful features like slow-motion capability. If your focus is primarily on video work, this could be a worthy investment.

Photos I’ve uploaded are taken in 55-210 mm lens and edited in photoshop application.; Switched from Nikon D3400 to Sony Alpha a6100. Loved this! Bought the dual lens combo with kit lens 16-50mm and 55-210mm telephoto.

The camera feels nice to hold, light but feels dense. Telephoto lens is a master at high ranges. Kit lens is great for wide shots.

Recieved in box:
64GB Sony SDHC card class 10, camera bag, lens cap, lens hood, charger, battery, USB type B cable, shoulder strap, viewfinder cup.

Note: The camera bag is very basic and cheaper quality.

All in all, a very nice camera. Fast autofocus, versatile and lenses have optical stabilization.; Its compact design makes it easy to carry around, while the 24.2MP sensor delivers sharp and detailed photos. The inclusion of two lenses in the kit (16-50mm and 55-210mm) provides a wide range of focal lengths for various shooting scenarios. The autofocus system is fast and accurate, making it suitable for both beginners and enthusiasts.
Package was great and intact. Camera carrying bag is decent enough to protect and carry along with the supplied accessories. Excellent Choice!; I was torn between the Sony alpha 6100, 6400 and Canon Eos R7 but then decided to go with the 6100 and save some money. The camera and kit lenses are really good. Sony’s user interface isn’t the most intuitive but once it was set up, I didn’t have to go back and forth too much. All in all, an excellent purchase.; Sometime it process slow but if you have lol bit patience it will give you the extreme satisfaction with the high quality picture. Just go for it as it’s a perfect DSLR for beginners.; Good camera sony a6100; "

Good for beginners, just go for it.; Amazon
Let me start with the experience with Amazon. Currently, it is hard to get this camera, and I appreciate Amazon for providing this good camera. At the same time, the availability is highly inconsistent. Sometimes it will be available, then it won't be available, and it comes again. Pricing also varies in the same manner. I bought it for 65k, and after a few days, it dropped to 61k (including a 16-50mm kit lens). So, it is not a great buying experience.
The delivery was okayish. It came in a big package, reducing all impacts. The handling of the camera didn't seem that delicate. It was an okayish experience.

My requirements
Even though it is a vlogging camera, I didn't buy it for vlogging. I wanted a mirrorless camera with an APS-C sensor and great 4k video recording (good autofocus, less crop, good stabilization).

Build quality
Coming to the camera, it is a good camera for the price you pay. Build quality is good and doesn't feel cheap at all. If you compare it with other premium cameras having weather sealing, it may feel a bit short of quality. It cuts corners in weather sealing, EVF, the shoot mode button, and flash. The lack of EVF can be a deal breaker for many photographers, but we can get used to the display soon. The shoot dial can be assigned to a button to compensate. Flash is rarely used, and it might not be a big deal for most. Flip out screen is a good option for recording videos.

Image Quality is good, as it comes with an APS-C sensor. The kit lens is good enough for taking decent-quality photos. But, to get better results (sharper pics, lowlight performance, etc.), it is good to switch to other lenses. Sony's 50mm prime lens (20k) and Sigma 18-50 mm are some great lenses.

Video
Video quality is another area in which it excels. It shoots 4k without crop if you turn off the video stabilization and stabilize in catalyst browse. The sharpness, color, and autofocus are blended beautifully in this camera. If you go for Canon M50, you won't get good autofocus in 4k. To have that, you must go for M6 II, which costs around 80k!

Additional options for connectivity to the phone, earphone port, mic port, USB streaming, customizing, and light form factor are also good additions. The battery is decent, but I would recommend buying one extra.

If you want a good APS-C camera with good 4K video shooting, this is the best option you can get for this money. Obviously you have to bear with the cost cutting in EVF, flash, weather sealing, and shoot mode dial.; This is the best beginner camera for videographers and aspiring cinematographers even in 2023!

The small size gives you the liberty to carry this around without getting too much attention.

The battery life is perfect for my needs but I can't really compare since I haven't tried other cameras.

The picture quality is fantastic with sony's signature colour science. You can also shoot in s-log2 or HLG and then grade it to your taste in post.

The kit lens won't give you the best bokeh or the fastest shutter speeds but it is a great lens to start with. The image I attached was clicked with a third party manual lens with f/1.2. The limitations of the kit lens will make you better at lighting and composition. Best beginner lens I would say.

The camera isn't water and moisture resistant so I couldn't test it much during this rainy season. Excited to see what I can get out of this small little beast!; If u r a beginner and want to have a light weight compact camera which has all the earstwhile good dslr capability ..i think this is the one. With its shooting and video mode easy to handle I think it's one of the best camera available today. The kit lens is a great lens indeed. You can shoot awsome pictures from it.; Thik hai par 4k mein 25 hai sirf; ; Absolutely worth the hype for this camera in the video category. The autofocus is crazy fast and accurate.
Pictures come out with decent quality and color accuracy, which is enough combination.
YouTube, Vlog be it indoors or our home youtube studio on a budget this will add so much value to your content.; Actually, for this price range, this camera is too good. It was marketed as a vlogging camera but had much more potential. This camera would be almost good but it's rolling shutter. yes, I knew it had very bad stabilisation and rolling shutter but it is too bad. bad mean, I would prefer shooting with my phone camera rather than this camera. you can not use any handheld video with this camera. Catalyst browser can fix it but the process is very time-consuming. it will frustrate you at some point."

Really angry. What a waste of money. I have spent a small fortune on the cameras and film, never again!; ; I got two of these as gifts. One came w me on a trip so I got to watch it first hand.

Flash is always on so don't try taking photos through a closed window - you'll get all white.

It's not great for distance as it get quite blurry - like you're not wearing your glasses; you recognize the image but details are limited (e.g. >10metres or 30ft).
Film is expensive so I'm not sure if any more was purchased separately.; I think this camera is a great little bang for your buck. It is easy to use and helps create perfect nostalgic photos. I wish it printed on the standard size polaroid film, but there is something charming about the smaller sized photos, so it's no big deal to me.
I recommend to anyone who is looking for a quick, fun and easy little polaroid-esque camera!"

Value for money; Showing IZI new One+ in product description but have received IZI one normal one which is available at Amazon in rs. 1000/- less price.

The camera is not gud at all. Only good thing about this camera is accessories that we get with it, else everything is pooor. The main thing for which one buys an action camera is stabilization, which is worst in this camera.....dynamic range sucks ......a one minute video in 4k 60 fps takes 1 gb of storage which is too much as compared to the quality it delivers. I mean1 gb space for a video of 1 minute that too in poorest quality is way too much. Highly highly disappointed by this product. 5 hazaar or add karke DJI action 2 lena sahi hai. Iska wide angle ekdum bekaaar ....kora bakwaaas wide angle. Video clarity ghatiyaaa.....self vlogging jisme aap khud ko jada dikhate ho uske liye ye cam thoda theek hai....baaki motovlog, carvlog, action vlog ke liye isse bekaar koi product nahi ho sakta ....do not waste ur money.

Getting used to it
It’s satisfying my requirements; I was looking to replace my 12 year old cannon 550D. I have been cannon shooter past 20years and it was tough to ditch canon. I developed interest in bird photography past 2 years and was looking for a fast autofocus camera with high ISO.After lotnof research found D7500 perfectly fits into my requirement. It's been over a week and my experience sonfar has been great, low light high ISO performance is great and autofocus is sharp and accurate. I recommend this camera who is looking for an upgrade from a beginner DSLR.; Everything that is legendary ends up being Nikon. 4k video, 20 mp stills, affordable price, very little left to desire. Expected the arrived package to be In better wrapping for an item this expensive.; Damage and diftive; Picture quality is very good, I have done model shoot on the day when it arrives to me and I'm totally satisfied with the camera.; HIGHLY RECOMMENDED; After 40 years as a Pentax user I finally had to give up after two K70 cameras failed due to bad AF solenoids. Have used Nikon binoculars for many years so I migrated to Nikon and chose the D7500 with an 18-140mm lens. Still getting used to the camera, it has a different ‘feel’ after the Pentax, but I’m impressed with the picture quality. The lens is certainly heavier than I’ve been used to, but so far the auto focus has worked flawlessly, resulting in a sharpness to the pictures that has been difficult to capture in the past. Despite taking photos and videos for over 60 years, the myriad of settings is intimidating, but the ‘point and shoot’ option will probably suffice in most instances.; Produto original de ótima y, recomendo; Super appareil photo semi-professionnel.
Un bon début pr les profils intermédiaires qui souhaitent faire un peu plus de photos autrement qu'en mode automatique.; Girlfriend is more than happy to have a nice camera in her hands. So handy that all photos can be directly transfered to your mobile phone.; Great camera with loads of different function, better than previous camera..
Very enjoyable to use the different photo taking options.... :-)"

For the first time in 10 years saw such a worst experience from both Amazon customer care and the seller. And the funny part is, manufacturer sent a defective product to me and asking me to visit the branch office.

Just press the button and film will pop up with quality photos. Good for her to start collecting memories of her childhood years; It got water on it and was left for a while apparently. Did absolutely fine afterwards. The film was a bit damaged but the camera itself works great still. Batteries lasted about 7 months before needing replaced. Theres a case you can buy with a strap, I suggest that if your girlfriend likes to take it on dates. Definitely worth the cost. My girlfriend loved it. She loved that it was a light purple too."

Wonderful how they pack such an advance technology in a small pack. This is the magic of mirrorless technology from SONY.Dynamite in small size. It incorporate such advance camera technologies that beats bigger dsIrs easily. Especially the eye auto focus is blazingly fast. At this price it beats even double priced DSLR of other brands.
Pictures are razor sharp with nice pleasing color. Very easy to carry as small lightweight. Excellent buy in sale. IF you are planning to buy a enthusiastic camera which gives professional quality results this camera should be high on your priority. This review comes from a freelance photojournalist who owns many DSLR and mirrorless from many brands. Honest review; Next day delivery, it was amazing. And in addition to this I got 64 GB sony Memory card and small Sony camera bag (quality is ok).- even the description doesn't show these extra items but i found these items inside.

Writing this review after using 5 days- the camera feels so amazing. Now I'm glad that I got this camera. And turned to Sony user.

Likes
1. Amazing Autofocus- Thats the primary reason to choose this camera.
2. Reasonable Low light performance upto 6400 ISO
3. Kit lens zoom is amazingly smooth.
4. 4K video with 30fps- great deal
5. 100 fps slow motion
6. Compact.
7. Best camera for Short movies.
8. Battery can be charged while using- (great deal)

Dislikes:
1. Handling -Handle grip is not good enough to hold the camera confidently.
2. Sony menu system.- I was canon user, new to sony menu system so struggling, but more we get used the more we can do well with this.; First of all "" it's discount on Amazon is awesome. Like we saved 7.5k off msrp with one lens and body. That's awesome. As I used dslr, but when I started to use this , the compact camera , lightweight and the clarity. Omg . It's so good. And portability is like another level. As a beginner in photograph .. I strongly recommend anyone to get this instead of a dslr. For more info Google about ILCE VS DSLR and find it out yourself. Buy this over alpha 6000. Because a6000 is old and lacks lots and lots of feature. I mean it is also a really good camera no doubt. It's the most sold sony APS-C on the planet, But this A6100 also competes with even intermediate and advanced cameras. To put a small list of features
: tiltable LCD 3"" Screen
EVF SUPER clarity.
Easy to use Wi-Fi to connect , when compared with other companies
Focus 0.06 sec (unbelievable)
11fps shoots
Plus sony also has it's class of lens. Check their catalogue , well they are a bit costly. But this body is made like a TANK , future proof, you can change any amount of E MOUNT lens in the future.
Customisable menu as well as buttons.( do you even find this in other camera )

You will be so much satisfied when you buy this. There is also an a6400 or a6600 but. This is really good enough for beginner and even intermediate photographers.

Put that extra 10 or 15 k and buy this please. I know mirrorless are expensive. But this is worth that every extra penny.; <<<I will continue to update this thread>>>
Just now bought and tried video and photos,
Auto Mode just takes care of everything.
Video quality is more than enough to shoot a short film if you have a proper lighting sense.; Sony is best in it's segment when it comes to buy a DSLR which is flexible to use, I'm saying here flexible because you can use any of the sony lenses available in the market (even if it's a full frame camera lens). I'm using this camera as a professional photographer and personal uses as well. Here are some topics to consider while buying sony alpha 6100
Cons are :
1. Autofocus is absolutely amazing and faster than any dslr camera in the world.
2. Easy to carry and quite handy for everyday uses.
3. Battery life is niether top notch nor average, you can expect 300 to 400 shots (depending upon several factors) easly in one charge.
4. True to life colors in every image, I'm posting here two images taken by sony alpha 6100 without any editing.
5. Last but not the least, if someone is buying it for your personal use and your top priority is to take astonising and great detailed pictures then without any doubt this one is going to mate your every defination of ""good camera"".

Even cons are neglegible to talk about it but yet I'll discuss it -
1. If your hands are too big (as mine) then in the starting you need to take extra care of it because of it's slim and small design, after few days you'll get habitual to it 👍
2. No fully touch screen (if it matters to you) is sometimes disappointing as, most of the cameras in this price segment, already having fully touch screen.
3. Missing some modern features (if someone looking for feature loaded camera and can compromise in picture quality).
4. Consider that you can't use this camera outdoors in rainy weather as it may cause moisture retantion.

Well, as I said if someone looking for a dslr which full fills it's real use (photo and video graphy) then none of those cameras out there can beat this master (of course you're skill matters). Don't get biased by any oftge brand names, do proper research, understand your requirements and then make the decision."

The camera itself is compact and light, easy for a child to put in their fanny pack when traveling or out with friends.
It has an easy-to-use interface and is intuitive enough for a novice.
While the photos are of good quality, you will obviously not match the megapixels and 4K quality offered by the latest smartphones. This is, of course, not a concern for a 12-year-old!
It does require an SD card, which was a novel concept for my kid, lol!
All in all, highly recommended for those young budding photographers!; Ok; MALO. Los vídeos no graban sonido. Las fotos de super baja calidad. Simplemente al tocar el producto se siente barato.

I previously bought a camera (Kodak 26X still works fine) like this about 15 years ago and now with a better zoom and technology I decided to buy the newest version. This zoom is so nice. We live were there are birds and wildlife and love being able to get some nice photos without breaking out the big camera changing lenses and then putting it all away when done. Easy to carry around. Light weight. Overall a great camera for the money. Lots of photo options for different scenarios.
Cons: Doesn't have the second button for vertical photo. The lens cap isn't secured in place with a click like my old camera. Therefor the lens cap comes off quite easily so be sure to use the string attachment so you don't lose it.; Gostei muito das funvções de controle de registro de imagens, muitas opções. Necessário adquirir uma bolsa de transporte.; Que esperas de una cámara con ese precio? Pues tienes que esperar algo básico .
Claro que con tu iPhone 14 Pro Max harás mejores fotos pero en mi caso la adquirí porque al irme de viaje prefiero no estar gastando la batería de mi móvil para el GPS .
Hace las fotos bastante bien
Para larga distancia es mejor con un trípode queda más nítida .
Va con 4 pilas AA que te servirá para hacer unas 200 fotos incluidas en la caja .
No viene con estuche ni tarjeta sd .
Es compacta pero robusta se siente de calidad.
No tiene wifi viene con cable usb de transmisión de datos .
Resumen relación calidad precio está muy bien ahora si eres tiquismiquis pues gástate 600 € en una canon eos o 2000€ en una profesional 😂"

I have Nikon D500 and also had Nikon Coolpix P900. I sold my P900 and bought Nikon Coolpix P950.

Nikon Coolpix P950 has borrowed lot of things from P1000. Like 4K video in 30fps, 1080p in 60fps, And supports Raw format in Images. The EVF is better than P900 and also the Zoom buttom has been smoother compaired to P900. The auto focus si also better when compaire to P900 and the tracking system is lot more better this time.

The 4K video quality is awesome. You can view the sample video in my youtube channel "" Jakati's Photography Travel & Wildlife.

The picture quality is also awesome , even though it has a smaller sensor with 16MP the images are good and sharp. The insane 2000mm zoom is sufficent to view moon's creaters. The camera is very light in weight compare to P1000 and also very handy.; First I thought go & buy from shop but Amazon did greate deal as I experience geniality as I got it completely seal product with free kit from dealer who's deliver to me overall nice experience . Turn to camera as it's built for wild photography as I am one of them hence bye it it's give me greater results if you have that much budget go for it; Excellent camera with excellent zoom. I also have Nikon DSLR, but to get this type of Zoom on DSLR you will need 2000mm lense which will be very expensive.; According to my usage and understanding, it is a four-star camera. One simple reason is that it is a daylight camera. Low light, with this machine, really limits your possibilities. But when it comes to (zoom) range, you can explore it quite a bit. For telephotography, it is a pretty decent tool. Color science is good and you can adjust it as per your taste. Macro photography is another cool feature. This camera can help you capture moments that otherwise are possible with only high-end cameras. if you are into videography, you can do that as well. This camera provides good video output but using an external audio output device is recommended as noise cancellation is not that brilliant but it will do the job. To conclude, a good camera to have. (Attached are few samples taken by this camera); Happy with all the features and build quality. but don't see a real reason why it should be so expensive over its predecessor p900. Modern tech is there but still doesn't justify such as high price. Chose this over p1000 as this is much smaller in size and easy in handling. p1000 is quite bulky and huge to hold and shoot comfortably in comparison to p950. Image stabilization I sensed works in an overdrive at times. Like the larger display as compared to p900. Picture quality - given the zoom levels don't expect extremely good quality pics at high zoom, the idea of zoom is just bring object more closure. If you want a great picture quality pics at high zooms, DSLRs with expensive telephoto lens is the way to go. At this price and given its newer launch compared to p900, very disappointed to see it still has the old USB port for charging. USB-C is the way to go for all modern gadgets.; Why not 16 Mega pixals is improved over predecessors though cost incresed very high seems not justified require improment .; Nice huge zoom.
All in one no hassels photography for amateur photographers. Excellent for birding.; Price is too high in India. But the camera is a better choice who opt for bridge cameras. Haven't used an external flash yet. Don't know whether it will support or not.; Had a P900 for 7 years and a P520 before that. The P950 has some key great features over the P900, raw mode, hot shoe, 4K video. The optics and picture quality are just as good. Took it up to Vermont for the solar eclipse in April, my photos were as good as anything other amateurs posted on the net. Its still compact enough to easily carry it in hand or on a neck strap. The 24-2000mm equivalent zoom eliminates the need to carry around a camera back with 2-3 extra lenses.; Produto top de linha; Ive had several cameras in this series including the P900 and the p1000..I lam a birder and I love them for their zoom capacity and the crisp details you are able to capture..I don't like the fact that you can't get good flight shots and sometimes it takes a while to get your lens focused and the bird has moved but overall, I keep coming back to these cameras because of the zoom and quality of the image..I’m not as happy with the clarity of the P950 and would not buy this camera again..am wondering if something g is wrong with my camera or whether the clarity is just not as good with this model..I also find I miss a lot of shots while this camera is trying to focus..Would like to know if there is a warranty with this camera..; Tiene buen zoom, fácil de usar; In daylight not pointed to the sun, this camera can really see things far away. You can use the HDMI to look at things far away on a monitor, though the HDMI output as far as I can tell is not the highest quality.
The stills are like looking through a large binocular, but much easier to hold. There really is not much wuth this long of a telephoto available.
If you want a super telephoto this is the one to get. Forget the Sony and Panasonic cameras for long range zoom, they can't match this Nikon"

Very happy with the zoom feature.; Pros: I have used many different cameras over the years. I previously bought a camera (Kodak 26X still works fine) like this about 15 years ago and now with a better zoom and technology I decided to buy the newest version. This zoom is so nice. We live were there are birds and wildlife and love being able to get some nice photos without breaking out the big camera changing lenses and then putting it all away when done. Easy to carry around. Light weight. Overall a great camera for the money. Lots of photo options for different scenarios.
Cons: Doesn't have the second button for vertical photo. The lens cap isn't secured in place with a click like my old camera. Therefor the lens cap comes off quite easily so be sure to use the string attachment so you don't lose it.; Gostei muito das funvções de controle de registro de imagens, muitas opções. Necessário adquirir uma bolsa de transporte.; Que esperas de una cámara con ese precio? Pues tienes que esperar algo básico .
Claro que con tu iPhone 14 Pro Max harás mejores fotos pero en mi caso la adquirí porque al irme de viaje prefiero no estar gastando la batería de mi móvil para el GPS .
Hace las fotos bastante bien
Para larga distancia es mejor con un trípode queda más nítida .
Va con 4 pilas AA que te servirá para hacer unas 200 fotos incluidas en la caja .
No viene con estuche ni tarjeta sd .
Es compacta pero robusta se siente de calidad.
No tiene wifi viene con cable usb de transmisión de datos .
Resumen relación calidad precio está muy bien ahora si eres tiquismiquis pues gástate 600 € en una canon eos o 2000€ en una profesional 😂"

With its 12MP camera and 4K video recording at 30fps, it captures crisp, vibrant footage. The rugged, waterproof design allows for underwater use up to 30 meters, making it perfect for diving and snorkeling.

Its wide-angle lens offers a 170-degree field of view, and various shooting modes, including time-lapse and slow motion, add versatility. The Wi-Fi connectivity and intuitive mobile app simplify file transfers and remote control.

Despite average low-light performance and modest battery life, the FitSpark Action Camera delivers excellent value with its durable build and comprehensive features. It's a solid choice for anyone looking to capture high-quality adventures without a hefty price tag.; Here's a breakdown of its features I liked the most
1. Perfect for Vlogging: Dual touch screens - a 1.4"""" front one for framing your shots and a 2"""" rear one for playback - make it easy to control the camera, ideal for vloggers like me who need to see themselves while recording.
2. Sharp 4K Recording: Capture crisp footage in up to 4K resolution at 30fps, ensuring high-quality videos
3. Built to Last: The EAGLE i15 PRO MAX boasts a durable build that feels solid in your hands, ready to withstand the rigors of your adventures.
4. Beyond the Basics: Expand your creative options with features like slow-motion recording, time-lapse for capturing long events in short clips, and various photo modes.
5. Seamless Sharing: Built-in Wi-Fi lets you effortlessly transfer footage to your smartphone or tablet for quick sharing on the go.

Overall, the EAGLE i15 PRO MAX is a versatile action camera with features that cater to both adventure enthusiasts and vloggers.""; ; Sure, it shoots smooth 4K footage and boasts a durable build, but where it truly shines is its advanced time lapse features. Imagine condensing hours of exploration into a captivating minute-long video. With the i15 Pro Max's time lapse, you can do just that. Go beyond basic interval shooting. This camera offers a variety of customizable options, letting you capture the essence of a sunrise, the bustling energy of a city street, or the slow transformation of a landscape – all with stunning clarity.; The Eagle i15 action camera caters to adrenaline enthusiasts and content creators like me seeking to capture their adventures with high-quality visuals and, more importantly, superior audio. I always want clear audio for my videos which I got with this.
Strength in Sound:
The Eagle i15 stands out for its Type-C external microphone support. This allows you to connect a compatible external mic, vastly improving audio quality compared to built-in mic. This is a game-changer for vloggers, YouTubers, and anyone recording in windy or noisy environments. Imagine capturing clear commentary while biking, or crisp dialogue during interviews – the external microphone support makes the Eagle i15 a strong contender for action audio. However the microphone is not in the camera box & needs to be purchased separately, but buying the ext mic is worth it ! While audio is a highlight, the Eagle i15 boasts other noteworthy features also like its excellent Real 4k video quality & image stabilization. Enabling the wind noise reduction feature also helps (but this works without mic).; I already have a fancy action camera that cost a lot, but I wanted a cheaper option for filming outdoors. Eagle i15 is amazing for the price! It feels like a high-quality camera, even though it's much cheaper. It blew me away with its value for money.
The camera boasts a ton of features, even more than I ever thought I'd need, and the interface is incredibly user-friendly. Plus, the buttons and menus are really easy to figure out. This camera is a serious contender and could be a game-changer for anyone looking for a powerful action camera without breaking the bank; Hey everyone hope this helps you in your buying decision as I have been using it for more than 2 weeks now. The EAGLE i15 Pro Max is more than just an action camera. With its advanced time lapse capabilities, it's a powerful tool for storytellers and adventurers who want to capture the essence of their journeys in a unique and captivating way. The 4K recording, durable build, and vlogger-friendly features make it a well-rounded option for those seeking an action camera that can do it all.
Waterproof case given with the camera worked really well during rafting. I could use it underwater (with waterproof case attached) & videos were clear even with water splashing from the river. No issues faced till now"""

Light weight; Panasonic G7 is a very sturdy well built 4K camera which is ideal for both Still and video photography. The price is also good on Amazon; I will update review as I go:
The 4k camera with interchangeable lenses, what else you can get?
It is overpriced in India, but there is no competition for it in India yet. 16 MP is low but if paired with some nice cheap lense, it does deliver cinematic pictures and videos.

I have 3 different lenses for it and it does the job for me.

I will update more as time permits; I kept it in cart when it is 73,000 then i saw it turned upto 1 lakh something..... Its beter to import... Amazon.Com.. It cost u about 34,000 think wat is btr.... If u have someone in other countries btr to tell bring it... 32,000 outside means 449 dolar or smthng.... Good camera i like it.... Check sony a6300 too....; This is the best camera you can buy at this price. No other camera is this cheap with features like Panasonic G7. Totally recommended for cinematographers.; NSA camera YouTube channel gav VLOGS; Got the camera from another source at a very attractive price. I am loving this camera. I have no previous of DSLR experience or micro-third cameras, but I am learning it with this camera. The camera is excellent. The kit lens from Lumix is super, it a ""jack of all trade"" for beginners like me. The Panasonic bag provided with the G7 is of excellent quality. It can hold the camera and at least 3-4 lenses. The bag is very strong and looks to weather rough use. A 32 GB SD card also comes with the camera.

I have checked the 4K movie too, but I think I won't be able to use this feature much because of storage constraint. A 15 secs 4K video clips take 615MB of storage! So, making a 10 min video will eat up 60 GB storage at least. 1080p HD is very good & I am quite familar with the 1080p 60fps format from my previous Canon Vixia R50 camcoder experience. And at present I will stick to it.

The 16 MP in compare to other 24 MP cameras does not matter much to me, I am not into printing profession. The kit lens can capture more than enough details, which will work great for me. The auto-focus is quite good and the camera is very quick.

The only bad thing is the battery, the 1200mAh battery just do not have enough juice for video recording sessions. I will need at least 180 mins of recording time, but the battery will only last upto 50-60 mins. So, I will have to stock extra batteries. I am not very keen on these cheap Chinese AC adapter with DC coupler thing as any power surge can damage my beautiful equipment.

Nobody can beat this Panasonic micro-third G7 camera in combination to the cheap & high quality lenses. I already got the 25 mm prime lens and now I have ordered the super hit 45mm-150mm zoom lens on Amazon. My kit is complete with the 14mm-44mm kit lens, 25 mm prime & the 45mm-150mm zoom lens. Total cost of ownership is less than 60K, which is much less than body price of entry level Nikon/Canon/Fuji with 4K option. The beauty is when I upgrade to GH5, I have the minimum lens kit ready.

Pros:
- Best budget 4K camera money can buy
- Excellent for both video and photo shoot
- Sharp photos, true color
- Cheap but best quality lenses from Lumix
- Low cost of ownership
- Best kit lens (14-42mm) compare to any DSLR / micro-third cameras
- 4K video recording
- 1080p at 60 fps
- Photos at ISO 6400 is quite good
- High quality, weather resistant bag
- 32 GB SD card supplier
- Supports the 64 GB UHS v30 SD card from SanDisk
- Lumix lenses are the cheapest compare to any other brand lenses

Cons:
- Battery is only 1200 mAh, which may not be enough
- No in body stabilization
- Not weather & dust proof; Todos sabemos que las camaras de calidad tanto Reflex como Mirorless son caras. Yo uso la camara para trabajar, tenemos una agencia de marketing digital. Antes usaba la Canon Rebel T5i y ahora estamos usando esta Panasonic Lumix G7.

Principales diferencias entre la G7 y la Rebel T5i:

TAMAÑO Ganador: Lumix G7 - La G7 es mirrorless por lo que es mas chica de tamaño y mas ligera . Ademas usa sensor micro cuatro tercios por lo que los lentes son mas compactos comparados con los de la Canon.

CALIDAD EN FOTOGRAFIA Ganador: Lumix G7 - Usamos tanto la Canon T5i como la Lumix G7 para tomar fotografia de comida y creemos que la G7 es mejor que la T5i por la viveza de los colores. El unico punto negativo de la G7 es que las fotos son en tamaño 16MB y las de la Canon T5i es de 18MB.

CALIDAD EN VIDEO Ganador: Lumix G7 - La G7 graba en 4K por lo que no hay punto de comparación. En video la T5i no tiene nada que hacer contra la G7.

FUNCIONES EXTRAS: Ganador: Lumix G7 - Aun no termino de descubrir al 100% la camara, pero hasta ahora he visto dos funciones muy practicas que no tiene la T5i. La primera es foto en 4K; basicamente te permite grabar pequeños clips de video y de ahi sacar fotos 4K de excelente calidad de 8MB. Y la otra funcion es la de timelapse: se pueden crear los efectos de timelapse muy fácilmente.

FACILIDAD DEL SOFTWARE: Ganador: Canon T5i - Quiza es porque aun no me acostumbro al sistema de Panasonic, pero se me hacia mas facil el sistema Canon. Pero igual aquí es cuestión de acostumbrarse.

Creo que las camaras Reflex ya van de salida. Si vas a comprar una camara te recomiendo una mirrorless. Y si estas comparando entre la Canon T5i y la Lumix G7, te puedo decir con seguridad que la Lumix G7 es mucho mejor. Tiene mas funciones y podrás grabar video en 4K.; This camera is quite the bang for your buck! Great 4K video, lots of programmable buttons, articulating screen, and it comes with a lens as well! Only downside is no headphone jack, but I record audio externally anyways so this doesn't affect me. Also make sure you get a fast SD card, as slower ones will not work with the camera if you're trying to record 4K. Overall it's a great little camera the gives you almost all of the features of the GH4 but at a fraction of the price!; Me costó menos de 10,000 lo cual es muy peculiar para una mirrorles en primera instancia, la he estado probando para varios tipos de foto, el cuerpo funciona de maravilla y todas las funcionalidades que tiene la hacen extremadamente versátil y relativamente fácil de usar. Tiene una excelente calidad en sus materiales, incluso el lente, pero eso me lleva a la limitación: el lente. El lente con el que viene es bueno, pero muy limitado, evidentemente es lago básico y te limita en cuanto a las capacidades que la cámara podría tener. Puede ser necesario un telefoto y/o un prime de 25mm para tener mejores capacidades (también depende del tipo de foto que quieres tomar), que Amazon tambien ofrece.; This is not meant to replace the GH4, but it could. Small, easy to carry for long periods of time. Buy this camera.; EDITED 8/17/2015:

I recently received a Panasonic G7 from Amazon, and I have already shot over 20,000 frames with it during the seven weeks I've had it (with many different lenses, and with mostly using the electronic shutter), plus a few video tests. Since I already own the Panasonic G5, and GH4 (and I also had the G6), and have shot over 125,000(!) photos with these MFT cameras, I was familiar with Panasonic cameras, and also with the menu settings changes I generally make to get what I want in the images. The G7 fits “neatly” between the very small and light G5/6 bodies and the considerably larger and heavier GH4 (although that one is still relatively compact compared with most dSLRs, and its MFT lenses are also generally very compact and light – and this gear is FUN to carry and use!). I value the GH4 for its excellent EVF, great grip (it is easy and secure to use one-handed), its excellent set of useful external controls, its wide range of useful options in its easily-used menus, the excellence of its stills-quality (with selected type and sample of lenses, and with customized menu settings), and its great video capabilities. I value the G5 for its sharp EVF (the one on the G6 has better color and contrast, but it is not as sharp), its miniscule size and weight, its very good external controls and menus, and the excellence of its stills and video (although the G5, unlike the G6, has no external mic input, and it is without focus-peaking).

The G7 is a nice combination of the good qualities of both the G5/6 and the GH4, at a lower price in size, weight, and cost compared with the GH4 - although it is without weather-sealing and high data-rate and slow-motion 1080 video options (but it does have 100Mbps 4K-24/30P video plus “4K-Photo” options). The excellent EVF is similar to the one in the GH4, the grip is almost as good, the external controls (both buttons and knobs) are unusually numerous and useful, and the menus are similar to, and consistent with, those of the other models in the line. A few items have been added to what the G5 had: 4K-Photo/Video, the tone-curve adjustment shared with the GX7/8 and GH4 (I find this very useful!), “Diffraction Compensation” (I briefly tried this and decided to leave it “Off” – it progressively sharpens the image as the lens is stopped down to its smallest stops to offset the softening normally resulting from diffraction, but this can result in excessive noise even in good light - and this sharpening can be done better during editing), and an external mic input similar to the one on the G6 (but missing on the G5 and GX7). Using the G7's electronic shutter, leaving the EVF and camera always-on during shooting sessions, and using no flash, I get well over 600 JPG highest-quality frames per battery charge.

As for color and other photo characteristics, I appreciate having the ability to adjust EVERYTHING on these Panasonic MFT cameras (color balance and saturation, contrast, color-curves, sharpening and noise-reduction levels, etc.) - and I also appreciate being able to match surprisingly well the EVF's characteristics with those of my reference computer monitor so that I get very useful and accurate previewing while using the EVF (with a floppy wide-brimmed hat worn while outdoors to shade the EVF). These cameras are a ""tweaker's"" (read, ""perfectionist's""...;-) dream come true...!

Overall, I have no real complaints with the G7, although a few things bothered me very slightly at first. As with the GH4, the rear “dial” (which on the G7 is a circle of buttons as with the G5, rather than a wheel as with the GH4) gets somewhat “hidden” below the rear surface of the camera toward the “dial’s” upper right – but this is to keep it from being unintentionally pressed/moved by the right hand gripping the camera. It took me a bit of time to remember the new way to access exposure bias adjustment (I generally use A-Priority, setting the aperture for best lens performance with each lens and/or for best DOF for what I want in the image – and I often adjust exposure-bias as I shoot, using the excellent EVF as a guide), and it required a button-push to access this on the G7 (the G5/6 and GH4 can be left with the rear thumb-wheel needing only to be moved in order to adjust exposure bias). But, I discovered that with going into ""Dial Set"" in the menus, I was able to enable exposure biasing with a simple turn of the rear wheel (no button press required!;-). Also, the image resolution is very slightly smaller than that of the other Panasonic cameras I've used, but this is of little practical consequence. And, as others have noticed, the G7's (and also my GH4's) serial number tends to ""evaporate"" - and with my G7, there is now no trace remaining of that number. Panasonic has recognized this issue, and if both the box label with the serial number and the purchase invoice are retained, and if the camera is registered with Panasonic, the warranty will be honored.

Bottom line: this is one HECK of a nice camera, at a very decent price! Highly recommended! (A few photos taken with the G7 are attached...)

It was very easy to set up and begin using. He especially liked the feature of connecting with the app to control the camera with his phone. This will be useful when taking pictures in the woods. On his first use, the battery only lasted about an hour. But carrying the second battery will allow for more usage time. The quality of the pictures isn’t fantastic for printing enlargements, but this camera still works well enough for a beginner.; The camera itself is good quality for the price. The video capability is great. A lot of the pictures you take come out very blurred, like half. The other half are crisp and great quality. The focus feature is difficult to use - I figured out the capture button must be held lightly till you see a green frame, then you press all the way down. Otherwise the picture will come out blurry, especially is the subject isn’t still. The flip out screen is great. The ability to have attachments is great. The wireless microphone is a cool feature that really works. The only issue is the camera has very low lighting issues, so everything seems to be very very dark, if there was a way to fix that and the focus, the camera would be five stars.; My daughter loves this! She is just beginning her photography journey is has already taken thousands of pictures!!! She love the camera!! It’s great quality and takes very good pictures; In my first review I stated this product took the same photo quality as your cell phone. WHICH IS TRUE!! The seller reached to me and offered a full refund if I updated or took down my review.

But this totally surprised me, it was incredible! I did 2 dive trips to the maldives, dived for a total of 10 days and got amazing footage! Took it to 31m depth also and nothing happened to it, the water case is included and so are a bunch of other accessories as well, it has everything you need. I just used a D ring to attach it to my dive gear. It has great color resolution, wide angle, and got better footage than my friend's SJCam, which is still thought of as an alternative to Gopro but quite frankly this is way better for the price. Also because it's cheap you won't have the same kind of heartbreak that you would if you lost your gopro in the ocean haha!; Why do they make such poor quality stuff, I wonder. The way they try to get a better rating by dangling a mic at a throwaway price if you only show you have rated their product 5 stars put me off in the first place.
My suspicion about their intent was clear when I used the cam.
I decided I don't want the mic even it was offered free for false rating.
I cannot suggest any other related product since I haven't tried any other brand. I believe Gopro is good but I cannot comment as of now.; I recently purchased the FitSpark action cam, and I must say it satisfied my expectations, especially considering its budget-friendly price. Here's a breakdown of its standout features:

1. Cheap and Budget Friendly
The affordability of this action cam is one of its biggest selling points. It delivers exceptional value for its price, making it an excellent choice for budget-conscious consumers and beginners without compromising on performance.

2. Good number of settings
The action cam provides a wide range of settings, allowing users to customize their recording preferences. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a casual user, the variety of options ensures flexibility to adapt to different shooting conditions and styles.

3. 4K Recording
The 4K recording capability is a standout feature, delivering crisp and detailed footage. It's a significant advantage for users who want to capture their adventures with high resolution, providing stunning visuals that rival more expensive competitors.

4. Good Image Stabilization
The built-in image stabilization is impressive, effectively reducing shake and jitter in the footage. This feature is crucial, especially during high-action activities, ensuring that your videos come out smooth and professional-looking

5. Noise reduction
The noise reduction feature enhances the overall audio quality by minimizing unwanted background noise. This is particularly beneficial in windy or noisy environments, allowing for clearer and more immersive audio capture.

6. Better audio with external mic
The inclusion of an external microphone port is a game-changer for those who prioritize audio quality. By using an external mic, the action cam captures clearer and more nuanced audio, enhancing the overall viewing experience.

In conclusion, the FitSpark action cam is a remarkable choice for those seeking an affordable yet feature-packed device. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, this action cam offers an impressive array of features without breaking the bank.; Thankyou Amazon .the product is good

It was easy to set up. As it can rest on any flat surface, I didn’t need to install it anywhere but it comes with all the necessary accessories for a wall mount. But because of the flat design I can put it anywhere near my baby, and even if I move her to another room, I can take the camera with me. The 360° rotation is impressive and the video quality is great, especially since I use it on the phone mostly—even 480p is sufficient.

The best features are the sound and movement triggers. If my little one wakes up annd moves around and/or cries, notifications are sent to my phone and the feed is also recorded for that portion (in case you want to check what disturbed them). This is great if you need to be in another room—gives you peace of mind. In fact, the sound trigger feature is not available in other cameras in this price range so this was the main deciding factor for my choice. The live feed is definitely a boon to make sure baby is fine when you’re away from her. You can also zoom in on the live feed, which is a cool little feature that I was not expecting. Plus, with the recording feature, you get to have little memories of the baby waking up saved away for the future :)

The only feature I’ve not had a chance to test is night vision but some videos of this camera I saw on YouTube seem to show that this feature is solid in the camera.

Right now I’m on the Imou Life trial subscription because it’s free and will save all recordings to the cloud (up to 3 days). I’ll move to a micro SD soon though. Thinking of also getting a power bank to make it truly portable. Overall, this device is great value and I’d recommend it for parents looking for a baby monitor.; Brought the product and configured it. Very easy and lot of videos to support it. Good quality and wide range cover.; I recently purchased this camera, and it has truly transformed the way I feel leaving my kids at home. This device offers an immersive and unique perspective that traditional cameras simply can't match.

Firstly, the resolution is sharp and vibrant, providing a level of detail that makes me feel lively . Night vision is impressive.. The 2 way speak option from the app is an added advantage.

The camera is also incredibly user-friendly. The intuitive controls and easy-to-navigate interface make it accessible even for beginners. Connecting it to my smartphone via the dedicated app is a breeze, allowing me to view and record, adjust settings, and share the camera with your house hold members with just a few taps. There are lot more options like setting up motion detection, alert when strange sounds noticed etc..

The box comes with a b type adaptor slot with enough cord length. The build quality is robust and durable, making it a reliable option.

Overall, the 360-degree camera has exceeded my expectations in every way. It’s a fantastic investment for anyone looking for table top or baby monitoring camera. Highly recommended!; 1.

Produces good colors; Print quality is very good with photos taken from mobile..but camer inbuilt camera is not that good; Rather than looking at it as a camera printer, consider it a printer camera. Because you may not be using the camera as often due to inherent limitations of instant cameras.; The product stopped working in 2 months; I was confused between Kodak and Fujifilm but ended up taking this and am very satisfied. My reasons for purchase were:
1. Brand image
2. Amazing process of printing
3. Best option in this price range
4. Lower cost of film roll compared to Fujifilm; I bought it for my anniversary picture and I am very happy with the product.The ease of access and the print quality is good.Only thing which can be improved is Kodak can give a larger screen and it becomes difficult to guess the exact background.
Pros-Photo filter for variation in photography,Can be paired with mobile and act as a printer,laminated insta pictures for better longer life
Cons-LCD screen size and quality can be improved,Little bit heavy
My verdict-One of the best insta camera.; Picture quality is not that great. Better with mobile photos. Easy & fun to use.; I actually buy this camera due to good review about picture quality but in actual print quality of photo very bad not as expected. Genuinely I feel like it's a waste of money...; Ótimo produto; During the year of use, I took 40 photos, some of them were spoiled by the camera, but in general, it is a very wonderful thing that will bring you a lot of good emotions.; Me agrada que no solo cumple con tomar fotos sino como una impresora de ellas, y de muy buena calidad.
La autonomía de la batería queda un poco corta pero sigue siendo un gran producto, solo tengan cuidado cuando inserten los cartuchos ya que se puede arruinar el mismo.; I rarely write reviews, but upon purchasing and using this product and seeing the onslaught of negative reviews, I had to sit down and type one out.

First, I do not understand the negative reviews. Maybe some critical thinking skills aren't being applied when others have bought this product. You see lots of ""My iPhone/Android camera takes better quality pictures!"" in the complaints. Let's dissect this. Most smartphones nowadays retail for nearly $1,000 in total, and a key element in their advertising is not only the quality of the built in cameras but the constant improves from model to model. Of course, a smart phone camera is going to produce better quality pictures. It's one of the reasons we spend our hard earned money on them. If all we needed was a device to call and text, we'd still be using flip phones. Let's put our thinking caps on and remember why the little computers in our pockets can take excellent if not astounding quality pictures - because they're built to!

Now, this Kodak camera does state it prints ""superior photo"" quality, but it does not boast ""state of the art"" quality or even ""smart phone"" quality, because it knows its place and that would be a flat out lie. Read the fine print, people! Superior does not automatically equate to breathtaking, especially when you look at the product itself. Once again, this is a basic camera/tool. It is not built to be an equal to a smartphone which is essentially, as I said, a mini-computer; It is not built to be an equal to even the lowest tier of professional photography cameras. It IS however, built to be a simple, basic photo taking device that you can also connect to your phone, iPad or other supported device if you choose to.

It does what it says on the box, so I am happy with this purchase. I suspect other customers were expecting something far more complex and souped up, and that is not what this camera is.

Now, the only cons I have for it is that printing process is a little slow, but it takes less than a minute. The paper quality is good though, so I'll let this slide. You can't have everything, especially if you're buying something that is quite budget when it comes to bells and whistles. And that's another thing I'd like to mention - this prints on modern day photo paper. Do not expect the thick, flimsy paper that actual polaroid cameras printed on. If that's what you're after, then you'll be better off heading over to eBay or a pawn shop.

This is a modern take on an old school favorite. Understand what you're buying, and you will be a satisfied customer.; La calidad de las fotos es muy buena y el tamaño es suficientemente grande, a diferencia de otras cámaras instantaneas que te imprimen como mucho tamaño similar al de una foto de carnet. Las funciones que tiene son bastante básicas, pero si lo que buscas es la simplicidad y facilidad de uso de las cámaras instantaneas retro no te hara falta más. Las impresiones son económicas y de buena calidad. Alternativamente con la App de Kodak en el móvil puedes imprimir fotos de la cámara del móvil con todos los filtros y retoques necesarios como si fuese una impresora bluetooth. Ante un apuro también sirve para imprimir un par de fotos de carnet por impresión, eso sí, tendrás que ver que salgan a la escala correcta para que coincidan con el tamaño carnet. No tiene memoria, únicamente puedes imprimir o descartar la foto, para eso mejor usar el móvil y usarla como impresora. A los niños les encanta por ser sencilla de usar y poder ver la foto impresa físicamente. Resulta recomendable comprarle una funda para llevar la cámara y algún recambio de fotos."

It has a main compartment for Camera and lenses, one compartment for laptop (good for 13"" laptop or tablets) and many additional pockets to keep smaller items. Water bottle holders on both sides and provision to keep a tripod. Buckles for holding the backpack and side buckles to keep the main compartment safe. You can remove/rearrange the adjustable pads inside the main compartment as per your needs. Size of the backpack is large enough to carry a pair of clothes along with your camera gear. Totally worth the money that's what I feel!!; This bag is large enough to not only store your camera & accessories, but other stuff also. The material is good & there is also enough pad to all the walls to protect your valuable materials. Don't know whether its a waterproof material or not. The only downside is that the velcro lining is placed too high & the lower portion of the pads are getting displaced quite a bit. But, I must say that you probably won't get such a beautiful bag in such a price.; Material looks strong and durable. This is the kind of bag I was looking forward to. Has enough space to store every little accessory for a DSLR. The backpack is ergonomic and has both a waist strap as well as a chest strap to keep it rooted to the body. The main compartments are adjustable and allow for storage of 150-500mm, 70-300mm telephotos besides a 55-250mm kit lens as well as 50mm prime. There is separate compartment to house a 15” laptop too!. However mind you, this will make the backpack very heavy and less useful to carry around on your back. I’d be careful to carry only the lenses I would need outdoors only to keep the bag lighter for carrying around. Has two side water bottle pouches as well as a front storage compartment to keep all your paraphernalia...overall it is a large and decent bag which can become heavy to move around if you stuff it over.. I loved it...; The bag us worth the price ,when buckled up its very sturdy ,as they claim it is waterproof,i bought a raincover for the bag (cosmos raincover 5ltrs). the outside material is good but the inside pad segment is not strong to hold the camera and heavy equipments.
the problems which i faced
*When the camera is taken out the upper segment drops down.
*while taking out something out (which is tightly kept inside) the pad comes out.

im rating this bag with 3star because of the inner padding . but the outer side is good and feels premium . even the laptop compartment is perfect.

Suggestions*
*redesign the inner pad arrangment with sturdy pad.
*provide Velcro on the inner wall so that the segments can hold the equipment srurdly.
*if possible put a raincover attached to the bag .; I was searching for a medium size camera bag for a long time. I didn't want to buy a very larg size bag.
Finally I can say I found what I wanted.
This bag is medium size bag but it can carry all the equipment you have.
It can carry 2 camera bodies. 3 to 4 lens, camera flash, and other small gears too.
This bag is very sturdy and made with very nice material.
Looks and feels very premium.
Highly satisfied.; Quality of product is More than average. Its rugged, stong and comfortable. Never knew padding is velcro. Product could get scratch because of sharp edges of velcro. But thats too less to get bothered. But advantage is, compartments as such can be customisable.
U can even make a travel bag out of it with camera space .; Good one tq 😊 ☺️; Fits very well... although a bit on heavier side"

The camera works perfectly fine. Prints good quality images and will also record a voice QR for your memorable behind the scene giggles and joys. Do not expect the picture quality of the highest standards, this is meant to keep your moments in a print format as it occurs. Not everyone may like it a lot due to the individual pictures price. But to me capturing pictures and the joy of getting an instant image is far greater. Combo package gives you an option of instantly keeping your photos into. The fridge magnets are another good way to show your memories to the visitors. Though placing the magnet is a bit tricky.
I was looking at the Instax mini 11 before looking into pros and cons of both. Then this seemed like a better option for few extra bucks (with all the offers I got it for 10.4k approx).
*Give a thumbs-up if you like the review.; Easy to use, The print quality (from phone) is really good. Camera picture quality gets slightly out of focus/ undefined but decent when close to subject (the sound recording and frame option is only available in camera picture). One advantage of camera picture is that it doesn't print immediately, you can retake pics and choose the best to print - you can avoid under/over exposure this way (the rest can be stored in SD card). The photo book quality that comes along with this pack isn't great, so i bought another one. Over-all happy with my purchase.; Good packaging . Good quality . Go for it; Best in Instax mini Model.; The camera clarity is not at all good, though it can be used as a printer as it provides convenience of printing, one should rather go for only printer version from Fuji instead of camera; No doubt . . Go for it"

Wifi connection is also good.; Image Quality & Video Quality Good. Stability Excellent. Nice performance in all modes.; Pl avoid buying; I purchased this motion camera to record the goings on in the 2022 Rider Mania held at Vagator GOA held from the 18th To 20 th November 2022. Let me review this product real quick:

EASE OF USE: For a newbie (to the world of motion cameras) like me, the buttons took some time to get used to. I also had to refer to a couple of You tube videos to figure out the various buttons and their functionality. However, once I understood the various functionalities available, this camera becomes pretty easy to use. The overall build quality is satisfactory

WIFI Connectivity - You need to turn on the 'Spot Cameras' WIFI on this device, download the XDV app on your smartphone and then connect to the 'Sport Cameras' WIFI. This is one aspect that doesn't work as seamlessly as it should and moreover the WIFI connections gets disconnected frequently, and you would need to repeat the connectivity rigmarole all again. Till now, I haven's clicked photos or videos via the XDV app, so this should give you a hint on the phone to camera connectivity.

QUALITY of Video Footage: Acceptable for its price range, video footage shot in the day time looks pretty decent, night footage tends to get grainy.

QUALITY of photos: Nope, not satisfied with the photos I have clicked with PROCUS, I would rather click photos with my smartphone.

Battery Back-up: I didn't take prolonged videos, but I would make an assumption that you can record continuous video of around 25 minutes (assuming you started with the device fully charged up) .

FINAL Verdict: At this price point this camera does what it is supposed to do. Please do not expect superior quality pics from the action camera, use it to record videos.; Good quality camera at decent price.; Very useful product for a rider; Good pick for everyone...comes with lot of accessories..worth money; Only except under water cover, there is nothing new or extraordinary about this product.
You are better off buying a good smart phone with a good camera.

Camera quality in this product is like 8MP phone camera.
A good thing in this is wide angle. Apart from this feature, camera is not worth it."

However, my recent encounter with Video Camera Model has left me utterly impressed and convinced that it is an absolute game-changer in the world of videography. This remarkable piece of technology is a true gem that surpasses all expectations, and I am delighted to share my experience with this outstanding video camera.

First and foremost, the image and video quality are simply breathtaking. The Video Camera Model boasts an advanced sensor and lens combination that consistently delivers sharp, vibrant, and true-to-life visuals. Whether shooting in low light conditions or capturing fast-paced action, this camera never fails to deliver exceptional results. The attention to detail and the ability to preserve colors accurately make it ideal for both professional productions and personal projects.

Another standout feature of the Video Camera Model is its exceptional stabilization technology. Even when shooting handheld, the footage remains incredibly smooth and steady, eliminating the need for additional stabilizing equipment in most cases. This feature alone has significantly improved the quality of my work, allowing me to shoot on the go without compromising on professional-grade results.

Furthermore, the Video Camera Model offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface that makes it accessible to both seasoned professionals and beginners. The menus are straightforward and well-organized, allowing for quick access to essential settings and functionalities. Its touchscreen responsiveness and ergonomic design ensure that navigating through the camera's options is an absolute breeze.

One of the key aspects that impressed me the most is the Video Camera Model's versatility. With its wide range of shooting modes, frame rates, and resolutions, it adapts seamlessly to various filming scenarios, making it an ideal companion for a diverse range of projects. Whether you're shooting a cinematic masterpiece, a documentary, or a vlog for your YouTube channel, this camera will not disappoint.

In addition to its stunning video capabilities, the Video Camera Model boasts an array of advanced audio features that elevate the overall production quality. The built-in microphone captures clear and crisp sound, and the camera also offers various audio input options for attaching external microphones, ensuring professional-grade audio recording.

The battery life of the Video Camera Model is also commendable. Even during extended shoots, it provides reliable performance without frequent interruptions for recharging. This is especially crucial for on-location shoots, as it allows me to focus on the creative process without worrying about running out of power.

Finally, I must commend the Video Camera Model's build quality and durability. Crafted from high-quality materials, it feels robust and resilient, capable of withstanding the rigors of demanding shoots. Its weather-sealing ensures that it remains functional even in challenging environmental conditions, providing peace of mind during outdoor filming.

In conclusion, the Video Camera Model is a top-tier video camera that sets new standards for excellence in the industry. With its exceptional image and video quality, remarkable stabilization, user-friendly interface, and unparalleled versatility, it has undoubtedly exceeded my expectations. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable, high-performance video camera that consistently delivers stunning results. Whether you're a seasoned professional or an enthusiastic hobbyist, this camera is an investment that will undoubtedly elevate your videography endeavors.; I love how easy it is to use and figure out. The photo quality is very good for the price and I was able to figure out how to upload photos onto my computer easily. It works really well and I'm very happy. Definitely recommend to anyone wether you want to start photography or you just want something fun to take pictures with.; I bought this for my son who is starting to make some basic videos for Youtube. We didn't need anything overly fancy as he's brand new at this. I pulled the product out of the package and honestly felt like it might have been previously used. The inside of the package looked a little dirtier than one would expect from a new item. Upon trying to take a picture I noticed it didn't always work when I pushed the button. It seemed like it needed to be pressed harder than one would expect. And this is for my 12 year old. I can only imagine what a few weeks of usage will do.

Zooming with video on is awful. It is very choppy like something from a 2000 era 3MP camera. That said, he made a video and we were ready to transfer to the computer. I followed the directions and used the enclosed HDMI cable. It did nothing at all. It did not indicate a connection on the camera (per instructions) or on his laptop. I've never used his HDMI connection so I decided to try my laptop as well because I know that HDMI port works as I use it every week at church. Nothing.

I decided to return this and we will shop for something else. I have no desire to fight with an item that was defective from the start and don't want to risk getting a replacement to have the same issue...; I needed an inexpensive video camera to take to family functions. I'm happy with this one! Easy for everyone to use, even the older kids. Comes with an SD card for more picture and video storage. We took several pictures and videos when my family and I went to a zoo type adventure park place. We did not run out of storage. Kids can take selfies and vlogs for their social media. The screen on camera comes out and my daughter can see herself as she records herself. Good resolution and easy to transfer files to the computer.

I am happy with this video camera and it works great for what I need. A good basic video camera for the price!; Works great for my daughter she went to science camp took a bunch of pictures it did it was supposed to ."

The Digiocraft Proshot V3 Teleprompter arrived with such prompt delivery that it set the stage for what has been an absolutely delightful experience. As someone with 20 years of TV journalism under my belt, I’ve seen my fair share of teleprompters, but this one is truly superb.

The packaging was impeccable, ensuring the device arrived in pristine condition. Setting it up was a breeze, and the build quality is evident from the first touch. It’s clear that Digiocraft has put considerable thought into the design and functionality, making it a wonderful tool for both veterans and newcomers to the industry.

What truly stands out is the support provided by the supplier, Manish. His dedication to customer service is unparalleled, offering all the assistance one could possibly need. It’s this kind of support that transforms a good product into a great one.

And let’s talk about the price – it’s unbelievably low for such a high-quality product. It’s not often you find such value for money, making the Proshot V3 a smart investment for anyone serious about their craft.

In conclusion, if you’re on the fence about which teleprompter to get, let me just say: Go for it. The Digiocraft Proshot V3 Teleprompter won’t just meet your expectations; it’ll exceed them.; Very good and Useful Product. Worth of every penny.. must recommended for Content creators; Great value for money, is sturdy and should last a long time, they have easy to understand youtube videos explaining how to set up; I am writing this review after using it for a project. The teleprompter is very easy to use and the support is also great. I was given a free tutorial by the seller along with the purchase which tells you how to make the best use of it and the tips given were very helpful. It has been designed thoughtfully.; ; Cons:
Somehow I expected to get a stand with it. The package do not includes stand, so you have to get it too. It is much overpriced. 3K would be at higher price too.

Pros:
It is too easy to use. Nothing fancy about it. Download some Telepromper app and you are good. The mobile phone also works fine with it. Better than what I have expected. I will advise to use DSLR for shooting for the angle reason. Setting up mobile for shooting is a bit complicated. If you have to, use phone with black cover as it does not reflect in the telepromptor. Given remote is very handy and have good features.; I never thought that I would get such a good telepromoter for Rs 6500. I have actually sent it in a very good packaging. And its Material is also very strong And in this Prince range, a remote was also given to me, I liked it the most.

Overall thanks and lot's of love from
Krrish; I recently purchased the teleprompter from DigioCraft and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The size is perfect and it was very easy to assemble. It took me only 5 minutes to put it together, which was a huge plus.

The teleprompter is small and lightweight, making it easy to carry on shoots. It has been a game-changer for my presentations and I am no longer struggling to remember my lines. The screen is easy to read and the overall design is sleek and professional.

Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this teleprompter to anyone in need of an efficient and reliable tool for their presentations. It has definitely made my life easier and has helped me deliver better performances."

The kit is easy to set up and use, and the teleprompter itself is very clear and easy to read.

The included remote control makes it easy to start, stop, and adjust the speed of the scrolling text, which is a great feature. The build quality is also very good, and the kit is small enough to be easily transported to different locations.

Overall, I highly recommend the Desview T2 Portable Teleprompter Kit to anyone in need of a quality teleprompter that is easy to use and transport.; Great value for money, is sturdy and should last a long time, they have easy to understand youtube videos explaining how to set up.; ; ; I like this product and quality is also good as per the prize; The Desview T2 Portable Teleprompter Kit is an excellent tool for anyone who needs to make videos or give presentations. With its lens adapter ring and remote controller, this kit makes it easy to use with a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and DSLR cameras. The teleprompter helps you to read your script while looking directly at the camera, which makes your videos look more professional. Overall, this kit is a great investment for anyone looking to improve their video production skills; The screen size is not mentioned in the description. Too small.; It is really a good product and very useful. Will recommend this for others.; DESVIEW: These guys are leading the game in portable teleprompting solutions. I purchased the first gen of this unit way back and it was a great buy. This new wide-angle lens friendly version of it is an even better buy. Love it.

*Note: the included software isn't the best. But it does work. I personally don't use it often, if at all.
Slight loss because I don't get to use the remote - BUT that's not to say it's useless... I just prefer to use the voice tracking system of my third party prompter app (PromptSmart) on iOS.

Either way, the hardware is phenomenal and, while a tad on the high end of price, it's worth it if you use it often - and a no brainer if you monetize your videos.

BOTTOM LINE: It's a tad pricey, but I'm not mad about it. I'm satisfied and I recommend it for avid creators.; The text is hard to read, as the light is reflected twice, once as it hits the outer glass and once more when it hits the back of the glass. This makes it look like the vision of someone with astigmatism, that's not wearing glasses. Like me.. Except now the effect is doubled... Normally I don't need glasses, but I can't read the text. For someone without my problem this would probably only be irritating, as the text is still readable. When buying this I thought all teleprompters had beam splitting glass, as that's what makes teleprompters useful. You could easily make something similar to this with a picture frame glass. In my opinion, this makes this product overpriced, as it is just a good looking package for a simple glass frame. It came 2 weeks earlier than stated, so that's nice, but if I had a second chance I would put in a little extra time and money to find a teleprompter WITH beamsplitting glass... :( I give 3 stars, as the product is really nice looking, lightweight and easily mounts to any camera, with the provided step up rings that fit any lens you might have, but I really whish the quality of the reflective glass had been better.; This is an excellent product and it has saved me time having to memorise lines.; This is a very well-priced, and well-designed teleprompter. I'm going to do a full review on youtube (I use it in some unusual ways), but here are a few things to watch for. 1) the rings are a very tight fit. In particular, the ring that is used for storage, to keep dust out of the inside of the teleprompter, is *extremely* tight on my unit, and I'm afraid I'm going to break the unit. 2). the screws for the phone/tablet holder are quite small. For a phone it's not much of an issue, but if you use a tablet I wonder if the weight will eventually lead to stress failure at that point. 3) The design puts weight on the front of the camera lens, especially with a tablet, and when inserting or removing a phone. I eventually decided not to use any of the provided holders, but use a separate magic arm. That's fine. Still a great device.; Not exactly the most sturdy or well built (mostly plastic) but it does work well and there is very little color change in the video so the two -way mirror seems good. I guess the plastic helps the lighter weight which is important because the unit sits on the camera filter thread. It is quite large, which is good for reading, but it blocks the flip out camera screen, so alignment is a little tricky. Well packaged."

The 5K resolution it offers at such an affordable price is simply remarkable. I never thought I could get such excellent video quality without breaking the bank.

If you're in the market for an affordable yet high-quality action camera, I highly recommend giving the IZI Click a try. It's an incredible value for money, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase!; This is a very basic camera, very poor video quality also video flickering issue while recording,neither does it have any much function nor is the video quality so good, it would be better to visit a shop and buy it instead of buying it online. So that you can avoid wasting your money like me, Amazon has a return policy only if it is defective and not a refund.; Bought this on Summer sale for INR 8,499. This action camera is really amazing and I must say it has exceeded my expectations. The 5K resolution provides crystal-clear video quality, and the 48 MP camera delivers stunning photos. Stabilization not upto the mark, but ok. Data transfer is fast. Considering the price, this action camera offers exceptional value for money. Overall, I highly recommend the IZI One PLus; You just need a high processing memory card otherwise 60FPS will not work
Video quality is very nice
Sound quality is okay but it cannot reduce noise
Battery is also good
Value for money; Showing IZI new One+ in product description but have received IZI one normal one which is available at Amazon in rs. 1000/- less price.

The camera is not gud at all. Only good thing about this camera is accessories that we get with it, else everything is pooor. The main thing for which one buys an action camera is stabilization, which is worst in this camera.....dynamic range sucks ......a one minute video in 4k 60 fps takes 1 gb of storage which is too much as compared to the quality it delivers. I mean1 gb space for a video of 1 minute that too in poorest quality is way too much. Highly highly disappointed by this product. 5 hazaar or add karke DJI action 2 lena sahi hai. Iska wide angle ekdum bekaaar ....kora bakwaaas wide angle.

Camera picture quality gets slightly out of focus/ undefined but decent when close to subject (the sound recording and frame option is only available in camera picture). One advantage of camera picture is that it doesn't print immediately, you can retake pics and choose the best to print - you can avoid under/over exposure this way (the rest can be stored in SD card).

Just a little improvement with the mobile holder portion, as it droops down a little and the attachment part with the ring light is not well-grooved. Also no option to attach phone with the tripod directly without using the ring light.; Okay in this price range.
Light is good. Stand quality could be better.it is swayed most of the time due to its poor quality.
This product is okay for beginners.; Its actually worth it , it's price is affordable and ring light quality is also very good , I like the product 👍👍and also delivered on time; A refund coupon of Rs 100 is found in their box But on calling the number it is found that everything is fake.

Video and images are crystal clear and auto focus works like magic. Colours are very real and have a lot of options for people who want to experiment. No complaints about camera but Amazon these days is not what it used to be. They didn’t send me the camera bag and when I called Custumer support, they said they will investigate the matter first. They investigate it and found that they actually didn’t send it and then they said only way to correct this issue is to return the item I received and cancel the order and place a fresh order so that they can send me that again and guys, the new order would have cost me 14k extra and I thought it’s better to spend a 1000₹ to buy a new camera bag than placing a new camera order at 14k extra cost. I have been a regular customer at Amazon for almost the entire age of Amazon in India and these kind of errors were not even rare, they never happened. But recent days I have been through such insurances on multiple occasions. So, What Amazon used to say “ Customer is God” , but not anymore.; The product received was in great condition with all the mentioned things present in it..the delivery guy was a professional it was timely delivered and the man opened right in front of us with verifying the correct product received ..; I am a intermediate Photographer. first of all it was a risk of this much big amount from online store. I trust Amazon from the first and I am an Amazon prime member since 2 or 3 years . Delivery was good .Thanks Amazon . I am starting to know the camera it’s a beast🔥 . And I also trust Appario (seller) it’s a well known seller . Thanks for everything I will keep updating about the cam 🤘; Camera is excellent and there is no complaint about the product.
But I have concern about the seller.
As per the Amazon page a free camera bag also need to send with the product. I haven't received any camera bag with the product.
Even in the Sony website you can see a camera bag is free with this product. So not sure why the seller not provided this bag.; The build and make of the product are of utmost quality. The packaging was good. Although it arrived with cover wrapped on the box, so one could easily see that its a camera that is being shipped, but the package arrived safely. Thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery.

The package contained all the items listed in the product detail page. One thing that got me confused before buying was if a memory card is supplied along with camera or not. I have received a 64 GB memory card in the camera box.

Pros
1. Light weight. I have used Canon 6D and it was so bulky and used to hurt my neck while carrying around.
2. Fine grained control over focus. The manual focus is next level!!
3. Eye Autofocus works like a charm.
4. Electronic viewfinder and the options to configure what should appear in the viewfinder.
5. Wide array of e-mount lens available to gear up the camera to the next level.

Cons
1. Although connectivity is great with bluetooth and wifi, the smartphone app provided is not that great compared to canon's connect app. Also the wifi gets a random name for the smartphone to connect to.; ; The camera is fantabulous. Though I am getting my hands into photography, I didn’t feel overwhelmed using this camera. This being a very popular and capable camera model, you will find lots of guides and tutorials on how to use this one. I was also considering a6600 against this one, which is a tad bit cheaper than this model. But a6600 being a APS-C sensor camera, a7iii is better than that, this one being a full frame.; Qty is good, the instructions manual is easy to operate from it .
The lease are extraordinarily to take high quality pictures"

Worse service by amazon for this order. Dont buy.; This is multipurpose device if you love travelling or you are a regular traveller then you should have it; Feel like I am having magic stick in my hand. One of the amazing product.; Ho recentemente acquistato la Insta360 X3 360 e sono rimasto semplicemente sbalordito dalla sua performance e versatilità. Questa fotocamera ha portato la mia esperienza di fotografia e videografia a un livello completamente nuovo, anche se comporta nuove modalità di ripresa a cui non ero abituato.
Iniziamo con il design. La Insta360 X3 360 è compatta e leggera, il che la rende facile da trasportare ovunque. La qualità costruttiva è solida, e si nota subito che è un prodotto di alta qualità. Gli accessori inclusi, come il treppiede e la custodia protettiva, sono ben realizzati e completano l'esperienza di utilizzo.

Ma ciò che rende davvero eccezionale questa fotocamera è la sua capacità di catturare immagini e video a 360 gradi in modo straordinario. La qualità delle immagini è sorprendente, con colori vibranti e dettagli nitidi. La modalità 360 gradi offre una prospettiva completamente nuova su ogni scena, consentendo di catturare non solo ciò che si trova di fronte a te, ma tutto intorno. Questo è un vero e proprio cambiamento di paradigma nella fotografia.

La stabilizzazione dell'immagine è fenomenale. Anche durante i movimenti o le riprese in condizioni di luce scarsa, le immagini rimangono stabili e nitide. Questo è particolarmente importante quando si scattano video, poiché garantisce una visione fluida e professionale.

La connettività Wi-Fi e Bluetooth è un vantaggio significativo. Ho potuto collegare facilmente la fotocamera al mio smartphone android attraverso l'app Insta360, il che mi ha permesso di controllare la fotocamera, visualizzare le immagini in tempo reale e condividerle immediatamente sui social media. Questa funzionalità è estremamente comoda ed efficiente, ma l'esperienza con il collegamento con un iPAD è - ahimé nettamente superiore.

La durata della batteria non è particolarmente performante. Ho potuto utilizzare la Insta360 X3 360 durante un crociera in barca a vela: consente riprese per l'intera mattinata a condizione che la SD montata sia particolarmente capiente (ne ho installata una da 256GB). La Insta360 X3 è anche resistente all'acqua, il che la rende adatta per l'utilizzo in ambienti esterni e in condizioni meteorologiche avverse. Questo è un plus valore non da poco.

L'applicazione Insta360 è altamente intuitiva e ricca di funzionalità. Mi ha permesso di personalizzare le impostazioni, applicare filtri e effetti speciali alle mie foto e ai miei video in modo semplice e divertente. Inoltre, l'app offre una vasta gamma di opzioni di editing che mi hanno consentito di creare contenuti davvero unici.

In conclusione, la Insta360 X3 è una fotocamera rivoluzionaria che ha superato le mie aspettative. La sua capacità di catturare immagini e video a 360 gradi, la qualità delle immagini, la stabilizzazione e la connettività sono tutte caratteristiche che la rendono una scelta eccezionale per chiunque voglia portare la propria creatività fotografica e videografica a nuove vette. Non posso che raccomandare caldamente questa fotocamera a tutti gli appassionati di fotografia e videografia: è una vera e propria rivoluzione nel mondo della cattura di immagini.; I am absolutely blown away by the Insta360 camera! This device has redefined my photography and videography experience. The versatility it offers is unmatched. From capturing breathtaking 360-degree landscapes to producing incredibly smooth and stabilized action shots, it delivers beyond expectations.The image and video quality are outstanding. The details are sharp, the colors are vibrant, and the stitching of the 360-degree images is seamless. It's like having a professional-grade camera in the palm of your hand.The app integration is smooth and user-friendly, allowing me to control the camera remotely and easily edit my shots. The real-time preview feature is a game-changer, ensuring that I always get the perfect shot.What sets the Insta360 apart is its exceptional stabilization technology. Even in fast-paced scenarios, the footage remains steady and free from any shakes. This feature alone puts it ahead of many other action cameras on the market.The battery life is impressive, giving me ample time to capture all the moments I want without worrying about running out of power.Whether you're an amateur looking to elevate your content or a professional seeking innovative tools, the Insta360 camera is an investment you won't regret. It's compact, durable, and offers a level of creativity that's hard to find elsewhere. I can confidently say that this camera deserves every bit of its 5-star rating.Kudos to the Insta360 team for creating a product that truly revolutionizes how we capture the world around us.; Se pretende uma camera 360 para viajar, a X3 deve ser tia em conta.
Tenho usado para documentar os meus passeios e a qualidade de imagem é excelente com boa luz e aceitável em ambientes de pouca luz. Atenção que sendo uma camera 360 implica passar algum tempo a editar video para que se poder ver de um modo ""normal"".; Super Aufnahmen im Rundumblick. Ein neues Erlebnis mal seine motorradfahrt aus einem neuen Winkel betrachten. Auch die App funktioniert super.; Fantastische camera. Vraagt wel wat oefening om de opnames te editen. Maar groot voordeel dat je geen pc nodig hebt. Uiteraard kan dat wel. Op fiets of motor in alle standen te monteren zonder rekening te hoeven houden of je onderwerp wel in beeld komt. Is daarmee de ideale reis- en actiecamera."

Good value for a beginner use.; I already own a Sony digital SLR camera but was looking for an economical camera for my daughter’s personal use. This is one of the best cameras for price and features. The Flip out large screen is what I love most, especially it makes the selfie mode easier. It’s a package deal as it comes with inbuild flash, 32 GB memory card. Picture quality is good, not tires the video so far, so can’t comment. It meets the needs of the teenager at the price. They can be used freely and everywhere as they’re not bulky to carry.; This camera has truly exceeded my expectations with its outstanding performance. As a vlogger, I was particularly impressed by the quick and accurate autofocus, even in challenging low-light conditions. The 4K video quality is exceptional, delivering sharp and vibrant visuals, and the flip-up touchscreen adds to the ease of framing while recording. What sets this camera apart is the comprehensive package it comes with – a practical carrying case, two batteries, an SD card, and a mini HDMI cable, offering excellent value for users. Its beginner-friendly design and intuitive navigation make it accessible to all levels of users. The added pause function is a convenient feature that allows seamless continuation of filming. In summary, I highly recommend this camera to anyone seeking a high-quality vlogging experience.; This is a perfectly fine camera for perfectly fine people. Not for anyone with artistic or photography skills. Definitely for the casual or noob. Easy to use. Sturdy. Takes nice photos, has cool options. It's a win, really.; The camera it’s self if nice looking but the quality of the pictures is horrible and when using flash it’s even worse and blurry. The description is completely false"

I will share about remote in more detail after using it for a while.😃; The Desview T12 Aluminum Alloy Teleprompter is a reliable and versatile tool. Its sturdy construction and sleek design ensure durability and easy setup. The 12-inch beamsplitter glass provides clear and readable text reflection, while its compatibility with various devices and software makes it highly flexible. The adjustable features allow for personalized viewing angles and distances. With its competitive price, the T12 offers excellent value for anyone in need of a professional teleprompting solution.; This product is very easy to use and very good quality; I recently purchased this teleprompter, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations! The build quality is robust, ensuring stability during my recordings. The clear glass provides excellent visibility, making my presentations flow smoothly. Setup was a breeze, and it's compatible with all my devices, which is a huge plus. The customer service was top-notch, adding to an already great buying experience. Highly recommend for anyone looking to enhance their video production quality.; Very good quality product, value for money, and above all very quick service by the seller.; I recently received the Desview Teleprompter and I must say, it has already become an indispensable tool in my video production setup. This teleprompter has truly transformed my filming experience.

Build quality is top-notch.I had it set up and ready to use in no time. Easy to integrate into my current equipment.

Desview Teleprompter is its compatibility with various devices.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Desview Teleprompter and would highly recommend it to any content creator, vlogger, or aspiring filmmaker. It has elevated the quality of my videos, improved my on-camera presence, and saved me precious time during production. If you're in the market for a reliable teleprompter, look no further – this is the one to get!; It's value of money (Full Paisa vasool) Light wait.Easy to carry anywhere. Its installation is very easy.Mirror glass is very cool.Remote is very light weight and easy to handle.operation is very smooth.Its size is very little and compact.Its joystic is very smooth.Remote function are very easy and smooth in use . Compared to other teleprompter in this or its max value .It is very easy in installation and operation.I am suggesting to purchase and use this item Because in this value it is very very good product. Once purchase it and start your channel, online lecture .Record any thing without any obstacles. I am currently enjoying with this product.Me and my family is using it and recording the program.Now have started more recording after its purchase.I suggest all to purchase this product without any hesitation. Its helping me a lot in my anchoring, Its very useful.; I do a lot of talking head videos for my brand marketing and also use a teleprompter to interview clients. It helps in maintaining eye contact.

- This product is solid! It feels great.
- Comes with a top notch camera mounting plate and you can easily put your professional cameras like Sony Fx6.
- You can use your video tripod or photo tripod without head also. That saves your head for a monopod to use on a B camera.
- The whole setup from its case to tripod takes less than 5 minutes which is superb!
- The carry case is excellent.

This one fits a tablet up to 11inches and thats the highest you can get for a tablet based teleprompter in the market.

- I highly y recommend buying this model.

I also looked for other models from this brand and mostly they were mounted on the camera lens. I would never risk putting anything on top of my lens as all the weight goes into the camera body mount. Those models are fine if you are using a lightweight smartphone. let's say under 300 gms.

I am going to put my iPad and use a voice recognition teleprompter app with my professional camera setup.

I'll post my setup photos in a few days. Very excited to take it on a professional set for a shoot next week.; Tudo exatamente como deve ser. Sem contratempos, sem aborrecimentos.; Ive had two glidegears and this is much better, hopefully glidegear take note. 1) Standard manfrotto plate!! So annoying to have to unplate your cam on the GG, on this one just slides straight in and locks firm. So much better. 2) Adjustable height! So simple but so essential. Again, GG fail on this. 3) Velcro instead of zips. On my GGs the zips were always jamming and just took longer. 4) Packs down pretty flat and small, GG is also good on this front, but other manufacturers aren't. Downsides) Not a huge problem but the thing that holds the tablet is very tight, highly spring, maybe a different mechanism would work better, GGs is better tbh. But overall this is a really superb autocue for anyone who needs mobility and fast setup times. (I run an FX6 on it no problem); First of all, it's pretty easy to assembly and operate, I've had it a week and used it on one paying job so far.

The subject was a gent in his late fifties who has reasonably good eyesight without using glasses. He had no problems reading the text from about 4 metres on approx 50mm lens in a mid shot. So that's great. I also had a lamp and a bounce directed at him and that didn't affect his ability to read the text.

I have two suggestions for the manufacturer:

1. When storing the device, it looks to me like it'd be easy to crack the glass as it's resting near the post which supports the camera. If there was even slight pressure from above (if you put something on top of the case), I think the glass would be in danger of cracking or scratching. If it was possible to remove that post easily (screw on/off?) it'd be safer to store. Currently it's held in place by four screws so it's not practical to remove between uses. Even with the protective foam between glass and post, I think it's vulnerable. So in other words, be really careful of it in storage or transit.

2. It would be really useful if there was some way of adjusting the font size with the remote. Page up/down and faster/slower is great, but also some way of increasing font size without having to step in to the app on the iPad would be a huge advantage.

HC, Dublin IE; Purchased to replace a smaller unit. I like this bigger size better and although not as easy to set up as other units, works very solidly. My only complaint would be the remote control and the software. These could use some more work.; I don’t have anything to compare this to since I have never bought a teleprompter before, but it’s great quality and works very well with my setup. I have the teleprompter mounted inside a ring light and use my iPad as the screen. Works great."

Amazing auto focus and the focus peaking for manual focus really helps. The eye detection is something new for me. It seems to work only in AF-C mode and not the single shutter mode.

Apart from photography I discovered it is really amazing for videography as well. You can get 30p 4k. Wish it was 60p for slight slo mo stuff. But you can get that in full HD.
Image stabilization is great for photography. For videos with camera movements you need a gimbal or something like that.
This is undoubtedly one of the best mirrorless camera ever built. 2 year old model but still serves a benchmark at this price range. It’s the best mirrorless camera you can buy for the price! It’s a legendary camera for both stills and video. From packaging to build quality, everything is top notch. It’s far ahead from Canon’s EOS R or Nikon Z6, as you can get 3rd party lenses from Tamron and sigma to go with your camera which aren’t available for canon and Nikon as of yet! I never liked the idea of using a mount adapter. Ergonomics aren’t all that good compared to a canon body but it’s almost there. But I like the fact that it’s very compact compared to rest.
For all the good things I said so far, I want to point one thing out. The back LCD screen and EVF is good enough but not at the level of canon or Nikon. It does the job but it could have been better!
Even in 2020, it’s the best what money can buy! Best low light performance, compact, wide range of lens to choose from, dual card slot and weather sealing adds cherry on top.; It’s the best mirrorless camera you can buy for the price!

If you are in a big city, I would ask everyone to go and get it from a shop rather than buying online as here prices are usually more. You can get it easily for around 130k. I bought it online for 135k as the place I’m in isn’t a big city and travelling elsewhere to buy the camera would have cost me 5k extra anyway.; I bought it for 1.27L body only
Amazing camera
But carry bag is included; I have used DSLR for a long time, for my entire career and it was a big decision to accept and adapt new technology. I was looking for a camera which is full frame as that is very important for any professional work but every full frame camera calls for a decent budget. 7M3 didn’t only meet my budget but also offered more than what I was expecting from a camera but I was not sure how will I cope up with everything that has graduated from DSLR technology to mirrorless, that is when I was taken by surprise. As soon I held the camera I was able to shoot, it felt different but the artificial intelligence that is bundled in this piece of technology is beyond expression. The camera doesn’t let you down, you feel that you were using it from day one and kudos to Sony for simplifying the technology to such a scale. My rendezvous with camera, I was elated to experience the flexibility of camera, focusing, FPS, video quality and all other plug ins with all guns in the camera battery life is exceptional. There is a very thin line between a professional and budding photographer the choice of equipment defines how thin or thick that line can be. Mirrorless camera like 7m3 doesn’t let anyone down and this is from my first-hand experience. It is a light weight block of modern Imaging technology which will never let you down with your experimentations and creative endeavours. I tested this camera under various lighting setups, different lenses, video, time lapse, quick motion, fps. It performs like enigma. So far this camera has made me realise that sony technology is going long way because after using this camera I have not touched my DSLR again.; ; Thank you amazon and sbi , got this product in 118k post discount.
I have upgraded from Nikon D7200. The image quality is amazing; Product is good but Amazon service is very bad so i personally recommend don't buy this on Amazon please bue local store or Flipkart.

1. Compact and lightweight design: Perfect for on-the-go shooting, travel, and vlogging.
2. Flip-out screen: Allows for easy framing of shots and monitoring while recording videos or taking selfies.
3. Fast autofocus system: Ensures sharp and accurate focus, even in challenging lighting conditions.
4. Excellent image quality: Produces crisp and detailed photos and videos, thanks to its high-quality sensor and lens.
5. Advanced shooting features: Offers a variety of shooting modes and creative effects to enhance your photos and videos.
6. Good low-light performance: Performs well in dimly lit environments, minimizing noise and preserving detail.

However, there are a few disadvantages to consider:

1. Limited zoom range: The ZV-1F's lens has a fixed focal length, which may not be ideal for capturing distant subjects.
2. Average battery life: The battery life may be insufficient for extended shooting sessions, especially when recording videos.
3. Limited customization options: Some users may find the camera's menu system and customization options to be less intuitive compared to other models.
4. No weather sealing: The camera is not weather-sealed, so it may not be suitable for use in harsh weather conditions or dusty environments.

Overall, the Sony ZV-1F is a solid choice for vloggers, content creators, and photographers looking for a compact and versatile camera with excellent image quality and advanced features.; It's disgusting. And now I regret for selling my kidneys, barely living now. Bye my back and stomach hurts now, time for dialysis 😭🤣🤧; I'll be very short- its the flagship product of Sony. Very often we get DSLR's only to know that photography is good but videography suffers- but no more. This Mirrorless DSLR is the expert at both. Interface can be confusing even to a pro DSLR user like me, but we get hold of it. You can start with Programmable Auto mode, that's best. Then move on to Shutter and aperture priority.
Shooting is superfast- 30 photos per second with full autofocus. It shoots high res pics like a damn video! Autofocus is blazing fast! Couldn't take a video in the brief time I had though.
Please avoid listening to negative reviews and ratings- review bombing by non users is a big problem. Although, its not necessarily value for money, but it certainly is the best performing DSLR.; This is by far the most powerful, features packed ,dominating champion of all mirrorless professional cameras there is. Hands down the ultimate, the king.

The 50 MP BSI 35mm full frame sensor packed with the sony exmor processors delivers amazing results, printable to the size of murals on walls!

Obviously I was worried to sell my beloved kidneys but now that I have the Alpha 1 with me , doesn't seem like a bad bargain I tell you. Ok, now I have to go my back hurts 😫; Outstanding image quality, and appreciate the real time focus ... as per brand..simply awesome and mind bogling image quality by standard; One of the best in Full Frame... Actually a benchmark camera for wildlife...amazed with the autofocus speed.

I never miss a shot now.; Valuable camera for bloging in india and many other like teaching and many more thank you so much Amazon's for; awsome product must buy , for this price. i buyed it 2 times its clarity is very good and focusing is excellent"

Comes with an Indian Fujifilm warranty card to register the product online.
In box items include only a lanyard and micro-USB charging cable. PS - no memory card included (even though the description says a 256gb card is included)
It stores up to 47 pics in the cameras memory without a memory card inserted.
Theres no cover for the front shutter - it's always open.
It's almost the size of an Instax Mini 90 Neo - but a bit smaller in width.
It uses the same film as other Instax Mini cameras, so that's a big plus. You can preview the pic and edit it with various basic filters before printing it. The filters are printed only on the films printable area and not on the borders. However, as of now, you can not edit a pic if you're printing from a phone wirelessly.
(Edit Aug2020 - you can now edit the picture when printing it wirelessly via a mobile. The app got updated so thats good)
I would definitely recommend going for this one since it has an option to save pictures onto a memory card and print later or connect to your phone and print any picture you want from that. Removes the chance of printing a dark or over exposed pic since you can first view the shot and then print, or print a pic you took earlier.
All in all a great camera+printer. But dont expect exceptional photo details/quality.; Looks cool, decent battery life and easy to carry around. Won’t fit in your pocket but is still travel convenient. Photo quality is what you would expect from a film camera. Cartridge can hold 20 film sheets at a time which is standard; Good product; I gifted this to my wife and she absolutely loved it!!! The photo printing capability from smartphone is just amazing. The quality of the photos are really very good. The camera is not upto the mark when compared with today's smartphone cameras but they are decent at this price point.

There are other features in this device (like remote shooting, audio in photo) which I haven't tried yet but they seem really cool as well. Overall, an excellent device at 10.5K!; I am in love with this camera. The picture quality clicked directly with this camera is really nice for its megapixel and the direct printing option is amazing. I wish there the app would allow more edits on direct printing but overall this has fulfilled everything i wanted😊; Quality of picture is really good. We tried both clicking directly from cam and printing from mobile phone . It worked for my 16 year old daughter as well in one go.; Amazing printer and versatile camera. I was actually wanting to buy a printer for instant print but got two in one. Camera quality decent, print quality good. Best part it can take print out of pics taken on mobile too.; easy to use.
picture quality is good
the size of photo is like visiting cards.
if you likes square size of your photos then u go for sq 10.; Lo mejor de esta cámara es que puedes ver las fotos antes de imprimirlas, incluso puedes usarla de impresora de fotos que tengas en tu celular, es la combinación perfecta entre cámara digital e impresora de fotos al estilo polaroid, funciona con los mismos cartuchos de la instax mini, incluso incluye una app para poder imprimir las fotos desde tu celular o transferirte las fotos impresas al teléfono, además se puede colocar una tarjeta SD y pasarte las fotos a la computadora, la calidad de las fotos es buena, no como una cámara profesional pero si mejor que la instax mini, además que tiene flash y la opción de grabar audios en las fotos, las cuales se imprimirán con un QR para poder escanearlas y oírlas, realmente vale la pena y no gastas hojas del cartucho porque puedes revisar las fotos antes de imprimirlas.; Es sencilla y práctica de usar, además puede guardar varias fotografías en la memoria interna o una Micro SD (no incluida) y permite imprimir de tú teléfono, haciendo que si no te termina de convencer del todo la calidad de la cámara, podrás imprimir de un equipo propio que tenga mejor lente, por último, puedes hacer ediciones bonitas con los marcos incluidos o si tienes tiempo y dedicación, hacerte unos propios.; I reviewed a number of instant cameras before settling on this one. It is easy to use one handed and has fun features like frames, moustaches, horns if you want them. I like the quality of the prints having previously used a zink paper printer. Bought through Warehouse, so the discount was the final push.; Mir gefällt die Kamera super auch das man es wenn es gut aussieht sofort ausdrucken kann. Meinen Kindern gefällt es auch Fotos zu machen.; Nice value for money instax camera! Gives the best pictures when you having good lighting.
Also really nice is that it has a bluetooth function which you can send pictures to print them via the camera!
Only downside is that it sometimes cannot take the filmrol (a new one). It keeps saying that you need to apply a new film rol in it."

Poweful processor coupled with loads of functions make this camera to stand out above everyone else in the same band. The only possible con is the gross weight of this device and together with a 24-120 mm lens it feels a bit heavy on shoulders. Need a little powerful grip to keep it steady while shooting. And, please, this camera is not meant for everyone in general. To get the best out of this device an individual must have good photography senses and needs to be a little bit expert in using it's functions.; Very good camera under 500000 good for professional photographer thank you Amazon for this product camera is very smooth and the the quality of camera bag is v.good; Good; It's an amazing equipment which is aimed at semi to professionals and who have good sense of photography.

Solid for photography especially wildlife as it has fast autofocus system and a reliable metering system from the flagship dx camera d500.; Black spot in Eye View Finder.; Not perfect when we have mirror less cameras; Cumple su función, es una cámara muy buena, el envío fue rapidísimo; D7500 is an excellent camera that delivers excellent value. It has features that are very useful for enthusiast and amteauers alike.; Máquina atualizada e de grande capacidade com a utilização de vários recursos. Fácil de utilizar, entendo ter sido uma excelente compra.; Excellent camera. This camera is not for beginners, it does have a learning curve. That said the features are amazing. The photos are sharp and clear; Just a short review, more of a user experience. I bought the D7500 for a month long trip to Europe. I was replacing a D7100 that had some nagging problems that often left me less than satisfied (It had been dropped - and repaired - early in its life, but was never as good as I expected). Anyway, I filled 4-5 64 Gig memory cards on the trip, and I have to say that this camera is far better than my old one. The low light abilities are awesome, and on the few instances where I needed to take a picture hand held in low light with some depth of field, ISO 16000 was a very viable option. Not noise free, but better than ISO 6400 on the older camera. Other features that made the user experience better: I could easily transfer pictures to my phone - very important to my wife and convenient for sharing or posting to Facebook when traveling without a computer. The connection to the phone also meant that I could share the phone's GPS with the camera and therefore get location tags on every photo. This worked very well, though it is possible that it negatively affects the phone's battery - but my phone is old and it is hard to really tell. (I think the automatic download was more detrimental to the phone battery, and it took a little searching to figure out how to turn off automatic downloads for every photo). As for the camera battery, it was also good, though again, the automatic download seemed to affect it a lot, as did a lot of activity on the display. The tilting screen was useful to have, but not as useful as a fully articulating screen (like the D5300). The touch screen was awesome, and made it VERY easy to check critical focus and work with the menu - even with gloves on. I was in a cold weather environment, so I had gloves on much of the time. These gloves had something on each finger that would let it work with an iPhone, and therefore it worked just as well with he camera. I liked the feature where you could use the live preview and touch the screen where you wanted it to be in focus, and it would refocus and take the shot.

I understand why people complain about the missing second SD slot, but as long as I carried a second card around, it was fine. I never made automatic backups anyway, and I can live without putting RAW on one card and JPG on the other. It would have been nice, but the other features are more important to me. The depth of field preview seems to be gone, and that is disappointing, but it is usually easy enough to take a shot and check depth of field and then take another. The exposure settings were a little more confusing to me, and I could not reliably determine if the camera tended to over or underexpose. I think I ended up using plus or minus 1/3 of a stop a lot of the time, and sometimes a lot more than that.

Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. I might change my mind after reviewing the thousands of photos I took on the trip, but based on what I have seen, it is a definite upgrade!!"

User interface is intuitive, picture quality is top class.
Color are obviously awesome 🙂
Gives a solid well built feel.

Also the camera is very responsive...the settings etc etc; Waiting for the replacement unit. The camera has a really good design. It's not very light weight. Can feel the solid metal built. It did overheat during 4k recording for more than 20 min. Could be a faulty unit. I'll update the review after receiving the replacement and testing. ✨

Update : Don't buy expensive products from amazon. They rejected the replacement blindly. I'm now stuck with the product. Buy from a local store. The delivery boy called and told he can't make the replacement on the day promised and reported on amazon saying the item is broken during their transit. And I'm no longer eligible for replacement. Their fault and they're denying our rights. Woww...what a policy from amazon. When i asked for refund I'm told the return period is over. All because of their fault. The seller was appario. I don't know if it's their fault. Sounds like scam from both Amazon's and seller's end. I'm totally disappointed.

They've lost a prime member and all the people in my contact atleast from purchasing on amazon; Está es la opinión del que la está usando.
Fue un regalo; Soy usuario de Fujifilm y creo que lo seguiré siendo en lo futuro. La calidad de imagen que me brindan sus archivos es inmejorable desde mi punto de vista.

Definitivamente es la mejor apsc que he tenido, inclusive más que la D500 de Nikon.

Su estilo retro y tamaño, invitan a llevarse a todos lados.

Algo es cierto, no extrañaré el tamaño de las reflex con esta maravillosa inversión.; Después de buscar en diferentes tiendas fue la mejor oferta de compra, producto original y llego en perfecto estado.; Beautiful camera. I chose silver. It looks particularly nice and retro. No matter what the online reviews state, this is a solid and beautifully-made camera. The instruction book is 338 pages long in English. The lens is superb. It is solid cold metal, with a wonderfully positive and smooth action. The viewfinder is like a full-frame SLR. The camera is heavy and solid. Altogether, I find it a beauty of a camera, and full-metal-jacket. I didn't know they made cameras like this any more. I have Nikon and Olympus, but they are reliable, reliable, reliable!

This is a normal 20 megapixel digital camera nothing more than that. It will be better if you add some more amount in your budget and buy a mirror less camera. Or else use your smartphone for vlogging.; It's been 3 months since i am using this camera, my Google pixel which is almost equivalent to this cost is better.

Packaging was also bad by amazon, not sure if i even got the original product; Value for money camera , excellent grip , enjoying it for my vlogs & photo shoot....Many thanks for this wonderful product from sony !; Don't buy it's very camera ........... It is worst in the name of camera ....
Take other camera for photo and video for both it is worst camera"

The camera works perfectly fine. Prints good quality images and will also record a voice QR for your memorable behind the scene giggles and joys. Do not expect the picture quality of the highest standards, this is meant to keep your moments in a print format as it occurs. Not everyone may like it a lot due to the individual pictures price. But to me capturing pictures and the joy of getting an instant image is far greater. Combo package gives you an option of instantly keeping your photos into. The fridge magnets are another good way to show your memories to the visitors. Though placing the magnet is a bit tricky.
I was looking at the Instax mini 11 before looking into pros and cons of both. Then this seemed like a better option for few extra bucks (with all the offers I got it for 10.4k approx).
*Give a thumbs-up if you like the review.; Easy to use, The print quality (from phone) is really good. Camera picture quality gets slightly out of focus/ undefined but decent when close to subject (the sound recording and frame option is only available in camera picture). One advantage of camera picture is that it doesn't print immediately, you can retake pics and choose the best to print - you can avoid under/over exposure this way (the rest can be stored in SD card). The photo book quality that comes along with this pack isn't great, so i bought another one. Over-all happy with my purchase.; Good packaging . Good quality . Go for it; Best in Instax mini Model.; The camera clarity is not at all good, though it can be used as a printer as it provides convenience of printing, one should rather go for only printer version from Fuji instead of camera; No doubt . . Go for it"

Adorei!!!!; Muy buen producto, fotos muy bonitas para capturar los grandes instantes en el momento. La única área de oportunidad es que todavía funciona con pilas y que el flash siempre se activa aunque haya buena exposición de luz, si se pudiera activar/desactivar el flash a discreción estaría mejor. Además, la calidad de las fotos está sujeta a la marca de pilas que se usen; se recomienda cambiar las que ya trae incluidas por unas Duracell.; Ela é linda, levinha, bem fácil de usar. Vale super a pena, a única parte ruim é o preço dos filmes mesmo kkkkkkkk (e ainda acabei usando um a toa porque tirei foto do chão sem querer), mas super vale a experiência e o carinho de guardar momentos em fotos reveladas!!!"
