This was the only one available with SATA port and reasonably recent CPU and a reasonable price. On that front, it is great.

However, I wanted to use it with Linux, and on that front I took a huge risk. Luckily, almost everything works fine on Linux. However, suspend to RAM doesn't work. To go into details, the BIOS doesn't support S3 sleep. It only supports S0x sleep, support for which is only beginning to mature in Linux. I am currently forced to use hibernate, which is slower.; Worst display quality , sound quality is also not good , customer care don't pick up the call , customer care don't response on return policy , not value for money; Superior look and light weight
AMD is always better than Intel in overall performance; I bought this laptop about 10 months ago,I have to say the laptop performance is good,great upgrade options, but have note that acer service quality is poor I live in Pune and the have only on service center,no pickup available, I didn't like the customer care as they didn't provide me with the solution,I am disappointed üòû with the brand after sale service . Literally pathatic.; It's not bad, but not good either. I bought it for 38,990. I was getting the same price for some other acer laptop with intel i5 1155g7 processor and IPS display, but I missed the deal. So, I bought this ‚òπÔ∏è.

Pros:
1- Performance is not an issue. Decent performance for most of the tasks.
2- Didn't do gaming, so not sure of that. But for programming, it's good.
3- Good for multitasking.
4- Audio is good. It's not loud, but sufficient and it comes with Nahimic audio (for which you will have to download it's app) which enhances it's audio capabilities. Audio can be optimised for different purpose.
5- Sufficient ports. Also have type C port.
6- It has control center to control fan speed, external keyboard light, manage fan speed, power.
7- Battery is decent and can last 4-5 hours on regular workload. But on heavy workload, it will last around 2-2.5 hours.
8- Lookwise it is good.
9- lifetime windows 11 home.

Cons:
1- Although display is antiglare FHD. It's not IPS, so it looks crisp but average. It's just ok for the purpose of coding or regular tasks where we just want the work to be done. Since viewing angle are bad, so for entertainment, it's good for single person for watching movies but not for multiple people. Display is not good for graphic designer who needs color accuracy.
2- There is no backlit keyboard. So, if you want backlit, connect external keyboard with backlit.
3- Although it has an SSD, I didn't find the boot time to be faster. It is fast but didn't meet my expectations.
4- Graphic card is not dedicated which is just good for normal work. I don't think you will enjoy gaming on it. It can play light games but surely you won't enjoy gaming on such system. And it won't able to play high demanding games.
5- Doesn't have activated ms office. You will have to buy it's keys.

Note:
You can install a separate harddisk (HDD) for storing data. Screws are provided with laptop.

For me, the bottom side became very hot and fans started making noise, when it first arrived and I was installing windows updates on it first used it on my bed, that is without proper ventilation. But with proper air flow, it doesn't heat.

Conclusion:
If you are limited on budget and only want your work to be done and doesn't care much about display quality or back lit keyboard or you aren't a gamer, you can buy it.
And if you already bought it, don't regret your decision. It's a ok laptop for most of the task and will get your work done.

UPDATE:- It hangs in middle, and everything stops working not even power button unless I press it for long time to force shutdown.....all my work was lost and mind you I was not doing a heavy task that it couldn't handle, simple web browsing and it stopped in middle, nothing worked....really frustrated..... Don't know if it was windows 11 issue or due to cheap hardware of this machine,ü•πüò°; nice laptop for the price paid...got good exchange price also for old laptop.."

Packing and delivery was very nice. Running smoothly without any trouble. Fast, reliable and reasonable cost.

The Thinkpad is just great for anyone getting their first laptop for academics or business.
Doesn't have bloatware start up unless you let Lenovo Vantage to load. But otherwise its pretty much just Windows 11 Home and MS Office 2021 Home/Student that pretty much all you need and you could install Linux if you need to. Its perfect!; This laptop is fantastic; Disappointed

I got a used/seal broken device, and it had warranty remaining only 8 month (the warranty was activated from Jan 2024 even though I have purchased it on June 2024). Contacted customer care and didn‚Äôt get any support on resolving the issue. They have asked to contact the brand for warranty claims. How could we trust amazon if they aren‚Äôt providing brand new device and we need to beg behind the brands to clarify the warranty date issues.; Light weight 1.4kg, brightest display,smooth performance; Very good laptop just little bit expensive; This computer works perfectly If you do normal tasks like watching videos ,creating documents, making an application. But high level tasks like installing multiple IDVs and building apps then you face some performance issuez. The base speed is showing as 1.3Ghz that‚Äôs pretty low. But the battery and build quality is really good and sound is average.; Lenovo has given this small beauty it has all the functions that you need in the day to day life Windows 11 Pro pre installed is a definite value ad office 360 is available on a trial but you can very well purchase office 2021 and proceed it is a very cute small and strong machine in terms of multi tasking multiple programs run in the background without any problem"

The performance of the battery is good.

I purchased it on 16/05/2024 and submitted the Amazon invoice, P-slip/warranty but Lenovo is not accepting the date of purchase for warranty purpose. Looks like they are not accepting Amazons documents (Invoice and P-slip/warranty) as proof of purchase date.

Further for every reply or updating to correct the purchase date, I have to go through the entire process of submitting address and other details again and again.

Thank you amazon üôè; Pro - Well built quality. Nice display. Fast booting. Best laptop in this price range.

Con - No MS Office.; Excellent laptop - have been using it for close to a year now - no issues at all!
smooth and powerful - the 16GB RAM & SSD makes it real fast and responsive; The laptop is great
Latest 13th Gen processor
Display is awesome
Light weight and slim
Battery backup is more than 7 hours; a few times display went into disarray. i was shocked. it hasn't been even a month. I am worried. i dunno if it's a software problem or hardware problem. it became alright after restart. never trust chinese companies; I really liked the product and got it at a very good price INR 43990, after that it went unavailable. I think only few stocks were left as it was a 2023 model. The body, look and feel is similar to mac book, touch pad is very smooth and processing & windows transition speed is really superb and display is really great considering the price. Earlier i was bit hesitant to buy this one, but after buying it have no regret at all. Thanks to Amazon and Seller both for providing me value for money item at a very good price.; Very good product, amazing style slim.; The laptop has a H series CPU. H-series is better than P and far better than U. So, for routine activities, this laptop is more than sufficient. Screen quality, brightness, visibility angle and color reproduction are all great. Wifi and BT works as expected. Audio quality is acceptable. Trackpad is good too. No heating issues. It has nice metal body. This laptop is a good choice for work, education and for general home usage for everyone.

Default setting for keyboard backlight timeout (15s) is annoying. One has to change it in Honor PC Manager. It is possible to play games with the provided Intel graphics, but that's not this laptop is meant for. Included charger's external casing is poorly designed. If there is a switch next to power socket, it will be pushed to ON when you plug in. Charger gets hot sometimes, not worrisome though. When installing your own Windows copy you will need drivers. One needs to go their China website and search based on serial number to get Honor PC manager. It will download all drivers. I wish this gets simpler.

Product support is a big let down. I had a DOA product. Getting a replacement taught me various lessons about this company. If you worry about hardware support, think twice."

Being a new comer in the laptop market it has the same quality and specifications which some renowned company's laptop have
That too at lowest prices
Very much satisfied with the product
Very smooth and value for money
But one demerit is its battery life it's too low; Product not working and operating system very slow; This laptop is totally based for students who have their online lectures and for basic office work like excell website data entry,etc. You cannot except gaming performance on this laptop. Basic games would run but that too on a very low graphics settings and it will be a very sluggish experience. Build quality is good but not very nice, cause it makes sounds while opening hinges, even while it's been just 20 days. Trackpad can be a little better in terms of quality cauz the size is very big and comfortable. The keyboard does it's work but it's a rubber keyboard and not a chicklet keyboard. Also it does not support backlit keyboard. But still typing exp. Is very good at this price point. Camera is not good, it will not give proper colours and is very much zoomed. But again at this price point, it is not a big issue couz u can use ur smartphone cam with droidcam software. Also this laptop does not come with cooling fan. So it gets little heated some times if heavy tasks is being done. Battery life is decent at this price point, easily lasts for almost 6 to 7 hours for nonstop work. It is also very handy due to its 14 inch display size.
Besides you won't get common HDMI port, micro hdmi is there. And lan port is also missing. But you can find solutions for both on Amazon.

Conclusion: Buy it straight away if you only have to use it for yt & lect & basic office work.; i love this laptop thus laptop is not a book this laptop is a very trendy laptop and so much use full everyone, so please all of you i am suggest this chuwi laptop.; Google play store is not working
Sound is very low; The notebook is good for daily light work use; Never buy this Chuwi Herobook 14.1 product.

With in 10 days laptop shutdown unexpectedly.

Laptop when lugged-in showing battery is 100% when you start working it shuts down unexpectedly and after restarting battery shows low and problem continues.

Seller here at Amazon is useless and can't offer refund.

Support is rubbish, I went to Vadodara service center, they took my laptop and kept for 10 days and when returned - laptop OS was downgrade from Window 11 to 10 and battery problem continues.

I am still chasing for my full refund and I will get it anyhow and if required will go to consumer protection complaint formal legal route if support or seller don't provide refund.; Laptop sound quality is very low, cannot hear properly. It is a value buy; Necesitaba un pc para instalar Office 2016 pero no tengo mucho espacio en casa as√≠ que opt√© por un port√°til. Como digo, era para instalar versiones antiguas de Office 2016, nada de gaming o edici√≥n, as√≠ que no necesitaba ning√∫n pepino y quer√≠a gastarme lo justo.
Despu√©s de buscar en bastantes tiendas f√≠sicas, llegu√© a Amazon y vi esta marca, Chuwi, que no tiene malas valoraciones, la calidad-precio parece buena y ten√≠a un descuento de un 15%, as√≠ que lo compr√© y de momento genial.
En varios comentarios vi que no ten√≠a √ë, y no es cierto, lleva 3 teclados adaptables, uno con √±, otro jurar√≠a que es alem√°n, el otro creo que franc√©s y el otro no lo s√© realmente pero lo importante, lleva √ë.
El port√°til es color plateado, para el precio que tiene no parece demasiado plastiquete y tiene Usbs a ambos lados, salida hdmi, auricular y ranura para micro sd. Echo en falta una toma para Ethernet, pero es muy fino.
No entiendo mucho de procesador ni de caracter√≠sticas espec√≠ficas pero veo que va r√°pido, arranca r√°pido, las apps se abren bien, y la conectividad tanto por Wifi como por Bluetooth va genial.
Ya he instalado el Office 16, que era lo que interesaba, as√≠ como varias apps que no trae, ya que viene con Windows 10, como Chrome, y funciona todo con fluidez.
El uso que le voy a dar es dom√©stico, simple ofim√°tica casera pero a√∫n as√≠ he querido probar como va a la hora de ver pel√≠culas o series y aguanta bien pel√≠culas de 1080p, la pantalla se ve bien y el audio es bueno. La calidad de la pantalla est√° bien, la imagen en las series y pel√≠culas que he probado es buena.
La duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a est√° en torno a las 5-6 horas y la carga en unas 2 horas. Imagino que es lo normal, no estoy muy seguro, pero mi idea es utilizarlo conectado.
Imagino que con el tiempo se ir√° ralentizando al actualizar las apps y dem√°s, pero precisamente por eso no quer√≠a gastarme ni 1000 euros ni 500, porque los caros tambi√©n se quedan atrasados.
En definitiva, considero que para el uso que le estoy dando y que le voy a dar es una muy buena compra.; Ich habe einen einfachen Laptop f√ºr zu Hause und unterwegs gesucht. Ich nutze ihn √ºberwiegend zum surfen, E-Mail schreiben und einfache Office Anwendungen. Ab und zu ein Video oder Film sollte er auch ohne Probleme abspielen k√∂nnen.

Aufgrund des Preises habe ich mich f√ºr das Herobook von Chuwi entschieden.

Der Laptop kam gut verpackt an und ich konnte sofort starten. Die Installation ging kinderleicht (kenne mich mit Technik nicht besonders gut aus). Der Computer spricht mit einem und f√ºhrt so durch alle n√∂tigen Einstellungen.

Positiv:
Der Bildschirm macht f√ºr mich und meine Anspr√ºche einen guten Eindruck. Die Farben sind satt und hell. Es gibt auch keine dunklen Flecken o.√§.

Das Trackpad funktioniert bei mir auch reibungslos und leichtg√§ngig. Kann keine Verz√∂gerung feststellen, wie hier manche berichten.

Skeptisch gegen√ºber der Tastaturauflage war ich auch aber sie ist gut verarbeitet und liegt perfekt drauf. Es gibt kein verrutschen und schon nach kurzer Zeit bemerkt man sie gar nicht mehr.

Internetseiten und Programme √∂ffnet er schnell.

Der Laptop macht f√ºr den Preis auch optisch einen guten Eindruck. Er ist extrem leicht und leise. War mir besonders wichtig f√ºr Reisen.

Negativ:
Der Kartenslot ist nur f√ºr eine Micro SD Karte geeignet und diese l√§sst sich nur sehr schwer wieder rausholen. Aber mit einem Adapter alles kein Problem.

Es gibt kein vollwertiges Office Paket (√∂ffnet Dateien nur mit Internetverbindung im Webbrowser). Aber das kann man bei dem Preis sicherlich nicht erwarten.

Videos von einer GoPro konnte er nicht ohne zu stocken abspielen.

Fazit:
Man darf nat√ºrlich keine Erwartungen wie an einen Apple oder √Ñhnliches haben. Aber f√ºr den Preis bekommt man ein solides Produkt was die g√§ngigen Anwendungen abdeckt. Besonders das Gewicht und die schnelle Verarbeitung hat mich √ºberzeugt.; alles geweldig; Je voulais un PC portable pas trop cher, car je le d√©die qu'√† la lecture de mes fichiers audios.
La mise en route s'est effectu√©e sans probl√®mes. Windows a fait toutes ses mises √† jour. Il est rapide fluide.
Je pense qu'il doit effectivement manqu√© d'un peu d'autonomie, mais en ce qui me concerne ce n'est pas un probl√®me car il est constamment branch√© sur le secteur quand je l'utilise.
Je ne sais s'il est fiable dans le temps, mais pour l'instant c'est un bon PC vu son prix.
√Ä voir dans le temps.
La surcouche clavier azerti qu'on pose sur le clavier qwerti est impeccable. Ing√©nieux syst√®me qui, une fois pos√© ne se voit pas. On a l'impression que c'est le clavier d'origine.; Ho preso questo portatile CHUWI HEROBOOK PRO dopo aver reso l' Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C717 e devo dire che per essere la prima volta che acquisto un pc di fabbricazione cinese mi ha veramente sorpreso sotto ogni aspetto.
Ero molto scettico nel prenderlo, in quanto non conoscevo la marca e avevo il pregiudizio che sotto il profilo tecnologico e costruttivo fosse un prodotto scadente, invece si e' rilevato un ottimo portatile per un uso quotidiano, per vedere film in streaming, per i video in 4k e 8 k , e infine per fare fotoritocco e montaggio video non a livello professionale.
In merito il materiale di cui e' fatto, confermo che e' completamente in plastica di buona qualita' e questo rende il portatile molto leggero da portarlo in giro senza sentirne il peso.
Come design riprende la linea dei portatili Apple in particolar modo dei Macbook pro e i Macbook air da 13 pollici, sottile e le finiture sono ben delineati, il colore argento rende il CHUWI HEROBOOK PRO un portatile elegante, peccato per la cornice del display che pur essendo abbastanza sottile per alcuni puo' far sembrare un portatile con un design un'po' datato confrontandolo con quelli sul mercato di oggi.
La tastiera ha il layout americana ma nella confezione ci sono gli adesivi di diverse lingue (italiano, tedesco, francese e spagnolo) per cui basta modificare la configurazione che non avrete piu' problemi.
La digitazione della tastiera e' buona e confortevole, non vi sono ritardi nella risposta durante la digitazione tranne per il tasto di accensione che a volte bisogna premerlo due volte per accendere il portatile. I tasti sono ben distanziati e non si bloccano durante l'uso.
Per quanto riguarda l'hardware nonostante il processore Celeron, l'ottima scelta di Chuwi di installare un ssd da 256GB M.2 non saldata sulla scheda madre e una ram da 8 GB, rende il portatile reattivo sia nell'avvio, sia durante la navigazione su internet e la visione dei film in streaming su NETFLIX. I video in 4k e 8k vengono riprodotti senza problemi, molto fluidi e senza bloccarsi .
La batteria ha un ottima autonomia, se si usa per vedere i film in streaming o i video in 4k o 8k ha un autonomia di 6 ore, invece se si usa per navigazione internet e con applicativi Office la batteria dura 8/9 ore.
Il portatile CHUWI HEROBOOK PRO e' un ottimo prodotto per la sua leggerezza nel portarlo in giro, per uso quotidiano, per navigare su internet , per vedere i film in streaming e i video 4k e 8k,per fotoritocco e montaggio video non a livello professionale, per gli applicativi office e per ultimo come pc di backup.
Il portatile CHUWI HEROBOKK PRO non e' adatto con programmi professionali per via del tipo di processore che e' installato, per cui se si pensa di acquistare questo portatile con il fine di usarlo a livello professionale vi consiglio di optare per altre soluzioni piu' performanti.
Consiglio questo portatile per coloro che hanno un budget limitato, se non si ha grande pretese nelle sue prestazioni, per uso quotidiano, per il lavoro, per la scuola e per uso domestico."

Mac is designed to let you work, play, and create like never before.","1. Performance:
The M1 MacBook Air is incredibly fast and efficient. The M1 chip's performance is on par with or even surpasses many Intel-based MacBook Pros, making it one of the most powerful laptops in its class. Whether you're a casual user, a creative professional, or a developer, it handles most tasks with ease.

2. Battery Life:
One of the standout features of the M1 MacBook Air is its impressive battery life. Users report getting 12-15 hours of real-world use, which is a significant improvement over previous Intel-based MacBook Air models. You can go an entire workday or more without needing to charge it.

3. Fanless Design:
The M1 MacBook Air is fanless, which means it operates silently. This is a big plus for those who value a quiet working environment.

4. Portability:
The MacBook Air remains one of the most portable laptops on the market. It's lightweight, slim, and has a high-quality Retina display. Its build quality is top-notch.

5. Compatibility:
The transition from Intel to Apple's M1 architecture meant some software might not be immediately compatible. However, Apple has made substantial progress in optimizing and making software compatible with the M1, including popular applications and operating systems.

6. Rosetta 2:
Apple's Rosetta 2 technology allows older Intel-based apps to run on the M1 Macs, and it does so quite efficiently. Still, some applications may not be as optimized or as fast as native M1 apps.

7. Price:
The M1 MacBook Air offers excellent value for the performance you get, especially when compared to some Intel-based MacBooks.

8. Integrated Graphics:
The integrated GPU in the M1 chip is impressive and can handle a range of tasks, including photo and video editing. However, if you're a professional video editor or a gamer, you might want to consider a MacBook Pro with dedicated graphics.

9. Limited Port Selection:
The MacBook Air features only two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. This could be a limitation if you need more ports.

10. Upgradability:
The M1 MacBook Air is not user-upgradable. So, you'll need to choose the right configuration at the time of purchase.; I am a student using this laptop for coding, studying, entertainment, video editing, and 3D Modelling. Here are the pros. and Cons. I have noticed till now:
Pros:
-Everything works like a charm without slow downs
-I can have many things open without having to worry about ram
-It is quite (cause it doesn't have a fan)
-Super long battery life
-The simplicity and beauty of the mac os user interface (ui)

Cons.
-When doing intense work for long periods, it does heat up and there is no way of dissipating the heat apart from letting it sit idle
-When connecting a mouse to it via a usb-c dock, natural scrolling needs to be disabled for it to work like it does on any other computer, however, when using the trackpad, natural scrolling needs to be enabled for the same, there is no way to disable and enable it for mouse and trackpad respectively at the same time and needs to be done manually
-The camera quality could have been better
-For some reason the pinch to zoom function of the trackpad doesn't work as intended in apps
In all, this is a beautiful machine made with the intention of allowing people to do their work without much hindrance and is not made for gaming.; I upgraded from a 2017 Acer Aspire Intel i3 Laptop (256GB SSD + 1TB + 8GB). And after the first day of usage, my mind is blown. Yes, I paid a hefty amount for the Air (Rs 76K with an exchange, Amazon took my old laptop for Rs 8800).

Display: 13.3 inches may feel small initially for those shifting from 15.6 or bigger screen sizes. Honestly, I'm already used to it in a day. Unlike my Acer, the screen is brilliant. Great viewing angles, crisp and the brightness is adaptive. I don't have to keep adjusting brightness levels all the time, the sensor takes care of it. Speakers are excellent for this form factor, they even have a very mild base.

Performance: It's off the charts. This M1 chip has 5nm transistor spacing making the laptop incredibly efficient. Plus it comes with 8 cores so multi-tasking is a breeze. I have about 10 chrome tabs, and 5 other windows open and it provided over 12 hours of battery life. Performance is flawless, it doesn't lag, no stutters, not even a hint of retard while navigating through apps.

Keyboard and trackpad: Trackpad is large. You can adjust levels of trackpad sensitiveness to your touch. A nice feature to have. The clicks are very satisfying as well. The keyboard is backlit, and the key travel is perfect. Takes absolutely zero effort to get used to the keyboard and trackpad.

OS: The laptop comes with Big Sur OS and right from the get-go you get the option to upgrade to Monterey which took about 20 minutes on my 50gbps internet speed.

Lastly, Amazon delivery was good this time. I had ordered a Lenovo 2 months ago and Amazon took 10 days to tell me that the product was damaged in transit. However, this time, Amazon delivered my Macbook Air in 1.5 days.

Update: The charger gets very hot and I can feel a very mild current (almost like a vibration) on the flap when the laptop is plugged in. This happened on my Acer also. Anybody else facing with this?; Ideal laptop for office / personal use except gaming. No lag, no hassles, great battery life, lightweight and sleek and looks like a charm.

Perfect device for customers who are not into extremely heavy editing and gaming.; Rare VFM offering from Apple. Great if you just want to do some basic productivity tasks and content consumption. Not suitable for heavy workloads like rendering or gaming.

Great battery life. I charge it once every 3-4 days with medium daily use. For light usage it goes up to one week."

I need to travel tomorrow and it will be such a big issue for me now.My work is suffering so much. The customer care people are also not responding. It has been a horrendous experience.; The photo in display and the video shows the laptop to have a USB C port.

Looks like a laptop worth it's money.; Not so good product; The laptop has a heating issue, and the screen display is not satisfactory. It may be considered as an economical laptop from Dell from the heating is not expected from such a brand.; ; laptop Performance is Ok , especially availability of genuine windows and MS office Home edition along with bunch of other software preloaded. only you have to partition the SSD into local drives at your end to keep Program files in C drive . Otherwise it is Fast , better performance in 12th generation i3 processor from 11th generation i5.
Heating issue is there in all dell laptops including this one, so i will wait for next 2-3 months to check whether this heating issue creates any problem in performance of laptop in summers.
Dell shall arrange to direct blowers not towards the screen as in present case , in my opinion the the heat coming from blowers towards the screen may reduce or impact Screen due to heat blow. Laptop also heats from below , so i don't think it is advisable to keep it on lap ( legs) , better to operate on table or some platform.; Dislike:

1- Good Battery Backup: laptop has a long-lasting battery, which is a key feature of Intel Evo-certified devices.

2- Fast Boot-up: The quick startup suggests that the laptop utilizes fast storage technology, such as SSDs, to boot up quickly.

3- Good Performance: As an Evo-certified laptop, it's expected to deliver solid performance, likely powered by a high-performance CPU and GPU.

4- Awesome Camera Quality:laptop likely has a high-quality webcam, which is important for video conferencing and streaming.

5- Clear Audio with Dolby Sound: The inclusion of Dolby sound suggests that the laptop offers high-quality audio output, enhancing the multimedia experience.

6- OLED Display for Good Clarity: OLED displays typically offer vibrant colors and deep blacks, providing excellent clarity and contrast for visual content.

Overall, a laptop with these features would likely offer a premium computing experience suitable for a range of tasks, from productivity to multimedia consumption and content creation.; I checked a Asus Zenbook, and Vivobook models before finalizing on this model. The display is excellent, the CPU is top tier, and the form factor is perfect for portability. On a light to heavy workload I got about 4-5 hours of battery life. I ran about 4 VMs on VMWare Workstation, and still it stayed around 75-80 Deg. C. The build quality is good. This laptop, with a Intel Evo Core Ultra 9 185H is good value for money, esp. when the competition sells for more than 1.5L; Bought this because it's
1. An Intel EVO laptop.
2. No touchscreen (Touchscreens are bullshit and cause additional battery drain).
3. Impressive specifications.

This is perfect for heavy users who don't want to game...but still it can handle most multiplayer competitive games like Dota 2, Valorant, CS:GO because it's GPU is Intel Arc which is much better than stock Iris.

Battery life is ok...when used heavily it still gives around 4-5 hours...if used lightly it can easily last the who day.; I bought this from a Lenovo exclusive store. I searched a lot for good laptop in the 1L segment. This one is by far the best one I saw.

I wanted to buy a laptop that competes with MacBook Air 3 as it was in the same budget, so I had 3 main requirements - Durability, Intel EVO certification, Display.

Durability
This is full aluminum body. So you are covered. Very good build quality

Battery Life
Intel EVO laptops will give awesome battery. I am getting 7-8 hours with heavy usage and close to 10 hours on normal usage. It will charge in 100W, will give 3 hours usage in 15 min charge

Display
2.8K OLD, 120Hz - Exceeds MacBook display. I am using a MacBook M1 Pro for work, this feels very comparable.

Ram and SSD
32GB LPDDR5 RAM and 1TB SSB PCle 4. I feel future proof with this

Camera is also very good, did not expect that. Also you can open this laptop with single finger without the laptop dancing all over your table.

Overall the best laptop you can get under 1.1L. Any other laptop with Ultra 9 is atleast 20k more.

(I did not get MacBook Air M3 because in the same budget I am getting only 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD, which I feel is not futureproof. I always need to carry a portable SSD and I can't play casual games, also app compatibility while coding. Answering this here because I know there are lots like me who can't decide between MacBook and Windows); I purchased this laptop from Lenovo's official website because there I got student discount and a free laptop bag.

Many people who have this kind of budget must be confused between this and macbook air m3. I was also confused between these two but finally picked this laptop. There's also confusion with asus zenbook 14. I will try to cover everything in this review.

1) Design and build : The build quality is really good. The aluminum body feels very sturdy. The hinge quality is also very good with right amount of friction, opens with one finger. The design is very minimal and feels professional. Although I think both macbook air and zenbook will have better build quality than this. But both of them are fingerprint magnet and attracts a lot of smudges. Lenovo does not have this problem.

2) Display : One of my top priorities was oled display with high resolution and fast refresh rate. And the display here is really good. It feels a little yellowish but it's fine. Better than macbook's display. Although this does not have dynamic refresh rate to switch between 60 and 120 hz which is present in zenbook.

3) Ram and Storage : Lenovo has nailed in this department. No one is providing 32GB ram at this price point. It even does not have a 16gb ram option. Also since the ram speed is very high, 7467 Mhz, app opening speed is very fast. This makes the laptop futureproof for atleast next 5 years. Storage is also fast with both read write speed close to 5GBps. Neither asus nor apple comes close in this department.

4) Performance : Who gives ultra 9 at this price point. Literally I have searched a lot but there is no other laptop giving ultra 9 under 1.1 lakh. The performance is, as obvious, excellent. It can handle everything very easily. I ran 4k 60fps hdr videos on youtube and it runs smoothly on battery power. Also because of the Arc gpu which has 2/3 rd power of rtx 3050, you can play AAA titles with good frame rates. I am playing forza horizon 5 at high graphics, hdr turned on and full 2.8k resolution and it's able to give me around 35 to 40 fps. I ran cinebench r23 and got good single and multi core performance (see attached pics). However the multi core score is little less than what I see online. Maybe Lenovo is limiting performance because of sleek form factor or because I am testing this in peek summer temperature so it's throttling a little bit. Air m3 does not come close in multi core performance.

5) Battery Life : It's giving me 7-8 hours on normal usage which includes web browsing, watching youtube videos and coding. It's good enough for me. Also it has biggest battery (84whr) compared to other two. Obviously macbook will give the best battery life (that's the reason I used to hate windows machine).

Other things like keyboard is really good and tactile. Back lighting is also very bright. You will enjoy typing on this keyboard.
Camera is average and not up to the mark. I expected better since asus and macbook both have really good cameras.
Speaker is loud enough and has all the details. Bass is lacking. Before getting this laptop I thought it has front firing speakers because of holes on side of keyboard. But don't get fooled by this. It has down firing speakers. Some other models of this laptop has 4 speaker system that's why it has holes in the front.
Trackpad is silky smooth to touch and it is very responsive. No complaints here.

So all in all, this is an excellent laptop under 1.1 L."

This was the only one available with SATA port and reasonably recent CPU and a reasonable price. On that front, it is great.

However, I wanted to use it with Linux, and on that front I took a huge risk. Luckily, almost everything works fine on Linux. However, suspend to RAM doesn't work. To go into details, the BIOS doesn't support S3 sleep. It only supports S0x sleep, support for which is only beginning to mature in Linux. I am currently forced to use hibernate, which is slower.; Worst display quality , sound quality is also not good , customer care don't pick up the call , customer care don't response on return policy , not value for money; Superior look and light weight
AMD is always better than Intel in overall performance; I bought this laptop about 10 months ago,I have to say the laptop performance is good,great upgrade options, but have note that acer service quality is poor I live in Pune and the have only on service center,no pickup available, I didn't like the customer care as they didn't provide me with the solution,I am disappointed üòû with the brand after sale service . Literally pathatic.; It's not bad, but not good either. I bought it for 38,990. I was getting the same price for some other acer laptop with intel i5 1155g7 processor and IPS display, but I missed the deal. So, I bought this ‚òπÔ∏è.

Pros:
1- Performance is not an issue. Decent performance for most of the tasks.
2- Didn't do gaming, so not sure of that. But for programming, it's good.
3- Good for multitasking.
4- Audio is good. It's not loud, but sufficient and it comes with Nahimic audio (for which you will have to download it's app) which enhances it's audio capabilities. Audio can be optimised for different purpose.
5- Sufficient ports. Also have type C port.
6- It has control center to control fan speed, external keyboard light, manage fan speed, power.
7- Battery is decent and can last 4-5 hours on regular workload. But on heavy workload, it will last around 2-2.5 hours.
8- Lookwise it is good.
9- lifetime windows 11 home.

Cons:
1- Although display is antiglare FHD. It's not IPS, so it looks crisp but average. It's just ok for the purpose of coding or regular tasks where we just want the work to be done. Since viewing angle are bad, so for entertainment, it's good for single person for watching movies but not for multiple people. Display is not good for graphic designer who needs color accuracy.
2- There is no backlit keyboard. So, if you want backlit, connect external keyboard with backlit.
3- Although it has an SSD, I didn't find the boot time to be faster. It is fast but didn't meet my expectations.
4- Graphic card is not dedicated which is just good for normal work. I don't think you will enjoy gaming on it. It can play light games but surely you won't enjoy gaming on such system. And it won't able to play high demanding games.
5- Doesn't have activated ms office. You will have to buy it's keys.

Note:
You can install a separate harddisk (HDD) for storing data. Screws are provided with laptop.

For me, the bottom side became very hot and fans started making noise, when it first arrived and I was installing windows updates on it first used it on my bed, that is without proper ventilation. But with proper air flow, it doesn't heat.

Conclusion:
If you are limited on budget and only want your work to be done and doesn't care much about display quality or back lit keyboard or you aren't a gamer, you can buy it.
And if you already bought it, don't regret your decision. It's a ok laptop for most of the task and will get your work done.

UPDATE:- It hangs in middle, and everything stops working not even power button unless I press it for long time to force shutdown.....all my work was lost and mind you I was not doing a heavy task that it couldn't handle, simple web browsing and it stopped in middle, nothing worked....really frustrated..... Don't know if it was windows 11 issue or due to cheap hardware of this machine,ü•πüò°; nice laptop for the price paid...got good exchange price also for old laptop.."

There is no lag during browsing or opening new programs. MS office is pre-installed. I had my ID for the same so no need to download.

Overall really good buy at this price range.; I just received the product and packaging and all looks good; The laptop is good and functions well as expected in all areas. The rest of the feedback is quite similar to what others have written. Let me focus on something that I have experienced uniquely.

I bought this device on 31 Mar 2024, but when I checked the warranty instead of 12 months I found only 1 month of warranty was remaining. HP Customer Service said that the dealer must have purchased this device 1 year ago and hence the warranty is coming to an end. Now since 12 April 2024, I have been struggling with HP Customer Service to get proper 12 months of warranty for me. After numerous calls, emails, and escalation to the HP Service Head, I was finally able to get a complete 12 months of warranty.

This was a PATHETIC experience buying this HP device. The seller/dealer on Amazon must know about this kind of trouble the end customers are facing due to the expiring warranty on their dead stocks.; After 2 month my mother will damaged. but it will repaired .so don't purchase this produvt; I bought this product at 28000 for using on my college as student
It's okay
Even DaVinci Resolve worked okay
Fine

Display quality is good but speakers volume is low, like on 100% volume it's seem quite low, but it's audible. Build quality is very good and it supports fast charging.

And I'm writing this after 1 month of usage.; I've been using this laptop for a week, and first of all, it's a good laptop with clean and nice build, does not look too gaming focus (design wise). 120 hz display is quite nice, and for some reason you can't go back to 60hz (no option)
Can run games smoothly (not on the highest settings) , I played genshin, sekiro, elden ring(mid settings), apex,lol and it doesn't lag at all, so I would say its quit good for games too, (tried valorant too but my internet sucks so I can't say much but it won't lag im sure), litlle bit of frame drops, here and there but thats like once or twice in a day so it doesn't really matter, the fans do kick in quite fast, the backlit of the keyboard is static to white/purplist? The charging is quite fast, you have to charge and play games otherwise it's gonna be laggy
The bad thing I find was the speaker, it's a bit muffled, it's not that high quality, i would say its average, it's not good, it's useable some people won't find anything wrong but it's not good (could just be on my pc only)
Overall a good choice for budget gaming laptop, although I would suggest buying the Intel version, if it's for gaming, there are some frame rates difference between them but is like 5-6fps; performs really well and build quality is v good, best laptop in this price range and is value for money. temps go up to 74¬∞c max on heavy games and is really cool while gaming.; lenovo ideapad gaming 3
ryzen 5 5600h
512 ssd, 8 gb ram & 4 gb 1650 gtx

This is a beast processor and budget gaming laptop
i bought it at 48k under some offers
And in this range ....it was such a great laptop (alrounder)
pros -: great processor ryzen 5 5600h, amazing 120hz display, with white 2 level backlit keyboard, good thermal, very useful lenovo vantage app for customise setting of battery & sound & performance mode etc., simple stylish looks and design of this laptop, all ports are available, keyboad is very friendly for typing with a good size of four large arrow keys, camera quality is good enough with shutter to open & close, boot time is less than 5 sec which is really very fast and shutdown in just 2 sec. upgrade option is also available for future with another storage add of ssd or hdd and another ram upgrade upto 16 gb (extra one empty slot for ram stick)
cons -: battery above 90% in normal task ...it gives around 4 hrs and in heavy task around 3 hrs...i mean to say that it is decent battery backup from the 45wh battery. because i m not a gamer. so, this battery backup is good
conclusion -: around 50k budget this laptop is the best gaming laptop in 2022...go for this lenovo ideapad gaming 3 laptop blindly i m very happy to select this laptop.; It is very good laptop. You can play most of games in high graphics. I have played GTA 5, Tomb raider 2 and 3, call of duty, batman and many other games and they were running very smoothly in high graphics settings. But the battery backup is not that good you have to charge it every time after 2 hours of gaming. but in normal usage it will last upto 4 to 5 hours. So yeah if you can compromise in battery backup it will good for you and i purchased it in rs 43000 with card discount in Amazon sale so wait for any sale of Amazon if you are planning to purchase it.; I've been an Amazon Customer for a long time and have done shopping worth lakhs till now.
I had recorded video while I recieved the laptop.
As soon as I had recieved the product, I saw there was vertical yellow line on the display and I immediately raised issue with customer service to which they told me to wait for some time to get delivery status reflected in the system.
After waiting 1 day and multiple calls later, the next day I was able to raise request for laptop inspection.
No one came and I had to wait 2-3 days more.
Then I had to reschedule the laptop inspection further.
This time I recieved call from the person who asked me what the issue was and asked me the OTP for inspection. He told me my replacement will happen surely.
Then after a few days I had received the replacement product at my doorstep. The delivery agent denied me the delivery as the correct status was not showing in his system. He said it should say ""Pickup item without verification"" but it said kust ""Pickup item"" and told me to contact customer care and that the delivery will be reattempted after the status gets changed.
I was skeptical and asked him to wait till I contact the customer service but he didn't agree and he left anyways.
I've call recording of all the calls and emails for all the resolution that was provided to me.
When I called customer service first time, the response was that instructions to reattempt the delivery have been given to the delivery agent.
After few Hours I check Amazon app and find that my Package status says cancelled.
I immediately call the customer service and they tell me that it has been cancelled and there's nothing I could do about it.
I raised issue with senior and they provided resolution that delivery will be reattempted the same day itself.
After some time I got call from local station delivery person and told that it will be delivered today if not tomorrow on priority basis.
Again I waited for the whole day and at end of the day I called customer service again. Now they said that i should wait 2-3 days more. The next day I see package is returning to the seller. Again I call the customer service and they say that it's returning to seller and there's nothing that can be done.
So I asked them to transfer to senior. Explained him the whole issue. Now I am given resolution to get it refunded.
I cannot accept refund as I used credit card to purchase this laptop whose bill I've already paid. Also this laptop I had purchased was on exchange with additional exchange discounts of 5000 which will be subtracted if I return. So I will have to face 5k loss for return along with credit card refund problem.
I trust Amazon to make this expensive purchase because of the customer satisfaction but here I can clearly see I'm facing so many problems.
Latest resolution from the senior i got is that I should wait again and another replacement will be created in another 24-48 hours.
I request amazon üôèüôè please get my laptop replacement as I'm loosing lot of my money and time as the device I exchanged was my work laptop and this new laptop has display problem so for the past 10 days I'm in business loss.
Please Amazon helpüôèüôè
Edit:
After contacting Amazon several times for resolution, in the end nothing work out and had to get the display changed under warranty and now have new problem as the new screen has screen bleeding issue.; Performance is somewhat good but battery back up is really disappointed!"

This was the only one available with SATA port and reasonably recent CPU and a reasonable price. On that front, it is great.

However, I wanted to use it with Linux, and on that front I took a huge risk. Luckily, almost everything works fine on Linux. However, suspend to RAM doesn't work. To go into details, the BIOS doesn't support S3 sleep. It only supports S0x sleep, support for which is only beginning to mature in Linux. I am currently forced to use hibernate, which is slower.; Worst display quality , sound quality is also not good , customer care don't pick up the call , customer care don't response on return policy , not value for money; Superior look and light weight
AMD is always better than Intel in overall performance; I bought this laptop about 10 months ago,I have to say the laptop performance is good,great upgrade options, but have note that acer service quality is poor I live in Pune and the have only on service center,no pickup available, I didn't like the customer care as they didn't provide me with the solution,I am disappointed üòû with the brand after sale service . Literally pathatic.; It's not bad, but not good either. I bought it for 38,990. I was getting the same price for some other acer laptop with intel i5 1155g7 processor and IPS display, but I missed the deal. So, I bought this ‚òπÔ∏è.

Pros:
1- Performance is not an issue. Decent performance for most of the tasks.
2- Didn't do gaming, so not sure of that. But for programming, it's good.
3- Good for multitasking.
4- Audio is good. It's not loud, but sufficient and it comes with Nahimic audio (for which you will have to download it's app) which enhances it's audio capabilities. Audio can be optimised for different purpose.
5- Sufficient ports. Also have type C port.
6- It has control center to control fan speed, external keyboard light, manage fan speed, power.
7- Battery is decent and can last 4-5 hours on regular workload. But on heavy workload, it will last around 2-2.5 hours.
8- Lookwise it is good.
9- lifetime windows 11 home.

Cons:
1- Although display is antiglare FHD. It's not IPS, so it looks crisp but average. It's just ok for the purpose of coding or regular tasks where we just want the work to be done. Since viewing angle are bad, so for entertainment, it's good for single person for watching movies but not for multiple people. Display is not good for graphic designer who needs color accuracy.
2- There is no backlit keyboard. So, if you want backlit, connect external keyboard with backlit.
3- Although it has an SSD, I didn't find the boot time to be faster. It is fast but didn't meet my expectations.
4- Graphic card is not dedicated which is just good for normal work. I don't think you will enjoy gaming on it. It can play light games but surely you won't enjoy gaming on such system. And it won't able to play high demanding games.
5- Doesn't have activated ms office. You will have to buy it's keys.

Note:
You can install a separate harddisk (HDD) for storing data. Screws are provided with laptop.

For me, the bottom side became very hot and fans started making noise, when it first arrived and I was installing windows updates on it first used it on my bed, that is without proper ventilation. But with proper air flow, it doesn't heat.

Conclusion:
If you are limited on budget and only want your work to be done and doesn't care much about display quality or back lit keyboard or you aren't a gamer, you can buy it.
And if you already bought it, don't regret your decision. It's a ok laptop for most of the task and will get your work done.

UPDATE:- It hangs in middle, and everything stops working not even power button unless I press it for long time to force shutdown.....all my work was lost and mind you I was not doing a heavy task that it couldn't handle, simple web browsing and it stopped in middle, nothing worked....really frustrated.....

Display quality is good but speakers volume is low, like on 100% volume it's seem quite low, but it's audible. Build quality is very good and it supports fast charging.

And I'm writing this after 1 month of usage.; I've been using this laptop for a week, and first of all, it's a good laptop with clean and nice build, does not look too gaming focus (design wise). 120 hz display is quite nice, and for some reason you can't go back to 60hz (no option)
Can run games smoothly (not on the highest settings) , I played genshin, sekiro, elden ring(mid settings), apex,lol and it doesn't lag at all, so I would say its quit good for games too, (tried valorant too but my internet sucks so I can't say much but it won't lag im sure), litlle bit of frame drops, here and there but thats like once or twice in a day so it doesn't really matter, the fans do kick in quite fast, the backlit of the keyboard is static to white/purplist? The charging is quite fast, you have to charge and play games otherwise it's gonna be laggy
The bad thing I find was the speaker, it's a bit muffled, it's not that high quality, i would say its average, it's not good, it's useable some people won't find anything wrong but it's not good (could just be on my pc only)
Overall a good choice for budget gaming laptop, although I would suggest buying the Intel version, if it's for gaming, there are some frame rates difference between them but is like 5-6fps; performs really well and build quality is v good, best laptop in this price range and is value for money. temps go up to 74¬∞c max on heavy games and is really cool while gaming.; lenovo ideapad gaming 3
ryzen 5 5600h
512 ssd, 8 gb ram & 4 gb 1650 gtx

This is a beast processor and budget gaming laptop
i bought it at 48k under some offers
And in this range ....it was such a great laptop (alrounder)
pros -: great processor ryzen 5 5600h, amazing 120hz display, with white 2 level backlit keyboard, good thermal, very useful lenovo vantage app for customise setting of battery & sound & performance mode etc., simple stylish looks and design of this laptop, all ports are available, keyboad is very friendly for typing with a good size of four large arrow keys, camera quality is good enough with shutter to open & close, boot time is less than 5 sec which is really very fast and shutdown in just 2 sec. upgrade option is also available for future with another storage add of ssd or hdd and another ram upgrade upto 16 gb (extra one empty slot for ram stick)
cons -: battery above 90% in normal task ...it gives around 4 hrs and in heavy task around 3 hrs...i mean to say that it is decent battery backup from the 45wh battery. because i m not a gamer. so, this battery backup is good
conclusion -: around 50k budget this laptop is the best gaming laptop in 2022...go for this lenovo ideapad gaming 3 laptop blindly i m very happy to select this laptop.; It is very good laptop. You can play most of games in high graphics. I have played GTA 5, Tomb raider 2 and 3, call of duty, batman and many other games and they were running very smoothly in high graphics settings. But the battery backup is not that good you have to charge it every time after 2 hours of gaming. but in normal usage it will last upto 4 to 5 hours. So yeah if you can compromise in battery backup it will good for you and i purchased it in rs 43000 with card discount in Amazon sale so wait for any sale of Amazon if you are planning to purchase it.; I've been an Amazon Customer for a long time and have done shopping worth lakhs till now.
I had recorded video while I recieved the laptop.
As soon as I had recieved the product, I saw there was vertical yellow line on the display and I immediately raised issue with customer service to which they told me to wait for some time to get delivery status reflected in the system.
After waiting 1 day and multiple calls later, the next day I was able to raise request for laptop inspection.
No one came and I had to wait 2-3 days more.
Then I had to reschedule the laptop inspection further.
This time I recieved call from the person who asked me what the issue was and asked me the OTP for inspection. He told me my replacement will happen surely.
Then after a few days I had received the replacement product at my doorstep. The delivery agent denied me the delivery as the correct status was not showing in his system. He said it should say ""Pickup item without verification"" but it said kust ""Pickup item"" and told me to contact customer care and that the delivery will be reattempted after the status gets changed.
I was skeptical and asked him to wait till I contact the customer service but he didn't agree and he left anyways.
I've call recording of all the calls and emails for all the resolution that was provided to me.
When I called customer service first time, the response was that instructions to reattempt the delivery have been given to the delivery agent.
After few Hours I check Amazon app and find that my Package status says cancelled.
I immediately call the customer service and they tell me that it has been cancelled and there's nothing I could do about it.
I raised issue with senior and they provided resolution that delivery will be reattempted the same day itself.
After some time I got call from local station delivery person and told that it will be delivered today if not tomorrow on priority basis.
Again I waited for the whole day and at end of the day I called customer service again. Now they said that i should wait 2-3 days more. The next day I see package is returning to the seller. Again I call the customer service and they say that it's returning to seller and there's nothing that can be done.
So I asked them to transfer to senior. Explained him the whole issue. Now I am given resolution to get it refunded.
I cannot accept refund as I used credit card to purchase this laptop whose bill I've already paid. Also this laptop I had purchased was on exchange with additional exchange discounts of 5000 which will be subtracted if I return. So I will have to face 5k loss for return along with credit card refund problem.
I trust Amazon to make this expensive purchase because of the customer satisfaction but here I can clearly see I'm facing so many problems.
Latest resolution from the senior i got is that I should wait again and another replacement will be created in another 24-48 hours.
I request amazon üôèüôè please get my laptop replacement as I'm loosing lot of my money and time as the device I exchanged was my work laptop and this new laptop has display problem so for the past 10 days I'm in business loss.
Please Amazon helpüôèüôè

This was the only one available with SATA port and reasonably recent CPU and a reasonable price. On that front, it is great.

However, I wanted to use it with Linux, and on that front I took a huge risk. Luckily, almost everything works fine on Linux. However, suspend to RAM doesn't work. To go into details, the BIOS doesn't support S3 sleep. It only supports S0x sleep, support for which is only beginning to mature in Linux. I am currently forced to use hibernate, which is slower.; Worst display quality , sound quality is also not good , customer care don't pick up the call , customer care don't response on return policy , not value for money; Superior look and light weight
AMD is always better than Intel in overall performance; I bought this laptop about 10 months ago,I have to say the laptop performance is good,great upgrade options, but have note that acer service quality is poor I live in Pune and the have only on service center,no pickup available, I didn't like the customer care as they didn't provide me with the solution,I am disappointed üòû with the brand after sale service . Literally pathatic.; It's not bad, but not good either. I bought it for 38,990. I was getting the same price for some other acer laptop with intel i5 1155g7 processor and IPS display, but I missed the deal. So, I bought this ‚òπÔ∏è.

Pros:
1- Performance is not an issue. Decent performance for most of the tasks.
2- Didn't do gaming, so not sure of that. But for programming, it's good.
3- Good for multitasking.
4- Audio is good. It's not loud, but sufficient and it comes with Nahimic audio (for which you will have to download it's app) which enhances it's audio capabilities. Audio can be optimised for different purpose.
5- Sufficient ports. Also have type C port.
6- It has control center to control fan speed, external keyboard light, manage fan speed, power.
7- Battery is decent and can last 4-5 hours on regular workload. But on heavy workload, it will last around 2-2.5 hours.
8- Lookwise it is good.
9- lifetime windows 11 home.

Cons:
1- Although display is antiglare FHD. It's not IPS, so it looks crisp but average. It's just ok for the purpose of coding or regular tasks where we just want the work to be done. Since viewing angle are bad, so for entertainment, it's good for single person for watching movies but not for multiple people. Display is not good for graphic designer who needs color accuracy.
2- There is no backlit keyboard. So, if you want backlit, connect external keyboard with backlit.
3- Although it has an SSD, I didn't find the boot time to be faster. It is fast but didn't meet my expectations.
4- Graphic card is not dedicated which is just good for normal work. I don't think you will enjoy gaming on it. It can play light games but surely you won't enjoy gaming on such system. And it won't able to play high demanding games.
5- Doesn't have activated ms office. You will have to buy it's keys.

Note:
You can install a separate harddisk (HDD) for storing data. Screws are provided with laptop.

For me, the bottom side became very hot and fans started making noise, when it first arrived and I was installing windows updates on it first used it on my bed, that is without proper ventilation. But with proper air flow, it doesn't heat.

Conclusion:
If you are limited on budget and only want your work to be done and doesn't care much about display quality or back lit keyboard or you aren't a gamer, you can buy it.
And if you already bought it, don't regret your decision. It's a ok laptop for most of the task and will get your work done.

UPDATE:- It hangs in middle, and everything stops working not even power button unless I press it for long time to force shutdown.....all my work was lost and mind you I was not doing a heavy task that it couldn't handle, simple web browsing and it stopped in middle, nothing worked....really frustrated..... Don't know if it was windows 11 issue or due to cheap hardware of this machine,ü•πüò°; nice laptop for the price paid...got good exchange price also for old laptop.."

Review after 1 month of use:

Processor:
-Ryzen 7530U is a best processor clubbed with 16GB RAM is very good for programming or running heavy applications.

Keyboard:
-I am not quite happy with the new keyboard in Gen 5 as compared to older gen. Lenovo says its more tactile but i feel it moved more towards chicket one which is not what a thinkpad user likes.

Webcam:
- Webcam could have been better. If there is a even a small light source opp. to the camera, images get very blur. In proper lighting it ok to use, but better to have a seperate webcam if your work requires frequent calls.

Battery:
- Battery backup is good for a window laptop. With Balanced setting it can easily last for 6-7 hours. Company claims 12 hrs which i feel is not possible and just a gimmick.

Display:
- Anti Glare screen is just amazing. you will love this if you are a developer and casual OTT consumer. However this is a IPS panel which i feel is the biggest upgrade from older gen thinkpads at this price range, but max brightness is slightly on the lower side of 250 nits. I may be feeling this slightly more i as i used Macbook Air M1 which has around 400 nits with retina display. Since this being built for professional use, i wouldn't recommend this for graphic designing or photoshop due to low colour accuracy in the display

Ports:
Having 2 USB Type C port in Gen 5 is a great plus. You get 2 high speed type a as well. Having Lan and HDMI port is a great relief compared to my Mac

Win 11 & Office:

Also, every time the reason mentioned was pickup refused by customer which is totally false. If I was contacted I need proof of the same.

I need to travel tomorrow and it will be such a big issue for me now.My work is suffering so much. The customer care people are also not responding. It has been a horrendous experience.; The photo in display and the video shows the laptop to have a USB C port. The product that i received only has the USB 2 ports...NO USB C port (could be just an oversight or error by the seller). It's just a day since it arrived, no complaints as such yet. Looks like a laptop worth it's money.; Not so good product; The laptop has a heating issue, and the screen display is not satisfactory. It may be considered as an economical laptop from Dell from the heating is not expected from such a brand.; ; laptop Performance is Ok , especially availability of genuine windows and MS office Home edition along with bunch of other software preloaded. only you have to partition the SSD into local drives at your end to keep Program files in C drive . Otherwise it is Fast , better performance in 12th generation i3 processor from 11th generation i5.
Heating issue is there in all dell laptops including this one, so i will wait for next 2-3 months to check whether this heating issue creates any problem in performance of laptop in summers.
Dell shall arrange to direct blowers not towards the screen as in present case , in my opinion the the heat coming from blowers towards the screen may reduce or impact Screen due to heat blow. Laptop also heats from below , so i don't think it is advisable to keep it on lap ( legs) , better to operate on table or some platform.; Dislike:
USB Type C port is not there, however the product images and videos claim there is one Type C port.
Sad, Misleading claim.

not even boot and says ""Network media not available"". Also it does not allow replacement (even thought it said ""eligible for replacement till April 15""). Not much help from Amazon Chat either. Overall stuck with a faulty product. Bad experience.i want my refund. I continue to call Amazon but they even not helping me.
Do not buy same model; Good product ...; Good and awesome product good looking üòÑ; See the laptop is very good in performance as it has one major issue with BATTERY üîã, it gives backup of only 3hr in full capacity, not more than that, use some battery saving features and options in laptop after purchasing it.

I have to bought this laptop as it has all features in 32,433/- rupees as i got aware about the problem with battery, use Lenovo Vanced.; Good Laptop; Ordered on 12th Jan 2024 I got the laptop on 13th jan 2024,
I was not at home I have come home by 9:00 pm
Opened the laptop and the this screen has come can‚Äôt operate since 3 days
Amazon customer support says that the Lenovo brand will first inspect then they will decide that it will replace or repair
Refund will be last options. Since the 13 jan no one is came from the Lenovo brand to inspect the laptop
This is not good service by Amazon and Lenovo; Os was not installed"

Asking customer to pay for fixing faulty piece delivered to me is heights!! Just terrible and pathetic. Don‚Äôt buy this unreliable laptop and from HP.

Very worst experience in HP , Not responding at for customer support, this company not reliable at all.
Please don't fall on HP brand be careful.; I have already used a laptop another brand for last two years but this laptop is the best laptop I have ever used.

Quality of the product is also really great, it will be slightly on the heavier side but its a gaming laptop so no issues. Appearance is classy and RGB lighting is rare in this price.
Display is just like any other display in this price range. It can play 4k videos on YouTube so no issues.
Only downside of this laptop at this moment for me is its battery, with i gpu only mode and performance mode turned on, backlight turned off and brightness set to 50 percentage the battery will last for 3 to 5 hours according to you, but remember this is a windows gaming laptop with 85 w tgp rtx 3050 so the battery backup is not bad.Also you will only use a gaming laptop by plugging in. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GAMING LAPTOP THEN GO FOR IT, IF YOU WANT A LAPTOP WITH HIGH BATTERY LIFE THEN LOOK SOMETHING ELSE, ALTHOUGH I PREFER THIS LAPTOP. NO OTHER ISSUES WITHIN 3 DAYS OF PURCHASE, IF SOMETHING HAPPENS I WILL EDIT MY REVIEW; Seriously, do not even think about buying this laptop. It's just not worth it. Worst laptop. Slow, Over heat, Low screen brightness and many problems. Save yourself the trouble and find something better. I bought at 50k 16gb laptop with card during sale days. i wonder why this much low priice offering now after delivered i get to know its worst laptop.; ; Best gaming laptop compared to upto 80k laptops.
I bought it for 62990.
But in summer sale it is for as low as 55400.
Pros: Antiglare Display and Performance this combination of CPU and GPU can only be seen in 80-90k laptops.
Note: battery lasts for around 2-3 hours in Normal use and 1 hour while gaming. See it's already insisted to use laptop plugged in while gaming, so don't mind battery, since it has 4 cooling fans and they require power.; I bought this laptop for 57k after Bank Discount and this Laptop Is Amazing. Its display is also nice and giving a good quality Go for It i you are looking for a laptop in this range its value for money sound Quality is good but i would prefer using headphones while gaming on it and the batter is also good i have been playing gta v for straight 4 hours on it and it didn't even lag a bit Its Amazing laptop; bought it at 57k , honestly its a goddam steal; ; "

The video quality is superb.
The heating problem is there.
Not compatible gaming as some of the game expected hardware is not available.
I am a music lover, so I was expecting the sound quality to be better as laptop loaded with 2W speakers.
The battery backup is good.; The Ideapad Slim 5, is a high-quality laptop, perfect for office use. It boasts excellent features, including i5, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. The speed is impressive, making it a strong recommendation for anyone in need of a reliable work companion.; Pros
Good build quality
Anti Glare works fine
Display is good
Charging is fast enough
Keyboard is very good
Backlight keys are well illuminated
Performance is good
Cons
Battery last 3 hrs at 65% brightness
Heating with normal usages
Heating on charging even in switched off
Display brightness is ok but it feels low sometimes.
No RJ45 connector; First of all thanks to Amazon for the fastest deliveries less than 24 hours with good shape.
Now on the laptop front superb finish love at first sight, it is a clean laptop with all the essential features. Top lid is of metal a premium quality laptop with precise cut at each and every corner. It is a 12th Generation i5 - 12450H processor laptop due to which no issues at the processing of task no matter what you give, it run as a breeze, no fingerprint sensor, no graphics card it had a internal graphics card which is terrible if you want this laptop for gaming purpose then do not purchase this. I have purchased this as i have no use of graphics card.

Pros:

ASPECT RATIO: 16:10 ( Major highlight which is helpful in Coding )
SCREEN : IPS Panel with 60Hz resolution with good viewing angle.
CHARGER: 65 Watt Charger with USB type C
FRONT CAM: 720p with privacy shutter.
SSD: 500 GB (with upgradable option)
TRACK PAD : Very nice wide and smooth scroll with good tactile feedback.
BACKLITE KEYBOARD : YES

Cons:

RAM: 16 GB ( not upgradable this is a major downside of this laptop which is so expensive)
HDD: ( no slot for HDD )
FINGERPRINT : NO
GRAPHICS CARD: Inbuilt

HEATING ISSUE:

Most important due to which I gave it a less rating since Lenovo knows it is a H series processor therefore vents should be cut out at the side end of the laptop but at present the vent is at the screen & bottom end due to which when performing high priority tasks it becomes hot as it is clocked at base 2.0 Ghz the keyboard area becomes hot and due to vents placed at screen side screen & metal lid becomes hot not that much hot but still a premium laptop Ideapad 5 series should not have this kind of issues. During benchmark test the keyboard area becomes serious hot and the screen area the right bottom area becomes hot due to vent throwing air at the screen.; Pros:
Look is amazing
16 GB ram is good enough for advanced multitasking
Light weight

Cons:
No FPR; Battery drainage issue üò≠. I have High expectations on this. Literally so frustrated.
When we are on meetings when we turn on camera falsh light automatically turns on and no option to turn it off . So frustrating we can't concentrate on anything else if it keep disturbing our eyes.

It also offers a fingerprint scanner which is a very good thing in a budget laptop.

1. OLED Screen: Awesome screen. True to life media consumption.
2. Processor: 12th gen U category i3 processor. Battery efficient and powerful processor.
3. Ram : 16gb upgradable. More than enough ram for work ,productivity and games as well.
4. 90hz screen so very smooth experience

Cons
1. Battery last for 4-5 hours on normal usage.
2. Plastic built so use carefully.
3. Camera is 720p so not good for a lot of meetings.; According to the budget you get really good laptop. Considering the price it is value for money.
Pros:
1) The display is top notch feeling viewing angles are really good that will never disappoint you
2) it has decent battery capacity considering the high resolution screen it is giving me around 4.5hrs approximately
3) Processor and user interface is really fluid combined with that 90hz .....it is very good for day to day usages
Cons :
1) If you want a laptop with atleast mediocre sound quality this is not for you because the sound it produces is very very low you can't even hear to any songs or movies
2) so if you are willing to sacrifice the sound just for high resolution screen just go head if not just choose any other brand
People who loves sound just don't buy this one you can't even hear single thing from it
(For Sound ..........it is just waste of money don't buy I repeat don't even consider this laptop go for better sound producing laptops ); Laptop is sleek with good performance.
Everything is good but there's been heating issue while charging and using it at the same time. Battery backup is average.; I bought this product in Jan 2024, overall it's decent laptop in this price (for me 42k). I'm moderate user, not use any heavy software. My previous device was quite old (2014), so for me this one is really fast. It boots quickly and apps load in no time e.g. Gimp, Chrome.
Battery life is around 5 hours with internet.
Camera quality can be improved.
In 4 months usage I haven't faced any issues so far.; It's a good laptop with average display. The Wifi/Bluetooth modules doesn't work with Linux. Battery runs about 4 Hrs of normal browsing and multimedia playback.

I've been using this laptop for just 2 days and have only tested one game(God of War 2018) at the time of writing this review.
Pros:1. It is one of the most affordable rtx 3050 laptops. Most laptops at this price range come with gtx 1650 cards. RTX cards have DLSS support, which greatly boosts FPS and enhances gaming experience.
2. Good built and design. I personally love the minimalistic design language of this laptop. There is no screen wobbling, and the typing experience isn't bad either.
Cons: 1.This laptop comes with 16 gb ram, but there is only one ram slot, so there is no room for a future upgrade. Also a missed opportunity for dual channel ram.
2. Below average battery life, but it isn't much of an issue for me because I always use my laptop plugged in for better performance and gaming.
3. Only two USB ports while the competition gives at least 3 ports.
All in all, this is still a good choice in its price segment despite its flaws.; The only reason I'm giving this 4 star is it's battery backup. Not a good battery. Rest this is good to have laptop; It easily runs all games and softwares you throw at it and gives 120+fps in most AAA titles.the build quality is plastic but still pretty great. Thermals are amazing too and the GPU doesn't go over 65C¬∞. Overall amazing product
Charging is pretty fast it goes from 0 to 50 in 30mins.Appearcence is pretty elegant and not gaming themed.It has blue highlights in vents.; It's a very good laptop. The screen, processing, display, keyboard, all perfect for my work. If your work includes multitasking and working on multiple applications/software, this one may fulfil your requirements.

But do note that it's NOT that portable, it's on the heavier side and may be difficult to carry if your work needs moving around or travelling.

Battery life is very average kinds, given it's gaming laptop. With my work (involves running 1-2 processor heavy software and multiple browser windows with real-time data updates) I get max around 3-3.5 hrs backup.

Connectivity is good, wifi 6 gives pretty good speed, ports are good enough to connect multiple things for work.

Didn't use it for gaming, so cannot comment on that.

Regarding McAfee which comes pre-installed. Don't use it, it makes this machine with 16 GB ram and 512 GB SSD feel like an old laptop from 2003-4 with 40gb hdd and 256 MB ram. Initially I thought there's some problem with laptop, but after uninstalling McAfee, it's working fine.; Very good for the price.; It's a good laptop for the price. 83GS003UIN check with this model specs in Lenovo website before buying. If it meets your needs then buy. It doesn't mention RGB keyboard in Lenovo website. But amazon description is misleading.

Pros:
Expected performance for the price with 3050.

Good screen(bright enough 300 nits) & colors .
Linux support seems good. Although most of the lenovo software isn't available for it.

Thermals seem good.

I was able to run genshin at high graphics and record at the same time without hiccups.

Good port selection for my needs

Automatically switches between dedicated graphics and Nvidia optimus.

Cons:
Speaker is trash.
Battery backup is trash.
An AMD CPU would have been better
You can still expect some frame drops occassionally for heavy games.
Windows 11 setup was trash as always. I had to reinstall it.

I use an external keyboard and headphone. So I don't really have issues with the non RGB keyboard and the sound quality.

I'll say it's good for most people if you want a gaming laptop that runs good enough for most needs and has a good screen to look at.; Overall performance was good but battery sucks .; Amazon is cheating there is No RGB Lights in Keyboard.

The key reasons for choosing this laptop are:

1. Good Brand - HP
2. Decent Processor (Intel Core i5), intel iRISx Graphics, and 16GB DDR 4
3. Easy to carry around - 14"", Light Weight
4. Backlit, Good Looks, Finger Sensor, ....

Since Purchase:

1. Easy to setup
2. Windows 11 Home, Office 2021 (life time validity)
3. Super fast
4. Excellent display with warm color setting to block off the blue light
5. Fast charging

Very happy with my purchase ...; Writing this review after one month of usage.

Pros :

- Performance is pretty good thanks to 12th gen intel i5.
- 16gb ram can handle multiple tasks together easily.
- iRIS Xe graphics is capable for regular graphics related tasks and games like GTA 5, fortnite runs smoothly with default graphics settings.
- Fast & Responsive Fingerprint Sensor.
- Build Quality is awesome and Hinge is better than other brand laptops.
- It can handle Android Studio, VS code, Emulators and virtual machines along with multiple chrome tabs.

Cons :

- Heating issue when playing games. and can't change FAN speed through any HP utility program.
- Battery Life could be improved. but you'll get enough battery life for regular tasks and browsing, media etc.
- No Smart Charging support even after updating BIOS.; it has been 10-15days and laptop is working fine. I am mostly using it for lightweight coding and reading purpose.
battery backup is actually ok , around 4-5 hrs with above workload.
sound is ok too not that great but I expected that already.

what i really liked is the classic keyboard layout no wierd surprises and with good backlight
fingerprint works fine.

Microsoft suite was provided on registration which popped up sometime after booting first time.; Laptop is very good, received bin good condition, meet my expectation, worth for money.; I have been using this product for more than one month now. Speed & low weight is a positive. However, the laptop switches off or hangs on its own even if slightly moved while working. It keeps on losing battery very quickly even if its shut (not shut down) and becomes hot while doing so. The performance is much below satisfactory; This is my first Laptop purchased on any Online portal.
Delivery was good and packaging was sturdy.
This is compact light weight and does everything.
Sound quality is excellent,
Screen is very good. Battery backup is 4-5 hours with moderate activity.
You don't need any service to setup this Laptop, if you can read simple English and willing to spare some time, it will be over within 30 minutes.
Even Warranty registration for Office is quick and easy.
Overall, no issues found.
Highly recommend this HP Laptop.; Battery backup is not up to the mark. Company offers 8 hours backup. But this new laptop gives hardly 2 to 3 hours only. Else everything working fine; An excellent product with good UI."

Good screen, great design, feels expensive for the price, good price to performance ratio. It offers a new 16:10 aspect ratio in the mass market of boring laptops, build quality is way better than Lenovo and Dell.

Dislike :

It comes with Windows 11, Has only 1 Ssd slot.

Some points to clear confusion:

1. There's 1 free Ram slot on 8 Gb model (8gb is Soldered on Motherboard) which can accommodate a 16 Gb stick making it a total of 24 Gb Ram for future.
* There's no free Ram slot in 16 Gb model (8 Gb is soldered on the motherboard and there's a 8gb stick in the Ram slot, so when it comes to upgrade the Ram, you'll have to replace the 8 Gb with a 16 Gb stick and your original 8 Gb will be wasted.

2. There's only 1 SSD slot which is preoccupied with the 512 Gb ssd. You can upgrade the ssd (technically replace the current one) upto 2 TB.

3. The brightness of the screen is way better than your average Lenovo, Dell laptops. The colors are crisp and display looks great while consuming content and browsing the Internet.

4. WiFi & Bluetooth works like a charm.

5. TouchPad is good and spacious and the fingerprint reader is fast too.

6. The camera shutter is a blessing in disguise.

7. The battery backup is decent, I got around 8 hours when I was working with WiFi on and around 10 hours when I was watching TV series with WiFi off.
*The screen brightness was at 40% with wired earphones.

If you're someone who doesn't do hardcore gaming, needs a laptop that will help you with your work, media consumption and casual gaming, then this is your laptop.

I hope this helps.; this is one of the perfect machine the onely cons is that the sound quality is less and everything is peak; 1} the battery life is good
2]performance is top notch
3] the packaging is ok because no air bags were placed inside or to the side of the laptop box instead you are paying so much money. i was really worried after placing an online order.
4}if you are thinking of buying the Ryzen 7 5800H series then just go for it , as the discount applied by amazon truly gives the right product.
5}from this seller i am really impressed by the the genuine product they have given.
6} i am really disappointed by the delivery boy through which they have delivered the behaviour is very bad .
7] the set up for the laptop was quite easy no needed for additional set up from amazon.
8}over all the processor, the ram the variant is amazing . i would recommend this laptop to everyone as it has a lot of additional features like backlit keyboard in dark is pretty good , the sound quality of the audio box is very good while playing any music or movie or video.; The performance is good for the price range .. battery is also good.. but display is decent; Nice design with silver color, light weight, ryzen 7 processor can handle multiple process at same time easily. speakers volume loudness is bit low, battery time around 5 hour with moderate level use"

I asked for replacement, they said replacement wasn't available, it had to be returned. They did not pickup despite scheduling the pickup up twice. Also, every time the reason mentioned was pickup refused by customer which is totally false. If I was contacted I need proof of the same.

I need to travel tomorrow and it will be such a big issue for me now.My work is suffering so much. The customer care people are also not responding. It has been a horrendous experience.; The photo in display and the video shows the laptop to have a USB C port. The product that i received only has the USB 2 ports...NO USB C port (could be just an oversight or error by the seller). It's just a day since it arrived, no complaints as such yet. Looks like a laptop worth it's money.; Not so good product; The laptop has a heating issue, and the screen display is not satisfactory. It may be considered as an economical laptop from Dell from the heating is not expected from such a brand.; ; laptop Performance is Ok , especially availability of genuine windows and MS office Home edition along with bunch of other software preloaded. only you have to partition the SSD into local drives at your end to keep Program files in C drive . Otherwise it is Fast , better performance in 12th generation i3 processor from 11th generation i5.
Heating issue is there in all dell laptops including this one, so i will wait for next 2-3 months to check whether this heating issue creates any problem in performance of laptop in summers.
Dell shall arrange to direct blowers not towards the screen as in present case , in my opinion the the heat coming from blowers towards the screen may reduce or impact Screen due to heat blow. Laptop also heats from below , so i don't think it is advisable to keep it on lap ( legs) , better to operate on table or some platform.; Dislike:
USB Type C port is not there, however the product images and videos claim there is one Type C port.
Sad, Misleading claim.
Like:
Light Weight.; Worth ful for 35k
Lite use

This was the only one available with SATA port and reasonably recent CPU and a reasonable price. On that front, it is great.

However, I wanted to use it with Linux, and on that front I took a huge risk. Luckily, almost everything works fine on Linux. However, suspend to RAM doesn't work. To go into details, the BIOS doesn't support S3 sleep. It only supports S0x sleep, support for which is only beginning to mature in Linux. I am currently forced to use hibernate, which is slower.; Worst display quality , sound quality is also not good , customer care don't pick up the call , customer care don't response on return policy , not value for money; Superior look and light weight
AMD is always better than Intel in overall performance; I bought this laptop about 10 months ago,I have to say the laptop performance is good,great upgrade options, but have note that acer service quality is poor I live in Pune and the have only on service center,no pickup available, I didn't like the customer care as they didn't provide me with the solution,I am disappointed üòû with the brand after sale service . Literally pathatic.; It's not bad, but not good either. I bought it for 38,990. I was getting the same price for some other acer laptop with intel i5 1155g7 processor and IPS display, but I missed the deal. So, I bought this ‚òπÔ∏è.

Pros:
1- Performance is not an issue. Decent performance for most of the tasks.
2- Didn't do gaming, so not sure of that. But for programming, it's good.
3- Good for multitasking.
4- Audio is good. It's not loud, but sufficient and it comes with Nahimic audio (for which you will have to download it's app) which enhances it's audio capabilities. Audio can be optimised for different purpose.
5- Sufficient ports. Also have type C port.
6- It has control center to control fan speed, external keyboard light, manage fan speed, power.
7- Battery is decent and can last 4-5 hours on regular workload. But on heavy workload, it will last around 2-2.5 hours.
8- Lookwise it is good.
9- lifetime windows 11 home.

Cons:
1- Although display is antiglare FHD. It's not IPS, so it looks crisp but average. It's just ok for the purpose of coding or regular tasks where we just want the work to be done. Since viewing angle are bad, so for entertainment, it's good for single person for watching movies but not for multiple people. Display is not good for graphic designer who needs color accuracy.
2- There is no backlit keyboard. So, if you want backlit, connect external keyboard with backlit.
3- Although it has an SSD, I didn't find the boot time to be faster. It is fast but didn't meet my expectations.
4- Graphic card is not dedicated which is just good for normal work. I don't think you will enjoy gaming on it. It can play light games but surely you won't enjoy gaming on such system. And it won't able to play high demanding games.
5- Doesn't have activated ms office. You will have to buy it's keys.

Note:
You can install a separate harddisk (HDD) for storing data. Screws are provided with laptop.

For me, the bottom side became very hot and fans started making noise, when it first arrived and I was installing windows updates on it first used it on my bed, that is without proper ventilation. But with proper air flow, it doesn't heat.

Conclusion:
If you are limited on budget and only want your work to be done and doesn't care much about display quality or back lit keyboard or you aren't a gamer, you can buy it.
And if you already bought it, don't regret your decision. It's a ok laptop for most of the task and will get your work done.

UPDATE:- It hangs in middle, and everything stops working not even power button unless I press it for long time to force shutdown.....all my work was lost and mind you I was not doing a heavy task that it couldn't handle, simple web browsing and it stopped in middle, nothing worked....really frustrated..... Don't know if it was windows 11 issue or due to cheap hardware of this machine,ü•πüò°; nice laptop for the price paid...got good exchange price also for old laptop.."

But needs Improvement. The USB slots need to be increased. The screen size can be a bit more. The RAM should be increased for better performance. The battery life is somewhat low. Lasts only above 3 hours. This should atleast be 5 hours.; I got this laptop during the first covid lockdown. As Software engineer, I had to go for good specs and so far it is delivering on that front. Build quality is bit lower as compared to some of top brands like HP, Dell etc. But as far specifications in the price range, its value for money; I'm thoroughly disappointed with this Lenovo laptop. The build quality is incredibly poor, giving the laptop a cheap and flimsy feel. The front camera's low quality makes video calls a struggle, while the battery life is shockingly short, barely lasting a couple of hours even with minimal use. What's worse, the laptop heats up rapidly, making it uncomfortable to use.

When I reached out to Lenovo's technical support about the battery issue, their response was unsatisfactory, showing a lack of concern for the problem. A Brand technician suggested returning the item, but things took a bizarre and shocking turn when he told Amazon that he had already visited us and examined the laptop, which was then found to be in good working order. This level of deception has eroded my trust in the brand.

Overall, this laptop's poor build, subpar camera, dreadful battery life, and questionable customer service have left me regretting my purchase. I strongly advise against considering this model; it's been nothing but a series of frustrations and disappointment.; Good quality; My first 4 days of review:

I am a pro programmer (not a gamer) and laptop usage is heavy, so this meets my requirements.

i7 processor - Works wonders for me and fast processing (5/5)

Laptop build - Ok for this price. The top Lid is a concern as it is prone to scratches and fingerprints as kids have tendency to touch laptop again and again. Plastic body makes it more delicate. (4/5)

Keyboard - Works smooth and is good. Its just that I am using numpad keyboard after a decade so trying to learn how to use it. (5/5)

Screen display - Its is good and watching any youtube or netflix movie is a good experience. Slight glare problem is manageable. (4/5)

Battery Life - This is a bit of concern despite high battery life claims by Lenovo. Battery after full charge will discharge quickly so we have to be a bit careful on what you are doing on it. (3/5)

Charger - The charger tends to be a bit loose when connected to the main supply. Charger got overheated within few mins of charging so I kept on checking for it and had to switch off at times. Wire length is not good as it is only for desktop charging when laptop is just next to it. Might have to purchase a better one. (2/5)

Overall Review: 4/5 as it is still superior in performance compared to my previous laptops used. Lenovo could have improved on battery life and charger at this price.; 2 years warranty mentioned. but i received 1 year only. Kindly explain.; I don't like
Battery is lasts for 4-5 hours
Sound quality is poor
Camara is waste
Heating heavily after working for 30 min
Laptop quality is very bad,if you use you get experience the sound like hollow type or something
Cheap quality material used

Brightness is average

Great for students and working professionals with normal to medium level usage.
All in all it's a great product!; I had received the product on 5 Oct and found that power button not working on same day. Amazon promised inspection by agent in 48 hours, but the inspection happened only on 11 Oct that is 6 days. After the service engineer verified that the system is faulty, Amazon said they are to arrange a pick up in next 48 hours, that is by 13th. Today is 18th end of day, nobody has picked up despite repeated intimation. Now, I can't talk to Amazon helpline also, presumably they have blocked my number (?). So now I am stuck with a defective product, money held up with hostile Amazon. BTW, most service agents who attend calls in the day time are rude as well. I suppose the combination of this vendor and Amazon does not work well.; Laptop is not upto my expectations with display, sound and usability.; It's working good. Looks cool and functioning well üíØ. Good one. But i feel like battery life is somewhat a issue; This is a good product for my requirement. I do a music production and a little bit of coding.

Performance is good as per specifications
Best value for money
FHD display is awesome
There is disappointment in sound when compared to other laptop
But I am satisfied in sound

Over all best laptop under 50k; i bought 2nd laptop i7 12th gen. best quality and performance fast and surfing speed also fast. excellent product.; Good Configuration. Battery backup is average. Audio is not satisfactory.; MSI brand value - seems good build quality though plastic body

Poor battery as new laptop show only 2 hr battery backup ( because of low battery spec)

Poor audio- speaker not up to mark - cannot be used for meeting or for watching movie or YouTube. One have to use external speaker or headphone

Screen size is very small- yes I agree it's 14 inch laptop buy very small screen as compared to other 14 inch laptop. My 14 inch Mac has much bigger screen then them. I guess when they say 14 inch then they donot mean actual screen size; Appearance is good, mat finish, sound quality is ok ok,; I bought this in feb '24, the performance is good, I have multiple tabs open and work daily without any issues, I even sometimes render 4k videos for my yt channel too,sure gets hot in summer but else all well. MSI is a great brand; After a few weeks of usage, I can safely say that it's got good performance, decent battery life and is able to handle heavy workload easily. It's excellent value for money at below 50,000 rupees.; Charging is Good . Quality good , Display Good value is good also smooth ness but Sound quality is bad quality"

I am so much happy to get this type of gadget from Samsung.
Battery is good.
Camera quality is also good.; The laptop is decent. But compared to my old MacBook Air, it is quite heavy. Doesn't feel like a light laptop.

Also, because of metal body, it warms up very quickly. If it was a plastic body like other brands, you wouldn't feel the heat.

The laptop box I received had already seal broken, so I am not sure if I got a returned or refurbished product. Disappointed because of this, but there is no evidence of prior use.

Overall, it's fine. Been using it for 2 days. Fingerprint unlock is a nice feature. Screen is okay, some light bleed. Should have been an OLED screen for this much money.

For Rs 65k, it is expensive. Overpriced for a average performance laptop.

If anyone can get this for around 50k-55k during one of the great sales, it would be an awesome deal.; I've been using the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Core i7 13th Gen for a while now, and I can't help but share my thoughts on this impressive machine. This laptop has been a game-changer for me, and here's why:

Performance: This laptop is a powerhouse. It handles everything I throw at it with ease. Whether I'm working on multiple tasks, editing photos, or enjoying some light gaming, the Core i7 processor handles it all without breaking a sweat. It's like having a reliable workhorse at my fingertips.

Build Quality: The build quality is top-notch. It feels sturdy and well-crafted. I love the sleek design, and it's surprisingly lightweight, making it easy to carry around. The backlit keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the touchpad is responsive.

Screen Display: The screen is a real showstopper. The colors are vibrant, and the display technology is a significant improvement. Whether I'm watching movies or working on detailed projects, the screen is a pleasure to look at. It's also great for outdoor use, thanks to its high brightness & anti-glare screen.

In summary, the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Core i7 13th Gen has exceeded my expectations. It's a reliable companion for both work and play. If you're looking for a laptop that offers outstanding performance, durability, and a stunning display, this is a fantastic choice. I highly recommend it!; Laptop performance is fine.
Display is very nice.
Initially I felt sound very low..after enabling dolby atmos, sound is fine.; Just 2 months of purchase nd this happens

And now am just looking / searching here and there for a Samsung service centre

Bad quality product; Everything is good but the speaker quality is very bad; Well Writing This After Using It For 3Days
First I want to say The Samsung Again Proved Who Is The Boss..

Pro's
Display The Highlighting FACTOR 5/5üî•
Build Quality,Highly Premium 5/5üî•
Light Weight,And Littrely Too Slimüî•
Performance:Best In the business 5/5üî•

Con's
Sound Quality+Clarity Was Too Good
But Not Louder 3/5
Little Heating Issue Which Is Obvious But Not That Much Seriously..
Battery With High Performance Max 4Hours
For Just Watching Movie Upto 8Hours‚ö°

Conclusion:I Got It For 60K After Applying All The Offers, So For Me It's Simply The Great Value For Money.. If You Are A Premium Professional Person,
Then You Can Blindly Go With This..
If You Know Who Is the real Competitor of
IOS & Mac....üòå; The build quality of the product is extremely poor. The screen is pasted to a panel that comes off within a few months (I bought in Nov-2023, and am posting review in May-2024). Samsung calls this wear tear / physical damage and doesn't cover it under warranty. Service engineer will give you an estimate of Rs10K. Attached pictures give you an idea of the state of my laptop in 6 months despite extremely careful handling!

This isn't exactly a cheap laptop. Better to either:
a) buy a cheap Chinese brand and save money since the Samsung warranty is meaningless
b) Put some extra money and buy an Apple - Atleast you get the quality you pay for!"

The video quality is superb.
The heating problem is there.
Not compatible gaming as some of the game expected hardware is not available.
I am a music lover, so I was expecting the sound quality to be better as laptop loaded with 2W speakers.
The battery backup is good.; The Ideapad Slim 5, is a high-quality laptop, perfect for office use. It boasts excellent features, including i5, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. The speed is impressive, making it a strong recommendation for anyone in need of a reliable work companion.; Pros
Good build quality
Anti Glare works fine
Display is good
Charging is fast enough
Keyboard is very good
Backlight keys are well illuminated
Performance is good
Cons
Battery last 3 hrs at 65% brightness
Heating with normal usages
Heating on charging even in switched off
Display brightness is ok but it feels low sometimes.
No RJ45 connector; First of all thanks to Amazon for the fastest deliveries less than 24 hours with good shape.
Now on the laptop front superb finish love at first sight, it is a clean laptop with all the essential features. Top lid is of metal a premium quality laptop with precise cut at each and every corner. It is a 12th Generation i5 - 12450H processor laptop due to which no issues at the processing of task no matter what you give, it run as a breeze, no fingerprint sensor, no graphics card it had a internal graphics card which is terrible if you want this laptop for gaming purpose then do not purchase this. I have purchased this as i have no use of graphics card.

Pros:

ASPECT RATIO: 16:10 ( Major highlight which is helpful in Coding )
SCREEN : IPS Panel with 60Hz resolution with good viewing angle.
CHARGER: 65 Watt Charger with USB type C
FRONT CAM: 720p with privacy shutter.
SSD: 500 GB (with upgradable option)
TRACK PAD : Very nice wide and smooth scroll with good tactile feedback.
BACKLITE KEYBOARD : YES

Cons:

RAM: 16 GB ( not upgradable this is a major downside of this laptop which is so expensive)
HDD: ( no slot for HDD )
FINGERPRINT : NO
GRAPHICS CARD: Inbuilt

HEATING ISSUE:

Most important due to which I gave it a less rating since Lenovo knows it is a H series processor therefore vents should be cut out at the side end of the laptop but at present the vent is at the screen & bottom end due to which when performing high priority tasks it becomes hot as it is clocked at base 2.0 Ghz the keyboard area becomes hot and due to vents placed at screen side screen & metal lid becomes hot not that much hot but still a premium laptop Ideapad 5 series should not have this kind of issues. During benchmark test the keyboard area becomes serious hot and the screen area the right bottom area becomes hot due to vent throwing air at the screen.; Pros:
Look is amazing
16 GB ram is good enough for advanced multitasking
Light weight

Cons:
No FPR; Battery drainage issue üò≠. I have High expectations on this. Literally so frustrated.
When we are on meetings when we turn on camera falsh light automatically turns on and no option to turn it off . So frustrating we can't concentrate on anything else if it keep disturbing our eyes.

I literally don't like that flash when we use camera

Expect these everything is fine; Good product"

Speaker sound is very low.

Battery backup also not good.

Not worth for money.; What to say, its really nice product , the only thing I don't like is that its not metal body.. Rest everything is good.; Build quality issue; Let's be honest the quality of laptop is better than i expected if you are buying this laptop for programming it is the best option under 60k..one thing which disappointed me is there is no fingerprint scanner and the battery life is ok ok but overall the laptop is good(you can do thodi bhot gaming too); You will not able to look in to its display for 10 mins continuously. I have an another laptop with price less than 30000. Even its display is far better than this. This display don't know about black color. Heavy back light is there in the display. Configuration and performance wise it is good. But for working with this you may need to connect some other monitor.; After using the ASUS Vivobook 15 laptop for 7+ months, it's safe to say that this model has been a huge disappointment. Pehle istemaal kiya fir vishwaas kia.

I happily used my previous laptop from another brand for 7 years. My sister uses another ASUS laptop model that is priced almost half of this one, yet it performs better. The sound of this model is barely audible even when played at full volume when I play something on both laptops. Even my phone's volume is louder and better than this model. Its sound quality is subpar.

The Touchpad sensor does not allow me to select text. Selected text gets deselected on the way while I drag through the text. Sometimes on a single click, it selects the available word or line(magical feature). At times, upon a touchpad left click, options of a right click pop up.

In the name of a thin and light laptop, this model provides an unreliable body. I need to carefully hold it like a baby using both hands, otherwise, it makes a chit-chat sound.

With normal usage (no heavy jobs such as gaming), from day 1, it overheats within an hour. I was expecting better from ASUS. This model does not do justice to the ASUS brand.

If I leave this on sleep, using it again becomes nearly impossible. It takes approximately a minute for the letters I type to appear on the screen (I have Intel Core i7 12th Gen, 16GB).
To me, it's an undesirable model.

Despite my love for the ASUS brand, this purchase has left me feeling let down.; Nice laptop with Stylish appearance and
Sleek design. This process is good and starts within seconds.
The body is mostly plastic and is it comes with backlit keyboard with 3 different modes which makes easy to use while traveling and in dark; In the laptop shutdown button, not seperated. If any situation or human error cleck on shutdown button, pc shutdown"

Very quick delivery
Laptop is worth buying.; Great; Ordered for use with a dual screen add on. Does not have the correct outputs, but found a software solution that is ok. The Windows 11 desktops are nice. Wish they partitioned a little harder, still getting a little jumping/crossover. Having 3 screens of college work, 3 of writing, and 3 for prepping my TTRPG scenarios is pretty sweet though.; Does what it is supposed to do. No complaints.; This is the second HP laptop I've owned. The first one met my needs, although the battery began to expand, making it too dangerous to continue to use. It had a much shorter lifespan than my old Toshiba, which was still working until a few days ago and had been a trusty back-up. I ordered this new HP because I had been satisfied with the first one. That was a mistake. This new one is a piece of garbage! It takes FOREVER to load and at times it takes multiple tries to open my browser. Sometimes I have to reboot. I haven't even transferred my files from the old one, so there is very little on this one.

I've been using this laptop for just 2 days and have only tested one game(God of War 2018) at the time of writing this review.
Pros:1. It is one of the most affordable rtx 3050 laptops. Most laptops at this price range come with gtx 1650 cards. RTX cards have DLSS support, which greatly boosts FPS and enhances gaming experience.
2. Good built and design. I personally love the minimalistic design language of this laptop. There is no screen wobbling, and the typing experience isn't bad either.
Cons: 1.This laptop comes with 16 gb ram, but there is only one ram slot, so there is no room for a future upgrade. Also a missed opportunity for dual channel ram.
2. Below average battery life, but it isn't much of an issue for me because I always use my laptop plugged in for better performance and gaming.
3. Only two USB ports while the competition gives at least 3 ports.
All in all, this is still a good choice in its price segment despite its flaws.; The only reason I'm giving this 4 star is it's battery backup. Not a good battery. Rest this is good to have laptop; It easily runs all games and softwares you throw at it and gives 120+fps in most AAA titles.the build quality is plastic but still pretty great. Thermals are amazing too and the GPU doesn't go over 65C¬∞. Overall amazing product
Charging is pretty fast it goes from 0 to 50 in 30mins.Appearcence is pretty elegant and not gaming themed.It has blue highlights in vents.; It's a very good laptop. The screen, processing, display, keyboard, all perfect for my work. If your work includes multitasking and working on multiple applications/software, this one may fulfil your requirements.

But do note that it's NOT that portable, it's on the heavier side and may be difficult to carry if your work needs moving around or travelling.

Battery life is very average kinds, given it's gaming laptop. With my work (involves running 1-2 processor heavy software and multiple browser windows with real-time data updates) I get max around 3-3.5 hrs backup.

Connectivity is good, wifi 6 gives pretty good speed, ports are good enough to connect multiple things for work.

Didn't use it for gaming, so cannot comment on that.

Regarding McAfee which comes pre-installed. Don't use it, it makes this machine with 16 GB ram and 512 GB SSD feel like an old laptop from 2003-4 with 40gb hdd and 256 MB ram. Initially I thought there's some problem with laptop, but after uninstalling McAfee, it's working fine.; Very good for the price.; It's a good laptop for the price. 83GS003UIN check with this model specs in Lenovo website before buying. If it meets your needs then buy. It doesn't mention RGB keyboard in Lenovo website. But amazon description is misleading.

Pros:
Expected performance for the price with 3050.

Good screen(bright enough 300 nits) & colors .
Linux support seems good. Although most of the lenovo software isn't available for it.

Thermals seem good.

I was able to run genshin at high graphics and record at the same time without hiccups.

Good port selection for my needs

Automatically switches between dedicated graphics and Nvidia optimus.

Cons:
Speaker is trash.
Battery backup is trash.
An AMD CPU would have been better
You can still expect some frame drops occassionally for heavy games.
Windows 11 setup was trash as always. I had to reinstall it.

I use an external keyboard and headphone. So I don't really have issues with the non RGB keyboard and the sound quality.

I'll say it's good for most people if you want a gaming laptop that runs good enough for most needs and has a good screen to look at.; Overall performance was good but battery sucks .; Amazon is cheating there is No RGB Lights in Keyboard.

I have the Starlight, 16GB RAM variant, and it works fine. I recommend purchasing directly from Apple.com.

What I like:
-The display is better.
-The chip is better
-Apple Ecosystem is excellent, no doubt about that.
-The Keyboard is elegant
-Beautiful colour
-Speakers are ambient

What I don't like
-The trackpad is somewhat lighter than the rest of the body, which appears annoying.
-It's delicate
-Apple disapproves of using screen guards and cases
-The screen gets fingerprints quickly, and they are tough to clean
-I have to get Type-C adapters separately, and it's costly at the apple store.
-Expensive

Overall it's an excellent laptop for apple fans, but upgrade it while you buy. The standard 8GB RAM and 256 GB storage is unacceptable for such a price tag. Apple must work on affordability rather than only the device. You can easily make an over-expensive device with impressive performance. But, making it affordable for people is the real challenge.

Don't buy if your sole purpose is to flaunt the apple logo.üôÇ; Excellent product.
Delivered in the next day of purchase.
Excellent performance.
Very slim but, little heavy compared to the slim size because of the rigid body.

Midnight colour look really awesome and appealing. But, could catch too much finger print.
This one is the most interesting colour from Apple if you are a dark colour fan.; This product touch pad is not working properly and Amazon did not help regarding refund or replacement......"

RAM: 16 GB, LPDDR5 5500 MHz‚Äîvery fast, the best RAM as of now
Space: 500 GB, M.2 NVMe ‚Äì top speed,
Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 7520U, 4.3 GHz, ‚Äì very powerful and power efficient processor. You would never need turboboost if you are not playing a high-end graphics game. The processor is not suitable for new generation graphics games. For gaming, Ryzen H-series processors should be chosen.
Screen: FHD (1920 √ó 1080) OLED, very high resolution, bright, and good color but nothing compare to MAC. Would suggest not to put still/static wallpaper, better to put black screen as wallpaper. There is some small issue regarding OLED screen compatibility with MyASUS app. The screen problem is not big if you are using <300 nits, i.e., <50% brightness.
Graphics: AMD Radeon 610M (1900 MHz, integrated) ‚Äì OK graphics, can play normal games in lower FPS. But for day to day activity, more than enough. If you want to run AutoCAD, get a better laptop.
Webcam: poor 720p, expected better quality 1080p
Heating: NO AS OF NOW. But remember, it has a powerful processor.
Battery: 4+Hrs in normal use.

All in all, it is a powerful all-rounder machine in affordable price. With grate processor, ram, and SSD, the machine is quite first.

Most pathetic is amazon return policy ! Money stuck , interest rest mounting on card and no resolution from amazon. Save your time,energy and money!

Only the AXL written doesn't look so amazing. They should change to some logo to make more enticing. But a good sticker can fix it.

There was an issue of audio device not installed. But a quick call with AXL( not Amazon) tech support solved it.; I purchase axl laptop from Amazon the laptop is not good there is sound problem ni sound coming and secondly no technician visited to check the fault they trying to sortit out by what's up and laptop not downloading what's up I told them to collect my laptop and I want to return my laptop and give my money back nobody is answering the call nor they gave my money back I suggest do not buy this laptop is wastage of time money and service is very bad
Amazon can you get may money back I do not want this laptop kindly arrange for return back; A good laptop for its price. You will get a bare nuc by Intel in this price, and you have to add monitor, ram, SSD etc.

Good things
Price
Build quality
Sound for its price
Minimum configuration provided for its price.

Bad things
Touchpad not good
Windows lags continuosly
Not upgradable. Just you can change SSD.
Battery backup not as advertised. Max it can go on is 3-4 hours.

Proposed solutions for the laptop
Install manjaro Linux, works beautifully on this laptop.
For that disable secure boot in the bios.
Daily work like office, and web surfing is ok.
If you put multi tabs load on it, sometimes it may occur that the laptop is hanging, just try to restart it. Although it happened one or two times in Linux but more frequently in windows.; Best from Amazon
Have a great day
You save my loss on desktop and value of product

Sean Ross; product is very good as the prise ..; I have purchased it 9 months back, from the 2nd month of purchase it's sound drive is not working, called/whatsApp customer care in the given number many times but didn't get any support, warranty period is about to complete.; Liked the size and weight, appearance can be a bit better with respect to the logo, laptop lookwise is good. Charging is a bit slow but i think it better for battery longevity. Boots up real fast. Has 1 mini Hdmi port, sd card slot, 3 usb ports, 3.5mm jack and ethernet port. Battery lasted for about 4 hours. Charger is small like a normal 12v adapter. Using for presentations, ppt and excel with occassional movie watching.; If I would be having an option of below 1 star, I would have given that to this. Not even browser is opening, CPU goes to 100% in the first boot of the device, totally unusable. TRASH DEVICE."

So we know where cost cutting was done.
Students can go for this laptop.; I was in 2 minds whether to buy this or not after going through the reviews. Many people were complaining about the lappy over heating. It's common sense that there should proper vent out for the in-built fan to blow out the heat. If there is no vent, it's apparent that the machine over heats.

If you are not that tech savvy and need a daily driver, its better to pay a bit more and get the laptop with preinstalled windows and MS office.
For tinkerers or someone who wants to run linux (I used linux mint), this works well. Use a USB stick, install your OS (if you want to dualboot, install windows first, then your other OS), and get your drivers.
However keep in mind, there is no internet drivers in the laptop (both wifi and ethernet), so you will have issues installing windows 11 unless you install drivers using CMD or use a USB wifi dongle. So its better to install windows 10, and then update to 11 for ease of use.

Although yes, one con is that speakers aren't the loudest so it's best used with headphones or external speakers.; Although it's smooth but the applications lag at some times. Let's see for the future.; I ordered this yesterday (June 5th, 2024) and received it today (June 6th, 2024). First I noticed the lenovo package seal was cut halfway, I thought it could be torn by poor package handling and the laptop should be okay. The laptop was actually ok but when i checked on Lenovo's warranty site, I got to know it was activated already on 29th March 2024.. May be it was a used one and I lost two months of warranty.. Worst experience with amazon cc today for a simple solution they made me wait and bounced me like a ping pong ball for more than 3 hours to different representatives and unclear and worst explanation. Finally they have initiated an investigation about why some white sticker where on all the bar codes around the box and about the warranty too and asked me to wait till june 10th ... I sometimes have bad time with Appario retail but Amazon is quick to take return of products from non amazon sellers and not for Appario.. Why?; Pros:
Build Quality
Screen 300 nits brightness
2 RAM DDR5 Slots
2 M.2 gen4 slots
Latest wifi6
Light weight
Fingerprint
Camera with Shutter Privacy

Best option for business use, study, mid level video editing
Battery üîã life nice ... getting about 6+ hours on video over the wifi

Cons:
Not Evo rated
Keyboard back-lit

Note: laptop will comes with great upgradibilty options. It's make it future proof.

Few customer may be finding an issue of warranty.
Dates are not correct.

Need to login to your lenovo account and fill the form to register and this will fix the issue.

You just need to change the date of purchase.; Installed windows 11, ethernet / wifi drives installed via USB , added 16GB RAM (you can add single 32GB stick) to free slot and total RAM is 24GB now and will add nvme to empty slot if needed in future

- Windows 11 professional- 600Rs from Amazon reseller
- 16GB ram for 3k
- mcafee antivirus rs500 from Amazon reseller; I am happy with the laptop, since you get what you paid for.
Expect these in this laptop:
1. No Kayboard light
2. Though it says that the display is HD, but the display is not upto the mark. Colour looks different when you change the viewing angle.
3. Sound quality is quite good
4. Battery life is moderate. My other i5 thinkpad lasts longer with similar usage. Charges pretty fast with its 65watt charger
5. It is slightly heavy due to it's metal body; I liked the anti glare screen quality of the laptop. Lenovo has a very good laptop üíªüëç; Very good product if it's fits in your budget must go for it"

This was the only one available with SATA port and reasonably recent CPU and a reasonable price. On that front, it is great.

However, I wanted to use it with Linux, and on that front I took a huge risk. Luckily, almost everything works fine on Linux. However, suspend to RAM doesn't work. To go into details, the BIOS doesn't support S3 sleep. It only supports S0x sleep, support for which is only beginning to mature in Linux. I am currently forced to use hibernate, which is slower.; Worst display quality , sound quality is also not good , customer care don't pick up the call , customer care don't response on return policy , not value for money; Superior look and light weight
AMD is always better than Intel in overall performance; I bought this laptop about 10 months ago,I have to say the laptop performance is good,great upgrade options, but have note that acer service quality is poor I live in Pune and the have only on service center,no pickup available, I didn't like the customer care as they didn't provide me with the solution,I am disappointed üòû with the brand after sale service . Literally pathatic.; It's not bad, but not good either. I bought it for 38,990. I was getting the same price for some other acer laptop with intel i5 1155g7 processor and IPS display, but I missed the deal. So, I bought this ‚òπÔ∏è.

Pros:
1- Performance is not an issue. Decent performance for most of the tasks.
2- Didn't do gaming, so not sure of that. But for programming, it's good.
3- Good for multitasking.
4- Audio is good. It's not loud, but sufficient and it comes with Nahimic audio (for which you will have to download it's app) which enhances it's audio capabilities. Audio can be optimised for different purpose.
5- Sufficient ports. Also have type C port.
6- It has control center to control fan speed, external keyboard light, manage fan speed, power.
7- Battery is decent and can last 4-5 hours on regular workload. But on heavy workload, it will last around 2-2.5 hours.
8- Lookwise it is good.
9- lifetime windows 11 home.

Cons:
1- Although display is antiglare FHD. It's not IPS, so it looks crisp but average. It's just ok for the purpose of coding or regular tasks where we just want the work to be done. Since viewing angle are bad, so for entertainment, it's good for single person for watching movies but not for multiple people. Display is not good for graphic designer who needs color accuracy.
2- There is no backlit keyboard. So, if you want backlit, connect external keyboard with backlit.
3- Although it has an SSD, I didn't find the boot time to be faster. It is fast but didn't meet my expectations.
4- Graphic card is not dedicated which is just good for normal work. I don't think you will enjoy gaming on it. It can play light games but surely you won't enjoy gaming on such system. And it won't able to play high demanding games.
5- Doesn't have activated ms office. You will have to buy it's keys.

Note:
You can install a separate harddisk (HDD) for storing data. Screws are provided with laptop.

For me, the bottom side became very hot and fans started making noise, when it first arrived and I was installing windows updates on it first used it on my bed, that is without proper ventilation. But with proper air flow, it doesn't heat.

Conclusion:
If you are limited on budget and only want your work to be done and doesn't care much about display quality or back lit keyboard or you aren't a gamer, you can buy it.
And if you already bought it, don't regret your decision. It's a ok laptop for most of the task and will get your work done.

UPDATE:- It hangs in middle, and everything stops working not even power button unless I press it for long time to force shutdown.....all my work was lost and mind you I was not doing a heavy task that it couldn't handle, simple web browsing and it stopped in middle, nothing worked....really frustrated..... Don't know if it was windows 11 issue or due to cheap hardware of this machine,ü•πüò°; nice laptop for the price paid...got good exchange price also for old laptop.."

Review after 1 month of use:

Processor:
-Ryzen 7530U is a best processor clubbed with 16GB RAM is very good for programming or running heavy applications.

Keyboard:
-I am not quite happy with the new keyboard in Gen 5 as compared to older gen. Lenovo says its more tactile but i feel it moved more towards chicket one which is not what a thinkpad user likes.

Webcam:
- Webcam could have been better. If there is a even a small light source opp. to the camera, images get very blur. In proper lighting it ok to use, but better to have a seperate webcam if your work requires frequent calls.

Battery:
- Battery backup is good for a window laptop. With Balanced setting it can easily last for 6-7 hours. Company claims 12 hrs which i feel is not possible and just a gimmick.

Display:
- Anti Glare screen is just amazing. you will love this if you are a developer and casual OTT consumer. However this is a IPS panel which i feel is the biggest upgrade from older gen thinkpads at this price range, but max brightness is slightly on the lower side of 250 nits. I may be feeling this slightly more i as i used Macbook Air M1 which has around 400 nits with retina display. Since this being built for professional use, i wouldn't recommend this for graphic designing or photoshop due to low colour accuracy in the display

Ports:
Having 2 USB Type C port in Gen 5 is a great plus. You get 2 high speed type a as well. Having Lan and HDMI port is a great relief compared to my Mac

Win 11 & Office:
Both comes pre installed and best part pre activated, you just need to link you office got and done.

Overall a great laptop for developers and normal OTT consumer. Value for money product with military grade design."

I am review lenovo thinkbook ryzen 3 7330U
Battery backup is amazing 4 to 5 hour
Fingerprint is working properly
Display quality 4.5
Sound quality is average 4.0
No heating issue
Overall Good.; This Think book is great for productive work! Excellent Lenovo customer support! Recommend adding an additional 8GB/DDR4 3200 RPM Ram. Presently, 2GB is shared with Radeon Graphics, therefore for better performance with video editing, coding, and basic gaming. Excellent battery -life/8 hours in my case! The fingerprint scanner is very responsive providing an instant boot-up! The Display is average, but, the antiglare coating is noteworthy!
Overall, very Happy!; It has been 4 days I am using this laptop . Everything is good in this laptop , it got lot of additional features at this price point like fingerprint sensor ,dolby audio, fast charging 65watt.
3 things that I don't like about this product is that the battery backup is not so good it only last 3-4 hours at minimal to medium usage although I haven't done any gaming or performance test on it so I cant, say about performance ,second is that the speaker sound is so low but sound quality is so good and the 3rd one is that the camera quality is like 2mega pixel its not good.
BTW it has ryzen 3 5300u which quite good processor as 5000 series is dope ,everybody knows.

If you guys are having a budget of 30000-35000 definitely check this product. Don't buy 512 gb variant it cost around 37000-38000 , you won't get anything additional in it except storage. If have that 40000 budget go for redmibook 15 pro i5 or honor magicbook 15 i5.

Screen is decent , brightness may bother you sometimes but its enough .
Build quality is decent it has metal body and its a military grade certified laptop.

I will suggest alternative laptops around 30000-35000 ,1) Honor magicbook x 15 but service is no available everywhere and it has windows 10
2) redmibook 15 i3 but build is plastic
3) acer extensa 15 but you get 4gb ram under 30000

I will update this review after 1 month usage and some gaming test also.; Previously i owned an Acer swift laptop (10th gen i5 with ssd) which cost me almost 60k. But it could not handle the indian summer heat and became dead before completing 3 years.
After that i understood the drawbacks of compact, thin laptops(also the 'fast startup' power iption).
So i bought this sturdy 15 incher. This is a proper heavy laptop. I hope it can withstand the indian summer.
Cons are no backlit keyboard.
And those who are confused about RAM management, its because if integrated AMD memory which is included in the RAM. Thus 6 gb RAM + 2 gb graphics.
I hope to increase my RAM and ssd memory after sometime; Display is really bad, may be it's good for the eyes I don't use it much.; This is the review from my 10-year-old son.

1) He is using it for educational and gaming purposes. He finds it is smooth to play roblox, minecraft, Fortnite, and fall guys.
2) Ryzen 3 is absolutely smooth and doesn't lag.
3) Connectivity is quick.
4) Antiglare display helps in better viewability.
5)Battery backup is awesome and there is no need for frequent charging.; This laptop has only one extra SDD slot, you can buy Sata3 SDD and use another OS like linux or other. But some video over net may confuse you that it has one spare M2 slot. Boot from SD card or USB does not work on this PC though this is with UEFI interface. Pressing F12 does not show up, bootable USB, if it is linux. Workaround for this is install UEFI grub option on your USB stick, then it will appear in F12. Other that that sound is good, and you can expand memory upto 40GB which is good. Battery is descent I use almost for 7-8 hours. Weight wise it is bit heavy. Screen is good but I am not fussy about screen. Overall good laptop at the price. Has fingerprint, and wifi6, processor is Radeon3 4x4.; Useful purchase"

For this price range no cons could be pointed out; Good for it; ; Build quality is too poor. Eg. if u life the laptop with one hand, it bends. Top of the laptop dips with one small finger press. Definitly a very fragile laptop. Handle with utmost care.; Good product but heating issue; Nice One; Like it's smooth, sleek design, no heating issue. Fast processor. Easy to continue my day to day work. Nice power back up. I wish company will provide a carry bag in near future. Best wishes for Asus. Thank you Amazon for nice packaging; It's a we'll functioning laptop at a bargain price and it meets all basic needs. Unless you're a gammer or a heavy programmer, this is a pretty economic laptop"

Nothing more to say.; Good product; Good but battery life could have been better; 1. though I am a prime customer, delivery was delayed 4 days than promised.
2. No Technician visit will happen, during the return period. so better to return or go for a refund if any issues during that period.
3. Game Pass - forget about it. no one knows anything about it.

coming to laptop:
performance is good. The battery back is little poor only I can say. if you do not put it on the stand it will get heated up. you need to put it on a stand while using it.
I see charged adapter is also very hot than usual. not sure why.; Writting this review after using for a month :-

Best design and build quality you can buy as it contains ssd which gives best performance for an day to day life and charging last for upto 4 hrs and also best in preformnce.

Can buy this laptop for an day to day user and; 1; I am a loyal lenovo customer and this is my 3rd lenovo laptop purchase. The quality of lenovo laptops have been the best so far but this model quality is not upto the mark. Without 9 months of usage my laptop battery is not working... although is shows 100% charged but the laptop goes blank whenever the charging cable is disconnected as if battery is not present in the laptop.
This is pathetic; Good performance but speaker low volume and camera less quality"

Looking at the brand which is still at its baby stage is making awesome product that too budget friendly people like me who are on a very tight budget should definitely go for this. Don't always go by the big brand guys there are smaller brands as well who are waiting to explode and make history. Just look at the features of the product and compare the prices with the other brands and that's what a smart buyer does.; ; Battery takes over 12 hours to fully charge and discharges in 2 hours of usage. This is unexpected as the product description claims something else. Other features are ok; Laptop is very light, processor is good according to its price. Overall value for its price.; Laptop is okay for price, u can't expect a sturdy laptop for price under 30k, but there is lot of room for improvement, trackpad is not accurate, Audio volume is on the lower side, laptop gets heat up quickly.
So we know where cost cutting was done.
Students can go for this laptop.; I was in 2 minds whether to buy this or not after going through the reviews. Many people were complaining about the lappy over heating. It's common sense that there should proper vent out for the in-built fan to blow out the heat. If there is no vent, it's apparent that the machine over heats.

POV: It's a perfect laptop at this price for general usage, mid range gaming and for core coding.; Battry very poor quality pls don't buy this product

Good screen, great design, feels expensive for the price, good price to performance ratio. It offers a new 16:10 aspect ratio in the mass market of boring laptops, build quality is way better than Lenovo and Dell.

Dislike :

It comes with Windows 11, Has only 1 Ssd slot.

Some points to clear confusion:

1. There's 1 free Ram slot on 8 Gb model (8gb is Soldered on Motherboard) which can accommodate a 16 Gb stick making it a total of 24 Gb Ram for future.
* There's no free Ram slot in 16 Gb model (8 Gb is soldered on the motherboard and there's a 8gb stick in the Ram slot, so when it comes to upgrade the Ram, you'll have to replace the 8 Gb with a 16 Gb stick and your original 8 Gb will be wasted.

2. There's only 1 SSD slot which is preoccupied with the 512 Gb ssd. You can upgrade the ssd (technically replace the current one) upto 2 TB.

3. The brightness of the screen is way better than your average Lenovo, Dell laptops. The colors are crisp and display looks great while consuming content and browsing the Internet.

4. WiFi & Bluetooth works like a charm.

5. TouchPad is good and spacious and the fingerprint reader is fast too.

6. The camera shutter is a blessing in disguise.

7. The battery backup is decent, I got around 8 hours when I was working with WiFi on and around 10 hours when I was watching TV series with WiFi off.
*The screen brightness was at 40% with wired earphones.

If you're someone who doesn't do hardcore gaming, needs a laptop that will help you with your work, media consumption and casual gaming, then this is your laptop.

I hope this helps.; this is one of the perfect machine the onely cons is that the sound quality is less and everything is peak; 1} the battery life is good
2]performance is top notch
3] the packaging is ok because no air bags were placed inside or to the side of the laptop box instead you are paying so much money. i was really worried after placing an online order.
4}if you are thinking of buying the Ryzen 7 5800H series then just go for it , as the discount applied by amazon truly gives the right product.
5}from this seller i am really impressed by the the genuine product they have given.
6} i am really disappointed by the delivery boy through which they have delivered the behaviour is very bad .
7] the set up for the laptop was quite easy no needed for additional set up from amazon.
8}over all the processor, the ram the variant is amazing . i would recommend this laptop to everyone as it has a lot of additional features like backlit keyboard in dark is pretty good , the sound quality of the audio box is very good while playing any music or movie or video.; The performance is good for the price range .. battery is also good.. but display is decent; Nice design with silver color, light weight, ryzen 7 processor can handle multiple process at same time easily. speakers volume loudness is bit low, battery time around 5 hour with moderate level use"

It is having two no. Of cooling fan as per manual. No heating issue. I love the product.; Have been using it for over a week now. The Laptop looks and feels premium. Performance is quite good for now.

Pros:
1)Screen is gorgeous
2)Optimal Trackpad
3)Backlit Keyboard with good amount of key travel
4)12th gen processor.
5)Has slot for additional SSD

Cons:
1)The speakers are PATHETIC. Entry level laptops have better speaker.
2)Battery could have been much better. Lasts for about 6-6.5 hours with normal use.
3)Lacks voice assistant, but honestly it‚Äôs not a deal breaker
4)Soldered Ram

Verdict: Overall Good device with certain cons. Folks looking to buy this for entertainment might be discouraged by the speaker, but the screen is gorgeous. I mainly bought this for work and it perfectly serves my purpose. I would have given it 3.5/5, However, I bought this early and got the Galaxy buds 2 for 999. I would say this makes up for the terrible speakers :P

Hence my final rating is 4/5

P.S MS Office was not activated. However, Samsung service personnel and Microsoft technicians helped me out with this and solved the problem. As promised, this does come with Ms Office.

P.P.S First, fully update your Laptop. Then, contact Microsoft support and share with them the receipt. In my case, first, they uninstalled MS Office 365, then they installed MS Office home & student 2021. Then they did some of their magic and it was activated. All this happened via screen share and it took around 1.5 hours.; Suitable for software development and entertainment.; Best laptop and best performance value for Samsung laptop the product say the brand name 5out 5; After using the product for 9months, writing this review. The laptop hinge the lid open close broke automatically with no physical damage as the laptop was kept at study table for home use only. Now for fixing the hinge, the samsung service center responded that they can fix by replacing the entire monitor part which will cost 10800rs.

So whoever is purchasing this laptop, be mindful that hardware parts are not robust and require servicing within 1year of usage and it will not be covered under warranty; An all rounder with sleek professional design.; product is nice with decent battery 4-5 hr but on my laptop it has a little issues in its back as it is not properly pasted so i asked for replacement but they are only providing the return and refund option but i applied a coupon now the price increased so i asked for replacement .but from day1 in seven day replacement i checked it many times but never got the option of replacement; speed is good. best professional laptop. handle big excel file easily."

It runs quite smoothly and multitasking is not an issue at all. You can even do HD video editing (upto 3-4 layers and not recommend for 4k video editing).
Typing experience is great and you even get a 3 month free trial for Xbox games.
Lenevo IdeaPad 3 is also available in this range with i3 12th gen which is also a great choice.
The difference between two of them is that ASUS vivobook 14 is better for graphic intensive task as compared to Lenovo IdeaPad 3.; I am really enjoying it; As far as i have used my previous laptops , i advice this laptop for minimal usage . This is the first time i am using a AMD Ryzen 3 , i will check for few more days . As we r all used to intel dont know how will this perfom. I suggest its for just a minimal usage for with limited speed and performance for this budget.; Great laptop

I asked for replacement, they said replacement wasn't available, it had to be returned. They did not pickup despite scheduling the pickup up twice. Also, every time the reason mentioned was pickup refused by customer which is totally false. If I was contacted I need proof of the same.

I need to travel tomorrow and it will be such a big issue for me now.My work is suffering so much. The customer care people are also not responding. It has been a horrendous experience.; The photo in display and the video shows the laptop to have a USB C port. The product that i received only has the USB 2 ports...NO USB C port (could be just an oversight or error by the seller). It's just a day since it arrived, no complaints as such yet. Looks like a laptop worth it's money.; Not so good product; The laptop has a heating issue, and the screen display is not satisfactory. It may be considered as an economical laptop from Dell from the heating is not expected from such a brand.; ; laptop Performance is Ok , especially availability of genuine windows and MS office Home edition along with bunch of other software preloaded. only you have to partition the SSD into local drives at your end to keep Program files in C drive . Otherwise it is Fast , better performance in 12th generation i3 processor from 11th generation i5.
Heating issue is there in all dell laptops including this one, so i will wait for next 2-3 months to check whether this heating issue creates any problem in performance of laptop in summers.
Dell shall arrange to direct blowers not towards the screen as in present case , in my opinion the the heat coming from blowers towards the screen may reduce or impact Screen due to heat blow. Laptop also heats from below , so i don't think it is advisable to keep it on lap ( legs) , better to operate on table or some platform.; Dislike:
USB Type C port is not there, however the product images and videos claim there is one Type C port.
Sad, Misleading claim.

5. Display is amazing, very rare to find 180 degree tilt at this price point
6. Build is very sturdy even after having metal body it is very light weight making it easy to carry around

Cons :-
1. Not used to fingerprint sensor on the left side, will get used to it by time

Overall the laptop is very premium (look feel and performance) and amazing, a highly recommended laptop; The laptop is great performances good has good build quality startup time is almost instant with fast boot on and around 4sec with it off
Don‚Äôt charge it overnight because the fingerprint sensor will stop working as the battery has expanded a little microphone has constant buzzing sound to it I recommend to get a new one secure boot was not on by default and it came with windows 11 22h2 installed and. Not 23h2; The product is good, has all latest features, but battery backup is poor , just 2-3 hours , and zenronics service center team won't even accept that battery are getting drained soon , they won't even replace the product..so think before buying; Every thing is working fine and smooth, Good job zebronics; This laptop has battery issue . The battery charging capacity wears down in five months and the battery life is gone as well. You can‚Äôt use it without connected to a charger. The fingerprint reader sucks.

The display is good; Purchased this device trusting this brand, but the product has a series of defects. It products electrical shock when charging.

When I asked amazon for a replacement they asked to contact zebronics customer care but, zebronics customer care said the following:
While the charger is plugged in the Laptop, there is a possibility of electronic charges forming on the Laptop‚Äôs Metal panel. Customers need not worry about this condition as most Laptops with Metal body might face such a condition, and it is not harmful to users.

I have purchased for my kids and they want to give my kids this laptop that has electric shock. I told the same to amazon and they are telling that the service should be done from zebronics end, where I get a zero response. Really a bad experience with amazon and zebronics. Being a prime customer and years of purchasing with amazon its time for me to think twice to make any electronic gadget purchase from amazon. If you are planning to buy product from amazon check their return policy twice as most of the products have this service center replacement where you will get a zero response from the service center.

Update:

The charger provided with the laptop is a two pin charger it's the reason for the electric shock. I went to the service center they verified it and told zebronics but zebronics representative are telling that it would not harm you. Practically they are asking the customer to use the device that has this electric shock issue. I asked for a replacement of charger and they are telling that all our charges has this and it will not harm you.

Look how worse their team is, I don't think they have done proper testing with the accessories or devices. Worst experience with the zebronics team. The saddest part is they have 19v USB C charger which is not available in local market and in Amazon. Now struck with the product. If the device works for atleast a year I'll be happy so that I don't have to goback to their funny technical team.

I regret my decision to try this brand.; This laptop is actually pretty good and gives what the big brands couldn't in this price range, even though it has its flaws like sometimes fingerprint does not work, or even never work again excluding this it offers many user-friendly applications in daily life, and also the gaming can be done without any lag if you don't play every day.

Here are a few things I enjoy and don't like.

The Thinkbook was the last model I saw while I was shopping for a laptop to buy, and I kind of loved all the specs in this price range. When compared to every other brand with the same specifications, this appeared to be a great deal.

I didn't know this till after I bought the laptop, but out of all the features I appreciate, the speaker is among the worst. For the past two years, I have been using my friend's HP laptop, which has the best speaker ever‚Äîit produces great sound even when it is only half loud. Please cross this laptop off the list if you're searching for one with nice speakers.

I've now noticed that the screen brightness is the next drawback. In all of the screens, I always use the lowest possible screen brightness. I would always use '0' on the same HP laptop because that is my ideal brightness level; however, with this laptop, I had to use at least two levels.

Other than the two drawbacks mentioned above, I haven't had any difficulties. Once I've used it for a while, I'll update the long-term review.

If any of you utilize this laptop, kindly share any positive and negative aspects with us.; This product for suppose to be a gift for my mom but turned to be a nightmare. Ever this product was delivered my mom has been trying to turn the new piece on but the display shows a blank a screen. Just a heads up the battery is fully charged. On speaking with amazon they said have a word with Lenovo on it.
Lenovo has been throwing tantrums that contact the supplier. It seems that nobody is ready to take the responsibility and busy playing blame games. Lenovo promised to send technician on calling Monday morning but I get a simple email from them that the serial number doesn‚Äôt match the invoice hence contact supplier. Though over the call they did say that the technician will come over and check the invoice soft copy. My parents are in their 60‚Äôs Amazon take up the responsibility and issue a replacement. As it‚Äôs not my parents mistake that the product turned out to be defective but they are facing the consequences for it.; Best product for daily office use; I think that this is the cheapest laptop with a Ryzen 7730U Processor, 8 GB RAM and a Fingerprint Sensor. I purchased this for my father, who likes his gadgets to be as future-proof as possible. This laptop is priced at under 50K, and at that you get a sturdy workhorse of a machine.

Pros
- Very sturdy build. Laptop looks so pleasant and elegant.
- Keyboard is classic Lenovo. Very good typing experience, backlight is available in 3 modes: off, low and high.
- Up gradability: You can add another RAM, and the 512GB SSD can be swapped for a 1TB in the long run.
- Charges using USB port, but doesn't charge via phone/tablet chargers. I tried my 33W Xiaomi Adapter as well as my OnePlus 100W Adapter. Neither worked. But the laptop's charger charges my phone and tablet just fine. It's a good option as it charges in 4 Voltages: 5V, 9V, 15V and 20V.
- Fingerprint Sensor works like a charm.
- Webcam is more than acceptable.

Cons
- This laptop does NOT come with Windows 11 Preinstalled. You need to install it on your own.
- During Windows 11 installation, I felt the laptop heating a bit, the heat seeps through the keyboard, and you feel it near the WASD keys. I didn't experience this issue during regular use though.
- If you charge the Laptop while using it, even for casual tasks, it takes a bit longer to charge.

To sum it up, if you want the Lenvo reliability and a good processor, all under 50K, this one is where your search ends.; Sound quality is worst üò©.
Overall performance is good.; ; Good laptop in budget but if u want see it's real performance upgrade ram to 16gb buy and u can play pubg g in 1080p in 60 to 81 fps but I don't suggest it I just check and I have to video editing also only screen is con other than that everything is super in this budget"

It is very fast and durable.; Hello, i have been using this laptop for 7 days now. It has some good features and some bad ones. This laptop firstly came with an intel core i3 12th gen processor which has a quite good reputation. This computer is very butter smooth multitasking laptop. It has 8GB of Ram which makes the laptop capable to run multiple apps and chrome tab without any hassle, it doesn't take much time to open chrome. This computer aslo has a NVMe 512GB SSD, i love how they added this SSD to make the laptop faster, the boot time of this laptop is less than 9 seconds (depending on how may applications are installed). It is a very fast SSD in your budget (i think). The battery backup is kinda good, it keeps your laptop on the go for almost 10 hours without its charger (depending on what you are doing on the laptop). This laptop is equipped with Intel UHD 780 graphics with 4GB VRAM which makes the laptop capable of mid video editing and photo editing without hassle. Asking about gaming, I played Tom Clancy's The Divisions, GTA V on this, i got almost smooth 60fps on 720p lowest settings. Since i told the good side of it. Here are some drawbacks of this laptop. This laptop have poor sound quality like the volume is too low for me i think. That's all...; Yes autocad running smoothly on this laptop you can also play heavy games like gta v, far cry series on this as a casual gaming purpose. Ram is upgradable upto 32 GB it's really awesome. Thank you acer for made a good laptop in this price range. No heating issue till now . Display quality is also nice at this price range. Smoothness when I'm talking about it it's running so smooth . Overall a good laptop for students, office user & also casual gamers. Review after one month of use.; The power button of the laptop is problematic. The laptop doesn't get on when we press the power button. One need to put the laptop on charge to turn it on. I first thought that the laptop is not charged hence it is happening but this happens again and again as when the laptop turns on it shows more that 50% charged but it doesn't get turned on without putting on charge.; Laptop is overall good for students*.

It would have been better if the display resolution is 2.8k and refresh rate is 90hz.; Perfect product with good pricing; I received a totally brand-new laptop as I expected. It ran smoothly and everything was found the same as I ordered. However, after placing an order, I had several doubts.
The laptop is Mast...; Has been using it for a week now. Very good performance and battery backup.
Very light weight and very less noise as well.
One issue which occurred on first day, it was not able to auto correct start-up failure but doing factory-reset helped in that. Now it is running very smooth.
Keyboard build quality is not very good. It should have been better,; light weight, longer battery life, 3 years in built warranty with damage protection and battery replacement and of course cheaper price.; Good; I purchased Lenovo ideapad flex 5 ryxen 7 from day one the battery drain issue i face. Do not purchase this laptop company is not taking any responsibility it just been 5 days from my purchase do not purchase Lenovo products very bad customer service they have"

The video quality is superb.
The heating problem is there.
Not compatible gaming as some of the game expected hardware is not available.
I am a music lover, so I was expecting the sound quality to be better as laptop loaded with 2W speakers.
The battery backup is good.; The Ideapad Slim 5, is a high-quality laptop, perfect for office use. It boasts excellent features, including i5, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. The speed is impressive, making it a strong recommendation for anyone in need of a reliable work companion.; Pros
Good build quality
Anti Glare works fine
Display is good
Charging is fast enough
Keyboard is very good
Backlight keys are well illuminated
Performance is good
Cons
Battery last 3 hrs at 65% brightness
Heating with normal usages
Heating on charging even in switched off
Display brightness is ok but it feels low sometimes.
No RJ45 connector; First of all thanks to Amazon for the fastest deliveries less than 24 hours with good shape.
Now on the laptop front superb finish love at first sight, it is a clean laptop with all the essential features. Top lid is of metal a premium quality laptop with precise cut at each and every corner. It is a 12th Generation i5 - 12450H processor laptop due to which no issues at the processing of task no matter what you give, it run as a breeze, no fingerprint sensor, no graphics card it had a internal graphics card which is terrible if you want this laptop for gaming purpose then do not purchase this. I have purchased this as i have no use of graphics card.

Pros:

ASPECT RATIO: 16:10 ( Major highlight which is helpful in Coding )
SCREEN : IPS Panel with 60Hz resolution with good viewing angle.
CHARGER: 65 Watt Charger with USB type C
FRONT CAM: 720p with privacy shutter.
SSD: 500 GB (with upgradable option)
TRACK PAD : Very nice wide and smooth scroll with good tactile feedback.
BACKLITE KEYBOARD : YES

Cons:

RAM: 16 GB ( not upgradable this is a major downside of this laptop which is so expensive)
HDD: ( no slot for HDD )
FINGERPRINT : NO
GRAPHICS CARD: Inbuilt

HEATING ISSUE:

Most important due to which I gave it a less rating since Lenovo knows it is a H series processor therefore vents should be cut out at the side end of the laptop but at present the vent is at the screen & bottom end due to which when performing high priority tasks it becomes hot as it is clocked at base 2.0 Ghz the keyboard area becomes hot and due to vents placed at screen side screen & metal lid becomes hot not that much hot but still a premium laptop Ideapad 5 series should not have this kind of issues. During benchmark test the keyboard area becomes serious hot and the screen area the right bottom area becomes hot due to vent throwing air at the screen.; Pros:
Look is amazing
16 GB ram is good enough for advanced multitasking
Light weight

Cons:
No FPR; Battery drainage issue üò≠. I have High expectations on this. Literally so frustrated.
When we are on meetings when we turn on camera falsh light automatically turns on and no option to turn it off . So frustrating we can't concentrate on anything else if it keep disturbing our eyes.

I literally don't like that flash when we use camera

Expect these everything is fine; Good product"

Thank you amazon üôè; Pro - Well built quality. Nice display. Fast booting. Best laptop in this price range.

Con - No MS Office.; Excellent laptop - have been using it for close to a year now - no issues at all!
smooth and powerful - the 16GB RAM & SSD makes it real fast and responsive; The laptop is great
Latest 13th Gen processor
Display is awesome
Light weight and slim
Battery backup is more than 7 hours; a few times display went into disarray. i was shocked. it hasn't been even a month. I am worried. i dunno if it's a software problem or hardware problem. it became alright after restart. never trust chinese companies; I really liked the product and got it at a very good price INR 43990, after that it went unavailable. I think only few stocks were left as it was a 2023 model. The body, look and feel is similar to mac book, touch pad is very smooth and processing & windows transition speed is really superb and display is really great considering the price. Earlier i was bit hesitant to buy this one, but after buying it have no regret at all. Thanks to Amazon and Seller both for providing me value for money item at a very good price.; Very good product, amazing style slim.; The laptop has a H series CPU. H-series is better than P and far better than U. So, for routine activities, this laptop is more than sufficient. Screen quality, brightness, visibility angle and color reproduction are all great. Wifi and BT works as expected. Audio quality is acceptable. Trackpad is good too. No heating issues. It has nice metal body. This laptop is a good choice for work, education and for general home usage for everyone.

Default setting for keyboard backlight timeout (15s) is annoying. One has to change it in Honor PC Manager. It is possible to play games with the provided Intel graphics, but that's not this laptop is meant for. Included charger's external casing is poorly designed. If there is a switch next to power socket, it will be pushed to ON when you plug in. Charger gets hot sometimes, not worrisome though. When installing your own Windows copy you will need drivers. One needs to go their China website and search based on serial number to get Honor PC manager. It will download all drivers. I wish this gets simpler.

Product support is a big let down. I had a DOA product. Getting a replacement taught me various lessons about this company. If you worry about hardware support, think twice."

Here are a few things I enjoy and don't like.

The Thinkbook was the last model I saw while I was shopping for a laptop to buy, and I kind of loved all the specs in this price range. When compared to every other brand with the same specifications, this appeared to be a great deal.

I didn't know this till after I bought the laptop, but out of all the features I appreciate, the speaker is among the worst. For the past two years, I have been using my friend's HP laptop, which has the best speaker ever‚Äîit produces great sound even when it is only half loud. Please cross this laptop off the list if you're searching for one with nice speakers.

I've now noticed that the screen brightness is the next drawback. In all of the screens, I always use the lowest possible screen brightness. I would always use '0' on the same HP laptop because that is my ideal brightness level; however, with this laptop, I had to use at least two levels.

Other than the two drawbacks mentioned above, I haven't had any difficulties. Once I've used it for a while, I'll update the long-term review.

If any of you utilize this laptop, kindly share any positive and negative aspects with us.; This product for suppose to be a gift for my mom but turned to be a nightmare. Ever this product was delivered my mom has been trying to turn the new piece on but the display shows a blank a screen. Just a heads up the battery is fully charged. On speaking with amazon they said have a word with Lenovo on it.
Lenovo has been throwing tantrums that contact the supplier. It seems that nobody is ready to take the responsibility and busy playing blame games. Lenovo promised to send technician on calling Monday morning but I get a simple email from them that the serial number doesn‚Äôt match the invoice hence contact supplier. Though over the call they did say that the technician will come over and check the invoice soft copy. My parents are in their 60‚Äôs Amazon take up the responsibility and issue a replacement. As it‚Äôs not my parents mistake that the product turned out to be defective but they are facing the consequences for it.; I think that this is the cheapest laptop with a Ryzen 7730U Processor, 8 GB RAM and a Fingerprint Sensor. I purchased this for my father, who likes his gadgets to be as future-proof as possible. This laptop is priced at under 50K, and at that you get a sturdy workhorse of a machine.

Pros
- Very sturdy build. Laptop looks so pleasant and elegant.
- Keyboard is classic Lenovo. Very good typing experience, backlight is available in 3 modes: off, low and high.
- Up gradability: You can add another RAM, and the 512GB SSD can be swapped for a 1TB in the long run.
- Charges using USB port, but doesn't charge via phone/tablet chargers. I tried my 33W Xiaomi Adapter as well as my OnePlus 100W Adapter. Neither worked. But the laptop's charger charges my phone and tablet just fine. It's a good option as it charges in 4 Voltages: 5V, 9V, 15V and 20V.
- Fingerprint Sensor works like a charm.
- Webcam is more than acceptable.

Cons
- This laptop does NOT come with Windows 11 Preinstalled. You need to install it on your own.
- During Windows 11 installation, I felt the laptop heating a bit, the heat seeps through the keyboard, and you feel it near the WASD keys. I didn't experience this issue during regular use though.
- If you charge the Laptop while using it, even for casual tasks, it takes a bit longer to charge.

To sum it up, if you want the Lenvo reliability and a good processor, all under 50K, this one is where your search ends.; Best product for daily office use; Sound quality is worst üò©.
Overall performance is good.; ; Good laptop in budget but if u want see it's real performance upgrade ram to 16gb buy and u can play pubg g in 1080p in 60 to 81 fps but I don't suggest it I just check and I have to video editing also only screen is con other than that everything is super in this budget"

Review after 1 month of use:

Processor:
-Ryzen 7530U is a best processor clubbed with 16GB RAM is very good for programming or running heavy applications.

Keyboard:
-I am not quite happy with the new keyboard in Gen 5 as compared to older gen. Lenovo says its more tactile but i feel it moved more towards chicket one which is not what a thinkpad user likes.

Webcam:
- Webcam could have been better. If there is a even a small light source opp. to the camera, images get very blur. In proper lighting it ok to use, but better to have a seperate webcam if your work requires frequent calls.

Battery:
- Battery backup is good for a window laptop. With Balanced setting it can easily last for 6-7 hours. Company claims 12 hrs which i feel is not possible and just a gimmick.

Display:
- Anti Glare screen is just amazing. you will love this if you are a developer and casual OTT consumer. However this is a IPS panel which i feel is the biggest upgrade from older gen thinkpads at this price range, but max brightness is slightly on the lower side of 250 nits. I may be feeling this slightly more i as i used Macbook Air M1 which has around 400 nits with retina display. Since this being built for professional use, i wouldn't recommend this for graphic designing or photoshop due to low colour accuracy in the display

Ports:
Having 2 USB Type C port in Gen 5 is a great plus. You get 2 high speed type a as well. Having Lan and HDMI port is a great relief compared to my Mac

Win 11 & Office:
Both comes pre installed and best part pre activated, you just need to link you office got and done.

Overall a great laptop for developers and normal OTT consumer. Value for money product with military grade design."

HP 14s is the one which I concluded at last . After 2 weeks of experience I'm writing this review. The laptop works in a smooth way without any glitches and trouble.

System Info :

Now lets see the pros and cons which I observed.

Pros : Super thin body with think Basel screen and super viewing experience. Light weight and will give you a good sound experience. Web came us fair enough for meetings. Good experience while coding, basic games ,videos, music, typing, and general office and personal use. Exhaust is designed according to the dynamics so the air flow will go upward via next to the screen without effecting the screen at all.

Cons : Could have equipped with a privacy shutter for web cam, One thump opening of display is not possible (Cuz of that the weight is not much ), CPU fan sometimes rotate high speed which make a little noise. CPU gets hot a little some time ( But gets normal immediately). Touch pad is plane so it sometime right click become left click if not careful enough.

Notes: its comes with 2 USB ports, 1 audio jack port, 1 HDMI port, 1 charging port,1 SD card slot. No finger print reader. But facials recognition is available. 120 degree screen screen adjustment (not 180 or 360 degrees), no touch.

So after considering all I experience this machine is really worth the value for money.; pathetic build quality ; the trackpad's ""polish"" got scratched somehow, and now it very uneven and such a terrible experience to use the trackpad. Also, a part of the screen got kind of damaged somehow, such it is a bit greyish in that region (probably a hardware problem) . Also, the lid is kind of tilted from the left end already, like within a year of usage. Absolutely terrible build quality.

Terrible performance as well. I used to get blue screen of death error atleast twice a day, until i got the ssd changed, that too which I had to get installed via 3rd party. Hp customer support and service center is also completely trash. They didn't get the ssd changed until the device was in warranty period ; they once got the ram changed (they told so, i don't even believe they did anything at all) in the warranty period, but it was of no use.

Moreover, when the delivery package arrived, the box was a bit damaged, due to which i wasn't able to get the complete serial number, so i wasn't able to extend the warranty.

Such a waste of time of money. Never buying HP products again"

This is good 14inch laptop, lightweight, with Ms office pre-installed. On board memory limited to 8gb is an issue if you use memory hogging programs. Audio quality very bad. Very low volume a big disappointment. Otherswise quality of the product is good as expected for ASUS. Battery life is better than the previous laptop guess it is due to lp processor and lpdram. Display is good and camera performance satisfactory. Keyboard and touchpad good.keyborad could have been backlite ü•∫my score is 3.5 mainly due to low volume.; I have recently bought the Asus Vivobook 16 and I must say it's a very good budget laptop for daily basic usage and especially for a student like me. It's Intel i3 1215u processor handles basic tasks like PPT presentation Excel and net surfing very easily. It also has a decent display of 16 inches to watch movies and videos on.
It also offers a fingerprint scanner which is a very good thing in a budget laptop. One thing which I think is missing is the backlit keyboard at this price point otherwise the laptop is very nice and I would recommend you to buy it for daily usage and basic gaming ( Not heavy games like pubg gta v etc); i had ordered this product last week and received bad product which was not switching on , had to return the laptop , had to go through lot of issues and 100s of calls to and fro between ASUS and Amazon , struggled to return , now am re-ordering lets see what i receive and now the product price has increased from 39990 to 40990 , amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! , first i received a faulty product and then i see the same product price is increased ... how shameful ... please dont send a faulty product this time AMAZON , pleaes dont harass customers also while returning the product; Pros
1. OLED Screen: Awesome screen. True to life media consumption.
2. Processor: 12th gen U category i3 processor. Battery efficient and powerful processor.
3. Ram : 16gb upgradable. More than enough ram for work ,productivity and games as well.
4. 90hz screen so very smooth experience

Cons
1. Battery last for 4-5 hours on normal usage.
2. Plastic built so use carefully.
3. Camera is 720p so not good for a lot of meetings.; According to the budget you get really good laptop. Considering the price it is value for money.
Pros:
1) The display is top notch feeling viewing angles are really good that will never disappoint you
2) it has decent battery capacity considering the high resolution screen it is giving me around 4.5hrs approximately
3) Processor and user interface is really fluid combined with that 90hz .....it is very good for day to day usages
Cons :
1) If you want a laptop with atleast mediocre sound quality this is not for you because the sound it produces is very very low you can't even hear to any songs or movies
2) so if you are willing to sacrifice the sound just for high resolution screen just go head if not just choose any other brand
People who loves sound just don't buy this one you can't even hear single thing from it
(For Sound ..........it is just waste of money don't buy I repeat don't even consider this laptop go for better sound producing laptops ); Laptop is sleek with good performance.
Everything is good but there's been heating issue while charging and using it at the same time. Battery backup is average.; I bought this product in Jan 2024, overall it's decent laptop in this price (for me 42k). I'm moderate user, not use any heavy software. My previous device was quite old (2014), so for me this one is really fast. It boots quickly and apps load in no time e.g. Gimp, Chrome.
Battery life is around 5 hours with internet.
Camera quality can be improved.
In 4 months usage I haven't faced any issues so far.; It's a good laptop with average display. The Wifi/Bluetooth modules doesn't work with Linux. Battery runs about 4 Hrs of normal browsing and multimedia playback.

The black 14 inch comes with Fingerprint sensor."

Speaker sound is very low.

Battery backup also not good.

Not worth for money.; What to say, its really nice product , the only thing I don't like is that its not metal body.. Rest everything is good.; Build quality issue; Let's be honest the quality of laptop is better than i expected if you are buying this laptop for programming it is the best option under 60k..one thing which disappointed me is there is no fingerprint scanner and the battery life is ok ok but overall the laptop is good(you can do thodi bhot gaming too); You will not able to look in to its display for 10 mins continuously. I have an another laptop with price less than 30000. Even its display is far better than this. This display don't know about black color. Heavy back light is there in the display. Configuration and performance wise it is good. But for working with this you may need to connect some other monitor.; After using the ASUS Vivobook 15 laptop for 7+ months, it's safe to say that this model has been a huge disappointment. Pehle istemaal kiya fir vishwaas kia.

I happily used my previous laptop from another brand for 7 years. My sister uses another ASUS laptop model that is priced almost half of this one, yet it performs better. The sound of this model is barely audible even when played at full volume when I play something on both laptops. Even my phone's volume is louder and better than this model. Its sound quality is subpar.

The Touchpad sensor does not allow me to select text. Selected text gets deselected on the way while I drag through the text. Sometimes on a single click, it selects the available word or line(magical feature). At times, upon a touchpad left click, options of a right click pop up.

In the name of a thin and light laptop, this model provides an unreliable body. I need to carefully hold it like a baby using both hands, otherwise, it makes a chit-chat sound.

With normal usage (no heavy jobs such as gaming), from day 1, it overheats within an hour. I was expecting better from ASUS. This model does not do justice to the ASUS brand.

If I leave this on sleep, using it again becomes nearly impossible. It takes approximately a minute for the letters I type to appear on the screen (I have Intel Core i7 12th Gen, 16GB).
To me, it's an undesirable model.

Despite my love for the ASUS brand, this purchase has left me feeling let down.; Nice laptop with Stylish appearance and
Sleek design. This process is good and starts within seconds.
The body is mostly plastic and is it comes with backlit keyboard with 3 different modes which makes easy to use while traveling and in dark; In the laptop shutdown button, not seperated. If any situation or human error cleck on shutdown button, pc shutdown"

There is no lag during browsing or opening new programs. MS office is pre-installed. I had my ID for the same so no need to download.

Overall really good buy at this price range.; I just received the product and packaging and all looks good; The laptop is good and functions well as expected in all areas. The rest of the feedback is quite similar to what others have written. Let me focus on something that I have experienced uniquely.

I bought this device on 31 Mar 2024, but when I checked the warranty instead of 12 months I found only 1 month of warranty was remaining. HP Customer Service said that the dealer must have purchased this device 1 year ago and hence the warranty is coming to an end. Now since 12 April 2024, I have been struggling with HP Customer Service to get proper 12 months of warranty for me. After numerous calls, emails, and escalation to the HP Service Head, I was finally able to get a complete 12 months of warranty.

This was a PATHETIC experience buying this HP device. The seller/dealer on Amazon must know about this kind of trouble the end customers are facing due to the expiring warranty on their dead stocks.; After 2 month my mother will damaged. but it will repaired .so don't purchase this produvt; I bought this product at 28000 for using on my college as student
It's okay
Even DaVinci Resolve worked okay
Fine

Looking at the brand which is still at its baby stage is making awesome product that too budget friendly people like me who are on a very tight budget should definitely go for this.

Students can go for this laptop.; I was in 2 minds whether to buy this or not after going through the reviews. Many people were complaining about the lappy over heating. It's common sense that there should proper vent out for the in-built fan to blow out the heat. If there is no vent, it's apparent that the machine over heats.

Dell needs to improve in this section.; I had a worst experience with this laptop. First I received defective laptop, and after 3 request attempt seller returned this item. It has been one month since I requested return for the first time, and still I'm chasing to get my refund. Overall I had a worst and irritating experience. I will never recommend anyone to buy the product from this seller.; Complete value for money product.
Ryzen 5 works as smooth as i5. Not very heavy, pretty compact and build quality is superb. Using it past 5 months, faced no issues at all. Highly recommended!!; i will review in 3 stages good ,avg and bad

Good:
Processor r5 3450u (get your daily work done)
ssd 256gb(but u will get around 150-155gb after all necessary updates)
screen (no dead pixel and no screen bleeding....brightness can be a issue if you work outside mostly)
microphone (captures super crystal voice good for work from home )
easy to carry lightweight laptop and design is also good

Average:
build quality (build quality near trackpad is so poor that when you put your palm on palm rest it will click any button of trackpad)
camera(just that much that people can recognize you)
keyboard(you have to sacrifice with num pad)
speaker(my phones speaker is louder than this)
trackpad(small in size)
dell mobile connect(it is just useless ....believe me you never going to use it )

Bad:
Heat(heat is going to be a part of your life...it heat even after 10-15min of browsing )
battery(i dont know why but i was not able to charge my laptop 100%...charging stuck at 91%)

conclusion
1.when you want laptop with ryzen 5 processor +ssd with brand name like dell then only you can consider it and ofcourse you are on tight budget...and it is not for gaming(you can play low end games)
2. attending classes and daily work can be done easily; Everything is nice except the over heating issue.; The model is a VOSTRO model. They did NOT make this clear in listing. For the uninitiated, Dell has multiple series of laptops - Vostro is entry level business use series where they cut corners (such as low end sound card, low end graphics etc), LATITUDE is mid end Corporate series and are much more tough and rugged, INSPIRON is targeted at home users for low end tasks, XPS (or Extreme Performance System) series is high end series for C-level execs, while Alienware is for Gaming. The laptop in question is ENTRY level VOSTRO and within that, it is starting level (series 3XXX). Sound card needs improvement, graphics card is average, Display is relatively low end. For Indian Rupees 32K, in Feb 2024, this is NOT a good deal. It should have been at least 5 k cheaper.; Dell Vostro 3405 , amd ryzen 5 , 8 gb ram upgradable , 512 ssd.
First impression is really good ,
looks and feel
- light and shiny ,
-Quality of plastic used could be improved , doubt if it can last for years
- touch pad is quite responsive, keyboard is excellent
boot time is under 10 secs , amazing combination of processor +ssd + windows 10 os+ mcafe av
I got 2000k cash back for effective prize came down by 3-4 k including discounts from credit card etc.
overall product is amazing at this price point .with upgradable ram upto 16 gb in future , 512 ssd is reasonable bargain at this price .
I would recommend this product for general use , with low or little gaming ,or less graphic intensive use .
specs are certainly good , but the body is plastic which casts doubts on longevity of device over time and general wear and tear.
Above all the support from Dell and Amazon support is great.
Thanks; Laptop is good but not the seller party. The laptop speaker is not working properly."

1) Performance is Top tier at this price. CPU will be a bottleneck in some cases as its a 13420H but will be fine for most used case scenarios.
2) Battery is OK
3) A little bit of false advertising saying it contains wifi 6E as shown in the attached photo but I checked and it has Wifi 6 Ax203. Most people won't notice the difference though.
4) Display is just ok. Can't complain at this price as all other laptops in this price segment give similar displays. Colors are really unnatural but in Display settings->Advanced Display-> Turn on ""Automatically manage colors for apps"". It will be fine after that.
5) Fans are loud yes but you can actually set custom speeds for fans easily, so I see no issue here. They are generally quiet when not gaming
6) Tried Cyberpunk 2077 at ultra and I must say it was a delight
7) No heating problems
8) Looks are nice, I wanted something which looks simple and basic but packs a punch under its hood, perfect for me
9) Lighter in weight than my previous laptop, no issues for me.
In the end- If performance is your priority, while also looking decent for office or college, it can be a really good choice. I heard i7 variant will launch soon and if that comes under 90k, it will be quite insane.
P.S- One thing I don't like is 512gb ssd only, If they had a option of 1tb at a little premium, it would be perfect. Well, atleast it's Gen 4.; Amazon customer accepted that they have given defective Product and always giving false hope of return and missing their own deadline.
Pathetic customer service. Not even top management acting on this.; ; Pro's :
1. It's value for money ( I am a btech student ) .
2. It's more portable and attractive than I had thought.
3. It's design in very classy ( not gaming one )
4. It is sturdy but not sure about its lifespan .
5. Beautiful keyboard with white backlight numpad and bigger trackpad.
6. No overheating.

Cons :
1. Battery life is awful üòû, sometimes it shows 1.8 hors battery left in 85% battery.
2. Sound quality is good but dts is just on but not making any difference at all, even Equalizer is not working , it looks like a gimmick.

Overall display is average and manageable , it does not let it down ,

But , if you want better build with 90 whrs battery life , Dolby audio , mux switch, etc and especially gaming looks , go for Asus tuf 15 i5 12500h rtx 3050

And if you want a professional looking laptop with better internal specs and don't do gaming that much like me ( use for btech ) , you should go for it.; Awesome product, good performance and worth buying it.good build quality,
Good battery life and camera is also better,
Value for money.; This is a great budget laptop. I managed to get it for just under 71k during the Diwali sale. In my opinion, this device offers the best specs for its price range in the current market. There aren't many laptops in this price range that offer an RTX 4050. So, without any hesitation, I would recommend going for it. The performance is excellent; you can run every AAA title on very high to maximum settings. Even some unoptimized games will run smoothly. The display is decent, and the battery backup is satisfactory, although gaming is recommended while plugged in for maximum performance. One minor issue I found was the placement of the heat sink, right above the keyboard, which heats up a lot after a gaming session of 2-3 hours. But I believe it's manageable; after all, which gaming laptop doesn't heat up? Overall, apart from 1-2 compromises, this laptop is a beast at this price point.; Purchased it for Graphics intensive work like CAD and Designing. Works well."

Looking at the brand which is still at its baby stage is making awesome product that too budget friendly people like me who are on a very tight budget should definitely go for this. Don't always go by the big brand guys there are smaller brands as well who are waiting to explode and make history. Just look at the features of the product and compare the prices with the other brands and that's what a smart buyer does.; ; Battery takes over 12 hours to fully charge and discharges in 2 hours of usage. This is unexpected as the product description claims something else. Other features are ok; Laptop is very light, processor is good according to its price. Overall value for its price.; Laptop is okay for price, u can't expect a sturdy laptop for price under 30k, but there is lot of room for improvement, trackpad is not accurate, Audio volume is on the lower side, laptop gets heat up quickly.
So we know where cost cutting was done.
Students can go for this laptop.; I was in 2 minds whether to buy this or not after going through the reviews. Many people were complaining about the lappy over heating. It's common sense that there should proper vent out for the in-built fan to blow out the heat. If there is no vent, it's apparent that the machine over heats.

POV: It's a perfect laptop at this price for general usage, mid range gaming and for core coding.; Battry very poor quality pls don't buy this product

Overall an good buy for me and upgrade.; So, i received a defective product, it was overheating and had software defects. When I approached Amazon Cust care because I couldn't get in touch with HP they suggested that I return it because it seemed liked a defective product to them and offered me refund, since there was no replacement option available.. since they are the experts, i agreed.

After 2 weeks to to and fro the product finally got picked up on 26th September 2023.

When I contacted Amazon regarding the refund on 1st October, i was told that they have received an incorrect product and hence I won't be getting a refund.

So, i am down 50 k and the laptop as well. Their customer care is refusing to even speak to me or discuss this matter.

I mean, Amazon doesn't pick up a product without verification at the time of return. So either they lost it in transit or their pick up agent did something.

Anyhow, This has left me scarred for life wity regards to shopping online.

Thanks Amazon, for teaching me a lesson about shopping online.; I have been using this convertible laptop for the last three weeks. Nice.Battery backup is not that good. May be it's touch screen. Otherwise I am satisfied; Overheating during charging it is only the problem otherwise it's good in all features"

Dell needs to improve in this section.; I had a worst experience with this laptop. First I received defective laptop, and after 3 request attempt seller returned this item. It has been one month since I requested return for the first time, and still I'm chasing to get my refund. Overall I had a worst and irritating experience. I will never recommend anyone to buy the product from this seller.; Complete value for money product.
Ryzen 5 works as smooth as i5. Not very heavy, pretty compact and build quality is superb. Using it past 5 months, faced no issues at all. Highly recommended!!; i will review in 3 stages good ,avg and bad

Good:
Processor r5 3450u (get your daily work done)
ssd 256gb(but u will get around 150-155gb after all necessary updates)
screen (no dead pixel and no screen bleeding....brightness can be a issue if you work outside mostly)
microphone (captures super crystal voice good for work from home )
easy to carry lightweight laptop and design is also good

Average:
build quality (build quality near trackpad is so poor that when you put your palm on palm rest it will click any button of trackpad)
camera(just that much that people can recognize you)
keyboard(you have to sacrifice with num pad)
speaker(my phones speaker is louder than this)
trackpad(small in size)
dell mobile connect(it is just useless ....believe me you never going to use it )

Bad:
Heat(heat is going to be a part of your life...it heat even after 10-15min of browsing )
battery(i dont know why but i was not able to charge my laptop 100%...charging stuck at 91%)

conclusion
1.when you want laptop with ryzen 5 processor +ssd with brand name like dell then only you can consider it and ofcourse you are on tight budget...and it is not for gaming(you can play low end games)
2. attending classes and daily work can be done easily; Everything is nice except the over heating issue.; The model is a VOSTRO model. They did NOT make this clear in listing. For the uninitiated, Dell has multiple series of laptops - Vostro is entry level business use series where they cut corners (such as low end sound card, low end graphics etc), LATITUDE is mid end Corporate series and are much more tough and rugged, INSPIRON is targeted at home users for low end tasks, XPS (or Extreme Performance System) series is high end series for C-level execs, while Alienware is for Gaming. The laptop in question is ENTRY level VOSTRO and within that, it is starting level (series 3XXX). Sound card needs improvement, graphics card is average, Display is relatively low end. For Indian Rupees 32K, in Feb 2024, this is NOT a good deal. It should have been at least 5 k cheaper.; Dell Vostro 3405 , amd ryzen 5 , 8 gb ram upgradable , 512 ssd.
First impression is really good ,
looks and feel
- light and shiny ,
-Quality of plastic used could be improved , doubt if it can last for years
- touch pad is quite responsive, keyboard is excellent
boot time is under 10 secs , amazing combination of processor +ssd + windows 10 os+ mcafe av
I got 2000k cash back for effective prize came down by 3-4 k including discounts from credit card etc.
overall product is amazing at this price point .with upgradable ram upto 16 gb in future , 512 ssd is reasonable bargain at this price .
I would recommend this product for general use , with low or little gaming ,or less graphic intensive use .
specs are certainly good , but the body is plastic which casts doubts on longevity of device over time and general wear and tear.
Above all the support from Dell and Amazon support is great.
Thanks; Laptop is good but not the seller party. The laptop speaker is not working properly."

Here are a few things I enjoy and don't like.

The Thinkbook was the last model I saw while I was shopping for a laptop to buy, and I kind of loved all the specs in this price range. When compared to every other brand with the same specifications, this appeared to be a great deal.

I didn't know this till after I bought the laptop, but out of all the features I appreciate, the speaker is among the worst. For the past two years, I have been using my friend's HP laptop, which has the best speaker ever‚Äîit produces great sound even when it is only half loud. Please cross this laptop off the list if you're searching for one with nice speakers.

I've now noticed that the screen brightness is the next drawback. In all of the screens, I always use the lowest possible screen brightness. I would always use '0' on the same HP laptop because that is my ideal brightness level; however, with this laptop, I had to use at least two levels.

Other than the two drawbacks mentioned above, I haven't had any difficulties. Once I've used it for a while, I'll update the long-term review.

If any of you utilize this laptop, kindly share any positive and negative aspects with us.; This product for suppose to be a gift for my mom but turned to be a nightmare. Ever this product was delivered my mom has been trying to turn the new piece on but the display shows a blank a screen. Just a heads up the battery is fully charged. On speaking with amazon they said have a word with Lenovo on it.
Lenovo has been throwing tantrums that contact the supplier. It seems that nobody is ready to take the responsibility and busy playing blame games. Lenovo promised to send technician on calling Monday morning but I get a simple email from them that the serial number doesn‚Äôt match the invoice hence contact supplier. Though over the call they did say that the technician will come over and check the invoice soft copy. My parents are in their 60‚Äôs Amazon take up the responsibility and issue a replacement. As it‚Äôs not my parents mistake that the product turned out to be defective but they are facing the consequences for it.; I think that this is the cheapest laptop with a Ryzen 7730U Processor, 8 GB RAM and a Fingerprint Sensor. I purchased this for my father, who likes his gadgets to be as future-proof as possible. This laptop is priced at under 50K, and at that you get a sturdy workhorse of a machine.

Pros
- Very sturdy build. Laptop looks so pleasant and elegant.
- Keyboard is classic Lenovo. Very good typing experience, backlight is available in 3 modes: off, low and high.
- Up gradability: You can add another RAM, and the 512GB SSD can be swapped for a 1TB in the long run.
- Charges using USB port, but doesn't charge via phone/tablet chargers. I tried my 33W Xiaomi Adapter as well as my OnePlus 100W Adapter. Neither worked. But the laptop's charger charges my phone and tablet just fine. It's a good option as it charges in 4 Voltages: 5V, 9V, 15V and 20V.
- Fingerprint Sensor works like a charm.
- Webcam is more than acceptable.

Cons
- This laptop does NOT come with Windows 11 Preinstalled. You need to install it on your own.
- During Windows 11 installation, I felt the laptop heating a bit, the heat seeps through the keyboard, and you feel it near the WASD keys. I didn't experience this issue during regular use though.
- If you charge the Laptop while using it, even for casual tasks, it takes a bit longer to charge.

Best laptop.; Excellent laptop.

Pros :

- Excellent OLED display
- MSOffice was provided along with the package
- Laptop body is sturdy and not clunky like ASUS TUF laptops.

Cons :

- one massive con, being the harmann/kardon speaker.

The speaker outlet is kept at the bottom of the laptop, this it gets muffled when kept on a couch or bed. There was enough room at the top of the laptop to build the speaker outlet, however wasn't utilised.

I had to change/reinstall, burn the audio drivers of this laptop, make tweaks in the control panel in order to get the speakers to a audible level. Disappointed with the speakers.

To fix the speakers

- Use the realtek audio driver
- install all the latest windows patches
- In control panel - sounds - enable audio enhancements
- play music at 200% on VLC media player for an hour so that the drivers burn
- restart laptop and check; Working fine. Speaker Soud a bit low. All purpose thin and light laptop.
Constantly browsing internet for 8hr, still battery wasn't empty. Having Great experience. @60.8k; Guys be alert, 7 days service centre return on laptops is false commitment . Neither Asus agrees to it nor Amazon once you get a defective laptop. Your mental harassment starts from there. Keep calling asus customer care and Amazon customer care and every time new information will be given to you. Most irritating part is talking to Amazon customer care,they don't provide correct info and say that they will try to do this and that as if there is no guidelines or policy defined for returning defective laptops. On top of that Amazon customer care lied and asked for permission on my account to view product details and they disconnected call and now I am unable to file return for that product.
Guys be alert, I am still not sure whether mine laptop return will take place but it's very lengthy process. Steps involved :
1.self diagnosis to find out issue.
2.call Amazon customer care which will provide wrong information to visit nearest Asus service centre and it will be replaced there.
3.Asus service centre says that they never replace product . They issue D. O. A letter which needs to be sent to seller. Most important they counts 7days from date of invoice not date of delivery. So think twice.
4.Asus customer care will also tell same thing but they are not taking initiative to check why is mentioned 7days service centre replacement by amazon while selling product.
5.wait for another 4-5 days to get letter from Asus service center.
6.Try to connect to Amazon customer care
To be continued once I am able to complete step 5.; I've only been using this for a week, but the screen is gorgeous and the battery life is also really good, so far. The aspect ratio seems to be a missed opportunity. It should've been 16:10, instead of 16:9. It does make for great a movie viewing experience though. Speakers are average, and almost useless in even slightly noisy environments. Haven't installed any games yet, so can't comment on gaming performance, but I have opened chrome with 10+ tabs, along with several explorer windows and a couple of other applications in the background, and i didn't notice any lag or drop in performance yet. I wanted to get the Quiet Blue and not the silver, but it was out of stock. However, i think the silver is growing on me. The keyboard lights do tend to make the keys unreadable under certain lighting conditions, and i have to manually reduce/increase the brightness to be able to see the letters again. The embossed logo on the lid makes it difficult to find a compatible laptop skin for it though, and that's a bummer. Guess i'll have to get a laptop sleeve instead, to protect it from scratches while it's in the bag with other stuff.; ; If you are looking for a gaming and productivity laptop got for this one.it manages every kind of task. I have used this laptop for 4 to 5 days and I don't have any issues regarding its performance.; My son bought it for his B.Tech AI ML related job and he is very satisfied with the performance. Excellent battery life and fast processing."

Firstly, I did notice mild electric current when the laptop is charging but it is only at metal surface which top of screen - i dont touch it anyway :)

Here is my feedback per feature:

Usage - i use this laptop atleast 3-4hours a day for productivity purposes - i dont play games and i mainly use it for programming

Build quality - The laptop looks great initially however after some time the usage marks on keyboard, touchpad appear quickly, the hinges which hold the screen could have been improved, the screen falls down if it at a certain angle and is not firm
Although it says metal body but feels plastic all over.

Keyboard - this full keyboard is missing one column in the number pad - usually the last column contains + - and enter key but they have omitted that here and it will take sometime to get used to. In short keyboard is not full. However overall it is ok to type to - there is ample space for wrist support.

Heat dissipation - the Fans are right at the bottom and they make a lot of noise when laptop is heated - you will need a cooling pad to keep this laptop cool and if you plan work on your lap wear insulated clothing - in short this laptop cant work on a lap :)

Fingerprint - it is new feature for me in laptop and it works sometimes and sometimes it doesnt

Video / Audio - No complaints.

Battery - With the apps which i run i get 1.5-2hours of backup easily however i assume this would go down eventually but i don't mind keeping it plugged in

Cost - I dont think this laptop is made for rough use - if taken enough care this would survive for years and this configuration at 31k is definitely value for money - similar configuration is minimum 10k more

Lastly, i will recommend this laptop for students and people like me who are on a budget; Display is good but hinge loose but ok and built quality looks average, keyboard is kind of low quality,looks sleek and weight less, with a poor battery life, Fan sounds noisy but speaker sound is good comparitively and also heating too much but liberation of heat via body and fan too poor.charging time is too bad but c type charger is provided and all the port are too tight ... the USB ports and hdmi port. A bit on slow side.It feels like a low quality product with good style and sleek look.This is my personal opinion on the device after using for a while buying it or not is all upto you.; The zebronic I7 model I purchased through Amazon and it worth me nearly half a lakh and they cheated me by giving the refurbished where the product keys are mis matched like @ is mis matched with apostrophy "" and few other keys are not working and using for 1p min it's burning like fire and the processer named high and it's very slow and says quick charging but very slow and the performance are nothing totally got cheated by Amazon because I trust Amazon and buy. They cheated me; Super performance with i7 ,display-10/10
Great build ,looks classy,best things is its with dolby ,I watched movie and sound effect is just awesome, while purchasing I had the fear being this is new brand ,was having 2nd thought too ,but after getting product..decision of buying this was rt..all i can say just go fr it.; Pros:-
i7-12gen
1tb ssd (SATA roughly 100 mbits/s speed)
16 gb ram
Zebronics motherboard
Cons :-
SSD , RAM - chinese brand not of well known brands,
Fingerprint Reader sometimes become unresponsive
SSD provided is of sata which is a joke in this price segment must have pci express rather than sata , ssd name is nmve but it does support high speed data transfer
Ram chinese brand
Of course battery the most worst thing of it non removable , 2 hrs backup for playing online videos and surfing internet , if you used heavy task 1 hr is max because fans are running , charging time is dreadful 3-4 hrs charging whether you use in background or not‚Ä¶..
Wifi 5- which means you dont get wifi 6 which is todays need and next gen support.
Usb C common platform for charging the device , if you use by chance in phone then no one is responsible

Final verdict:-
Price is high according to specs providers .
Build quality is below par.Display quality is below par.Ram is average.SSD is below par.
Go with other brands like MSI you will get better specs interms of connection dont get fooled here.; Best part of this laptop is performance and speed. You can do multitasking and Can edit videos. Photoshop is working very smooth and All editing software's are working excellent. webcam quality was pretty good.

Coming to drawbacks Battery was week. Draining very fast and to charge 100%, it is taking minimum of 4hrs. build quality of keyboard and complete edges of laptop was very poor. It wont seems work for long time.

Pros:
Performance
Value for money
High end software's working smoothly
webcam

cons:
Battery
Build quality
Keyboard; Hi this sai sundeep. I was sharing my happiness of purchasing budget friendly cost with high configurations. I am totally satisfied with design and performance thanks to zebronics team it's a great design with sound quality is to good with dolby support.; Just bought 3-daya back.. received in good condition... Performance very good for day today works. But lack many little little features which reputed brands like HP, Dell, Lenovo etc provide like backlit Keys, scroll on touch pad, better front camera/webcam , detachable battery, Microsoft Office etc. The only advantage is it's i7 processor with 16 GB RAM, 1TB ROM and economic cost. Battery back up 3-5 hrs depending on use... let's see after few months"

Here are a few things I enjoy and don't like.

The Thinkbook was the last model I saw while I was shopping for a laptop to buy, and I kind of loved all the specs in this price range. When compared to every other brand with the same specifications, this appeared to be a great deal.

I didn't know this till after I bought the laptop, but out of all the features I appreciate, the speaker is among the worst. For the past two years, I have been using my friend's HP laptop, which has the best speaker ever‚Äîit produces great sound even when it is only half loud. Please cross this laptop off the list if you're searching for one with nice speakers.

I've now noticed that the screen brightness is the next drawback. In all of the screens, I always use the lowest possible screen brightness. I would always use '0' on the same HP laptop because that is my ideal brightness level; however, with this laptop, I had to use at least two levels.

Other than the two drawbacks mentioned above, I haven't had any difficulties. Once I've used it for a while, I'll update the long-term review.

If any of you utilize this laptop, kindly share any positive and negative aspects with us.; This product for suppose to be a gift for my mom but turned to be a nightmare. Ever this product was delivered my mom has been trying to turn the new piece on but the display shows a blank a screen. Just a heads up the battery is fully charged. On speaking with amazon they said have a word with Lenovo on it.
Lenovo has been throwing tantrums that contact the supplier. It seems that nobody is ready to take the responsibility and busy playing blame games. Lenovo promised to send technician on calling Monday morning but I get a simple email from them that the serial number doesn‚Äôt match the invoice hence contact supplier. Though over the call they did say that the technician will come over and check the invoice soft copy. My parents are in their 60‚Äôs Amazon take up the responsibility and issue a replacement. As it‚Äôs not my parents mistake that the product turned out to be defective but they are facing the consequences for it.; I think that this is the cheapest laptop with a Ryzen 7730U Processor, 8 GB RAM and a Fingerprint Sensor. I purchased this for my father, who likes his gadgets to be as future-proof as possible. This laptop is priced at under 50K, and at that you get a sturdy workhorse of a machine.

Pros
- Very sturdy build. Laptop looks so pleasant and elegant.
- Keyboard is classic Lenovo. Very good typing experience, backlight is available in 3 modes: off, low and high.
- Up gradability: You can add another RAM, and the 512GB SSD can be swapped for a 1TB in the long run.
- Charges using USB port, but doesn't charge via phone/tablet chargers. I tried my 33W Xiaomi Adapter as well as my OnePlus 100W Adapter. Neither worked. But the laptop's charger charges my phone and tablet just fine. It's a good option as it charges in 4 Voltages: 5V, 9V, 15V and 20V.
- Fingerprint Sensor works like a charm.
- Webcam is more than acceptable.

Cons
- This laptop does NOT come with Windows 11 Preinstalled. You need to install it on your own.
- During Windows 11 installation, I felt the laptop heating a bit, the heat seeps through the keyboard, and you feel it near the WASD keys. I didn't experience this issue during regular use though.
- If you charge the Laptop while using it, even for casual tasks, it takes a bit longer to charge.

work smoothly; Initially I was worried about the product quality and durability, but I am very much happy with its performance. I am writing this review after using the laptop for six months.
I gifted to my son on his birthday. He is
doing Mass Communication degree and has lot of work of Video edit, graphics, Photoshop etc but he never complained about its performance.
Also it is not too heavy as it's peer product.
I would definitely recommend to the students and graphic users.; It's been only 10 days since it got delivered and the screen bleeding issue is increasing day by day
The product software experience is great and the laptop manages to do most of the work pretty smoothly

ISSUE- The issue lies in display and battery life
-- With an i5 H-series processor and a graphics card the battery life has to be compromised It's hard to accept but it is what it is
-- The main issue comes with display quality In my unit there is a significant screen bleeding issue and as the day passes the bleeding keeps increasing

It's been 10 days so I'm not eligible for a replacement I tried to contact the ASUS technical service and they responded that I'm eligible for a repair. let's see how things go, Hope that it will be fixed

If your unity has a problem like this or anything else apply for a replacement ASAP otherwise it will be hard to get service or claim a warranty

It's pretty disappointing to see a brand like Asus have a problem like this; The laptop simply couldn't update vital security files. The defender keeps giving virus alerts in a brand new laptop. Simple softwares like ms office won't run.
Amazon won't even replace the device within 24 hrs of delivery. I gotta go to the asus service centre..... so guys it's better u buy from the showroom and have your laptop installed then n there. Save yourself from this inconvenience; I was looking for laptops which will have high performance series processor for multitasking. Great for coding also I was having hesitation of screen bleeding and all other stuff while buying online cause that issue can't be known until delivered but the way package delivered was satisfied. So don't worry about that issue if found contact them . Didn't know about gaming not tried yet will add later backlight keyboard is there with 3 level of adjustments. Display is good for movies,
Fingerprint is fast, Battery backup is decent. That's all I can say all good at this price....!; It has great display, powerful CPU, usable GPU and just the right balnce between weight and battery backup( which is abt 4-5 hrs on normal use)"

I mean fine it's a 4k 144hz and 2TB ssd and 64GB ram, like I get it's top of the line but why would they even think to come up with their stealth series chassis. It's low quality and intel needs pretty good cooling on their CPUs. But that's not the worst part it's a 13900h processor. There've been some serious obnoxious trade offs here. Ok here comes typical MSI it's a 4080!!! I mean a 4080 for 4 lakhs, no no just no. A 4080 yeah a 4080 for the same price of a 4090. You know just go for the scar 18, unless you really really need a pre installed 2TB ssd and 64GB of memory I suggest a 4090 with a 13980HX CPU will certainly make you forget you ever needed one. I mean you can always upgrade it. Plus the scar is a QHD+ 240Hz so it makes more sense to game on that.

Look I'm not picking sides but CLEARLY their is a clean victory here. I have a suggestion for MSI unless they really want a market share in gaming industry and not only in India but all over the world they need some serious change in production decisions. A middle class family here in India can buy a CAR and probly buy enough fuel for it to run for 8 months and could still buy a thin and light laptop for 4 lakhs. It's time we look to items of luxury and entertainment by such means. Yeah I know only filthy rich people can even afford to look at these laptops but it dosen't do you any good that even a child would know not to buy this laptop and rather buy an ASUS scar 18 or 16.; A very good laptop.

People were saying that it has battery drain issue, but I found it good. The Battery lasts around 5hrs in normal work including photoshop. The body is strong, design is good. I loved the display.

I was confused between the Infinix one and this one, but this one is much better as Lenovo has broader service area.; I've had it for just over 24 hours now and I've been putting under all kinds of stress tests and benchmarking tests to ensure there is no throttling or defects of any kind - so far everything works as expected. The display is definitely good (better than equivalent ASUS models). Will have to use it for a while to comment about its battery performance. The Lenovo vantage app didn't work at first, but a quick uninstall and reinstall fixed the issue and from there on I was able to fully test all three performance modes. The display has very minor backlight bleed towards the bottom, the rest appears just like regular IPS glow to me. The trackpad is pretty good. As far as games go, I've only tried Rocket League so far. Will update after trying some AAA titles in a week or so.

Update: I've had it for 2 weeks now. Just want to post a quick update. The device has been great so far. It handles anything you throw at it effortlessly plus it stays relatively cool even when put it under stress (games, rendering etc.). I use a basic vertically elevated cooling pad with shitty fans and for me the CPU temps have never gone beyond 87-88 degrees even with air conditioning turned off. On cooler days or with A/C on, the CPU temps (under stress) with cooling pad stay right below 80. Battery backup for normal tasks is 4-6 hours. At this point, the only drawback I feel is the lack of extra USB ports - it has just 2 (might have to use a hub if you've got more USB devices to connect).; So this is my second gaming laptop, first one being the Legion Y520 (i5 7th gen, GTX 1050). That laptop lasted 6 years for me and is currently being used by my sister.

Few reasons why I opted for this laptop in particular:
CPU and GPU combination - Ryzen 7 5800H, RTX 3060 @90W TDP
Display - 165Hz, 100% SRGB
Price: Got it for 89,990

Originally I wanted the MSI Alpha 15 Advantage edition that has the same CPU, but comes with 8GB Radeon 6600M. It was slightly expensive and delivery by Flipkart was quite slow for my address, so I didn't go for it. There were 2 other options from MSI that have RTX 3060 and shipped with i7 CPU, but they did not have color accurate displays (45% color gamut). For these reasons Ideapad gaming 3 became the perfect pick for me and I am impressed with my purchase. Boot times are of course great and games load significantly fast, of course. I am planning to add a 1TB SSD and additional 16GB RAM later which will improve the performance even further!

Following games have been tested by me so far on ultra to medium settings:
World of Warships - average FPS 100-120 @ ultra settings
Witcher 3 - 60 FPS on ultra settings. For some reason the FPS for this game are locked at 60
A Plague Tale: Innocence - 90-120 FPS on medium to ultra settings
Forza Horizon 4 - did not have FPS enable at that time so could not see the actual FPS, but it looked great so I'll assume it was in the range mentioned above

I am planning to try out more games and will update my review accordingly. But so far I am happy with my purchase and can recommend this laptop to future buyers with confidence. Trackpad is quite awesome too, don't know though which driver it is using. Keyboard is great as well, but I use an external keyboard anyway so it does not matter to me. Speakers are satisfactory. They are placed at the bottom and deliver good sound both in terms of quality and loudness.

The device is surprisingly lightweight which is a good thing! Build quality could have been better, but it is definitely not fragile. Keyboard is white backlit only, so no RGB lighting available. I am not into the fancy RGB lighting so it does not bother me at all. I am also thankful that it does not come with red lighting on the keyboard!

Thank you Amazon for quick delivery (16 hours) and thank you Lenovo for this good product.

Edit: I forgot the mention that I played for three hours straight and did not experience any kind of performance throttling. Boot up is almost instant which is expected. Note that it comes with 1x 16GB RAM and my laptop came with WD SN530 SSD. You have one more slot for RAM and SSD each and I've read somewhere that the laptop can support NVMe Gen 4 SSDs, but not sure whether that's true.; All are good; Edit:
DONT BE FOOLED BY 2 RAM SLOTS

IT CAN TAKE A MAX IF 16GB RAM. SO THE ONLY UPGRADE POSSIBLE FOR THE 1x16GB MODEL IS CHANGING IT TO DUAL CHANNEL 2x8GB.

Found out the hard and sad way, also confirmed with Lenovo.

Old:

The other review covers it very well, it will run whatever you throw at it.

I left Red Dead Redemption 2 running for 20 hours straight. resumed playing still ran like butter.

It comes with 2nd NVME slot but no screw so you'll have to procure it separately.

Others count lack of RGB as a con, but I'll say White looks professional, wich goes with the overall look of the laptop, making it suitable for use in professional environments if you don't want everyone around you knowing you're a gamer.

not being able to charge via the USB C is understandable with 170 W in the adaptor.

90W TDP is boost TPG it will show lower but boosts it to 90W. remains cool without throttling even for longer heavy workloads, hint 20hours of RDR2.

I recommend buying a 2nd NVME along with your purchase as you'll run out of 500 gigs quick.
The included disk is a WD BLue SN530, not the best but good performance, not something you'll find slow in your daily usage unless your work is copying > 200 gig everyday.

2Gig of the 16GB included ram go to VRAM ."

Review after 1 month of use:

Processor:
-Ryzen 7530U is a best processor clubbed with 16GB RAM is very good for programming or running heavy applications.

Keyboard:
-I am not quite happy with the new keyboard in Gen 5 as compared to older gen. Lenovo says its more tactile but i feel it moved more towards chicket one which is not what a thinkpad user likes.

Webcam:
- Webcam could have been better. If there is a even a small light source opp. to the camera, images get very blur. In proper lighting it ok to use, but better to have a seperate webcam if your work requires frequent calls.

Battery:
- Battery backup is good for a window laptop. With Balanced setting it can easily last for 6-7 hours. Company claims 12 hrs which i feel is not possible and just a gimmick.

Display:
- Anti Glare screen is just amazing. you will love this if you are a developer and casual OTT consumer. However this is a IPS panel which i feel is the biggest upgrade from older gen thinkpads at this price range, but max brightness is slightly on the lower side of 250 nits. I may be feeling this slightly more i as i used Macbook Air M1 which has around 400 nits with retina display. Since this being built for professional use, i wouldn't recommend this for graphic designing or photoshop due to low colour accuracy in the display

Ports:
Having 2 USB Type C port in Gen 5 is a great plus. You get 2 high speed type a as well. Having Lan and HDMI port is a great relief compared to my Mac

Win 11 & Office:
Both comes pre installed and best part pre activated, you just need to link you office got and done.

Overall a great laptop for developers and normal OTT consumer. Value for money product with military grade design."

People were saying that it has battery drain issue, but I found it good. The Battery lasts around 5hrs in normal work including photoshop. The body is strong, design is good. I loved the display.

I was confused between the Infinix one and this one, but this one is much better as Lenovo has broader service area.; I've had it for just over 24 hours now and I've been putting under all kinds of stress tests and benchmarking tests to ensure there is no throttling or defects of any kind - so far everything works as expected. The display is definitely good (better than equivalent ASUS models). Will have to use it for a while to comment about its battery performance. The Lenovo vantage app didn't work at first, but a quick uninstall and reinstall fixed the issue and from there on I was able to fully test all three performance modes. The display has very minor backlight bleed towards the bottom, the rest appears just like regular IPS glow to me. The trackpad is pretty good. As far as games go, I've only tried Rocket League so far. Will update after trying some AAA titles in a week or so.

Update: I've had it for 2 weeks now. Just want to post a quick update. The device has been great so far. It handles anything you throw at it effortlessly plus it stays relatively cool even when put it under stress (games, rendering etc.). I use a basic vertically elevated cooling pad with shitty fans and for me the CPU temps have never gone beyond 87-88 degrees even with air conditioning turned off. On cooler days or with A/C on, the CPU temps (under stress) with cooling pad stay right below 80. Battery backup for normal tasks is 4-6 hours. At this point, the only drawback I feel is the lack of extra USB ports - it has just 2 (might have to use a hub if you've got more USB devices to connect).; So this is my second gaming laptop, first one being the Legion Y520 (i5 7th gen, GTX 1050). That laptop lasted 6 years for me and is currently being used by my sister.

Few reasons why I opted for this laptop in particular:
CPU and GPU combination - Ryzen 7 5800H, RTX 3060 @90W TDP
Display - 165Hz, 100% SRGB
Price: Got it for 89,990

Originally I wanted the MSI Alpha 15 Advantage edition that has the same CPU, but comes with 8GB Radeon 6600M. It was slightly expensive and delivery by Flipkart was quite slow for my address, so I didn't go for it. There were 2 other options from MSI that have RTX 3060 and shipped with i7 CPU, but they did not have color accurate displays (45% color gamut). For these reasons Ideapad gaming 3 became the perfect pick for me and I am impressed with my purchase. Boot times are of course great and games load significantly fast, of course. I am planning to add a 1TB SSD and additional 16GB RAM later which will improve the performance even further!

Following games have been tested by me so far on ultra to medium settings:
World of Warships - average FPS 100-120 @ ultra settings
Witcher 3 - 60 FPS on ultra settings. For some reason the FPS for this game are locked at 60
A Plague Tale: Innocence - 90-120 FPS on medium to ultra settings
Forza Horizon 4 - did not have FPS enable at that time so could not see the actual FPS, but it looked great so I'll assume it was in the range mentioned above

I am planning to try out more games and will update my review accordingly. But so far I am happy with my purchase and can recommend this laptop to future buyers with confidence. Trackpad is quite awesome too, don't know though which driver it is using. Keyboard is great as well, but I use an external keyboard anyway so it does not matter to me. Speakers are satisfactory. They are placed at the bottom and deliver good sound both in terms of quality and loudness.

The device is surprisingly lightweight which is a good thing! Build quality could have been better, but it is definitely not fragile. Keyboard is white backlit only, so no RGB lighting available. I am not into the fancy RGB lighting so it does not bother me at all. I am also thankful that it does not come with red lighting on the keyboard!

Thank you Amazon for quick delivery (16 hours) and thank you Lenovo for this good product.

Edit: I forgot the mention that I played for three hours straight and did not experience any kind of performance throttling. Boot up is almost instant which is expected. Note that it comes with 1x 16GB RAM and my laptop came with WD SN530 SSD. You have one more slot for RAM and SSD each and I've read somewhere that the laptop can support NVMe Gen 4 SSDs, but not sure whether that's true.; All are good; Edit:
DONT BE FOOLED BY 2 RAM SLOTS

IT CAN TAKE A MAX IF 16GB RAM. SO THE ONLY UPGRADE POSSIBLE FOR THE 1x16GB MODEL IS CHANGING IT TO DUAL CHANNEL 2x8GB.

Found out the hard and sad way, also confirmed with Lenovo.

Old:

The other review covers it very well, it will run whatever you throw at it.

I left Red Dead Redemption 2 running for 20 hours straight. resumed playing still ran like butter.

It comes with 2nd NVME slot but no screw so you'll have to procure it separately.

Others count lack of RGB as a con, but I'll say White looks professional, wich goes with the overall look of the laptop, making it suitable for use in professional environments if you don't want everyone around you knowing you're a gamer.

not being able to charge via the USB C is understandable with 170 W in the adaptor.

90W TDP is boost TPG it will show lower but boosts it to 90W. remains cool without throttling even for longer heavy workloads, hint 20hours of RDR2.

I recommend buying a 2nd NVME along with your purchase as you'll run out of 500 gigs quick.
The included disk is a WD BLue SN530, not the best but good performance, not something you'll find slow in your daily usage unless your work is copying > 200 gig everyday.

2Gig of the 16GB included ram go to VRAM ."

Initially, it was not powering up. Battery was dead, but charging it brought it back to life. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have much time to explore it because it had other issues as well‚Äîspecifically, the display was faulty.
I promptly complained to Amazon, and the situation escalated from there:

On May 15th -
no one from Amazon or pick up service showed up and the scheduled pickup was canceled citing verification failure .
After contacting customer service, they assured me it wasn‚Äôt a major issue and rescheduled the pickup while registering a complaint against the pickup service.

The next pickup date was May 17th-
but once again, no one came to pick up the laptop. Surprisingly, I received a notification stating that the pickup was denied by the customer, which never happened.

On May 20th, the same scenario repeated, and a new pickup date was assigned.

Unfortunately, on May 21st, no pickup occurred because no one showed up.

Now, despite all these events, the customer service team claims that internal checks reveal the pickup was denied by me, and they won‚Äôt take any further action since the product was deemed to be in good condition.""; ; Liked It; Worst service by Amazon got defective piece can‚Äôt return or replace just get repair only misbehaving technician named Aditya something got help by dell so highly recommended not to buy from online; Facing Heating Issues
Battery Backup is also poor
Power adapter is not fitting into normal socket needs Refrigerator/AC power socket to charge
Worst part is Amazon not returning it without visiting Dell Service Center and letter that they can't solve your issue, which is not going to happen.
So Please be aware of it before you purchase it; I have received laptop without user manual. Also screen is flickering. Please return this laptop as i am sure it is refurbished product; Extreme Over heating problem, irritating fan noise on very second day of purchase.; Laptop physically very good no doubt. Performance every thing is good but the main draw back is battery life is only 1hrs. If you have to use this laptop you have use with charging this is not travel friendly laptop"

1) Performance is Top tier at this price. CPU will be a bottleneck in some cases as its a 13420H but will be fine for most used case scenarios.
2) Battery is OK
3) A little bit of false advertising saying it contains wifi 6E as shown in the attached photo but I checked and it has Wifi 6 Ax203. Most people won't notice the difference though.
4) Display is just ok. Can't complain at this price as all other laptops in this price segment give similar displays. Colors are really unnatural but in Display settings->Advanced Display-> Turn on ""Automatically manage colors for apps"". It will be fine after that.
5) Fans are loud yes but you can actually set custom speeds for fans easily, so I see no issue here. They are generally quiet when not gaming
6) Tried Cyberpunk 2077 at ultra and I must say it was a delight
7) No heating problems
8) Looks are nice, I wanted something which looks simple and basic but packs a punch under its hood, perfect for me
9) Lighter in weight than my previous laptop, no issues for me.
In the end- If performance is your priority, while also looking decent for office or college, it can be a really good choice. I heard i7 variant will launch soon and if that comes under 90k, it will be quite insane.
P.S- One thing I don't like is 512gb ssd only, If they had a option of 1tb at a little premium, it would be perfect. Well, atleast it's Gen 4.; Amazon customer accepted that they have given defective Product and always giving false hope of return and missing their own deadline.
Pathetic customer service. Not even top management acting on this.; ; Pro's :
1. It's value for money ( I am a btech student ) .
2. It's more portable and attractive than I had thought.
3. It's design in very classy ( not gaming one )
4. It is sturdy but not sure about its lifespan .
5. Beautiful keyboard with white backlight numpad and bigger trackpad.
6. No overheating.

Cons :
1. Battery life is awful üòû, sometimes it shows 1.8 hors battery left in 85% battery.
2. Sound quality is good but dts is just on but not making any difference at all, even Equalizer is not working , it looks like a gimmick.

Overall display is average and manageable , it does not let it down ,

But , if you want better build with 90 whrs battery life , Dolby audio , mux switch, etc and especially gaming looks , go for Asus tuf 15 i5 12500h rtx 3050

And if you want a professional looking laptop with better internal specs and don't do gaming that much like me ( use for btech ) , you should go for it.; Awesome product, good performance and worth buying it.good build quality,
Good battery life and camera is also better,
Value for money.; This is a great budget laptop. I managed to get it for just under 71k during the Diwali sale. In my opinion, this device offers the best specs for its price range in the current market. There aren't many laptops in this price range that offer an RTX 4050. So, without any hesitation, I would recommend going for it. The performance is excellent; you can run every AAA title on very high to maximum settings. Even some unoptimized games will run smoothly. The display is decent, and the battery backup is satisfactory, although gaming is recommended while plugged in for maximum performance. One minor issue I found was the placement of the heat sink, right above the keyboard, which heats up a lot after a gaming session of 2-3 hours. But I believe it's manageable; after all, which gaming laptop doesn't heat up? Overall, apart from 1-2 compromises, this laptop is a beast at this price point.; Purchased it for Graphics intensive work like CAD and Designing. Works well."

The laptop is Mast...; Has been using it for a week now. Very good performance and battery backup.
Very light weight and very less noise as well.
One issue which occurred on first day, it was not able to auto correct start-up failure but doing factory-reset helped in that. Now it is running very smooth.

CPU is low-power series within i5 (1240p). As a result, it doesn't perform as snappily as 12400h, which consumes far more power, and will deplete your battery faster. But overall, it's acceptable, it won't blow you away.
The GPU is the only ampere class gpu in the 2000 series, and performs decently. Almost mid-range performance.
RAM is DDR4. If you really have the budget, go for a model with DDR5 and higher clock (4800 MHz) RAM. These days, the bottleneck in performance is at the RAM level.
But for Rs 46k (after offers) in Diwali 2023, this one was the cheapest laptop with a discrete GPU and a 12th or 13th Gen processor.; Acer Aspire 5 cons: 1) Not that fast
2) Very low speaker sound
3) Games run on 35-40 fps max thats all you get
4) Nvidia Graphic card is only 15watts
5) No usb type c slot
6) No DVD writer ( you dont need it in 2023)
7) Cannot add normal SSD or HDD
8) Very high power consumption
9) 4GB graphics memory insufficient to run even 2012 games (EG: GTA5 needs 6gb atleast for good qualilty., rest of the games post 2023 need atleast 12 GB graphics memory)
10) Insufficient cooling vents. Only one vent on the right top of the laptop below the screen.
11) Gets very hot not suitable to place on lap or it will burn your skin.

Pros: 1) Decent Screen quality and size
2) 3 usb slots( 2 on left and one on right) + Thunderbolt slot +lan cable slot + HDMI slot + 3.5mm headphone jack included
3) Decent for video and audio editing
4) Not made for hardcore gamers or graphic editing
5) Battery is 1.3 hours backup
6) HD webcam included
7) Mouse trackpad is good and it has fingerprint reader on the left of trackpad
8) Wifi 6E (Removable adapter inside the laptop)
9) 256GB NVME SSD included. ( one additional slot for NVME ssd)
10) 12th gen intel i5 cpu very good. 12 core cpu.
11) 4 GB graphics memory NVIDIA with cuda cores.
12) 16 Gb ram included very fast
13) Backlight keyboard only white light
14) Drivers readily available online on intel and Acer websites
15) Supports bluetooth mics headphones all for online meetings even usb heaphones supported. But bluetooth mic should be of good quality.
16) Runs hot during gaming.
17) Medium weight laptop and a bit thick.
18) Aluminium frame. Does leak a bit of current on the top of laptop when you touch it. It can be solved with proper earthing wire.
19) Suggested to buy another keyboard and mouse so that you dont damage its keyboard inbuilt.
20) Supports windows 11 home. Windows 11 pro can be bought on microsoft store if you want encryption of drives.(Bitlocker)
21) 1080p resolution lcd screen.

I think there are better laptops out there in this price range. I only bought this laptop for wifi 6E and backlight keyboard. Better get a touch screen LED type for battery savings and dont pay for windows 11 pro. If possible get a DOS laptop and purchase windows 10 home.

For gaming i wont recommend, it only has 4gb ddr4 graphics memory which is too low in todays standards.

The bios does not have fan speed or voltage control options.

Booting speed is good. Boots under 5 seconds.; So first of all I wanna say I'm writing this review after a use of almost a month and this will be a long but so beneficial for everyone.

So far I'm happy with the product as I realised that this is not a top level gaming like Asus tuf but actually its far better than Asus Tuf Gaming or other gaming laptops in this price range because this purpose is actually for people who don't do much of gaming and do other tasks, though even if you do so play whatever you want it will give you 60 fps in forza horizon 5 at 720p so the heaviest game is going smooth and so on for hours probably we can say its actually for gaming purpose with a look of non gaming laptops so some may find it fascinating and some may not because if you're a student so more likely people will surely mock you if they see using gaming laptop even if you don't do any gaming and study only but we know relatives,, let's get back to topic so as per now its clear that performance is top notch and now it comes on video playback like what is the highest quality you can watch videos on YouTube so first of all to do that I would like to inform that you must first do some setups like turning on GPU and then doing other settings like always optimize for quality and performance and you also have to do it for Forza Horizon 5 if you wants 60fps in 720p otherwise if its turned off then you'll get upset so must turn on GPU as its off by default so turn it on then enjoy so after turning on you are actually able to play 8K videos on YouTube without any lag so that's such an amazing thing because people sometimes are confused regarding will it give you 4K quality or not and here it's giving you 8K quality on YouTube but it is a thing to be noted like most of the content of YouTube is actually 1080p content especially all series and movies so obviously this 8K video streaming is good but not a reason for one should buy this so what's the reason?? Absolutely the performance which is outstanding though that doesn't mean we should ignore this 8K superiority as this shows the capability of this amazing tech and the graphic card RTX2050 have good fans so that's also good for keeping it little cool so not much heating problem and build quality is amazing and due to being aluminium while plugged in you may feel some slight shocks which is like a vibration so don't be worried at all its just ok as its back cover is of aluminium so don't Worry of it as no big shocks it just feels like a vibration so don't worry next thing is the battery backup after you turn it on to the performance mode then battery last upto almost 3 hours on slight usage if you do gaming you can see how fast it drains so don't do gaming while its not plugged in so overall this is all good and it may look suspicious as why there ain't any cons in this laptop so don't worry here are CONS:

First of all and always note that this laptop is not for gaming if you do gaming then absolutely its not for you not at all

It doesn't come with MS office so those who use ms office a lot so please stay away from this because you'll have to pay extra money for MS office but the question does it worth it to purchase ms office? So the answer is depends upon how you wanna use like slight gaming, multimedia etc. Then ofcourse this is worth it and if not then no don't go for it

No free features üò≠ you gotta buy everything so man!! That can make it costly if you use Adobe, MS office, and any other paid subscription app because no matter what just pay!! So again does it worth to be pay so much after purchasing it so that depends on you because you know what you want so here in this case you have to check though it works best and overall performance is good but does it require all that thing well upto you!!

Perhaps for people who do other things especially study and believe this is actually for students because students do slight gaming and other things so for students nothing is better than this though profesinalist can also use because I can say its worth it as I've used because its very easy to use and everything so clean so just now upto you

I just hope this long review could help someone; Attention to anyone considering buying this laptop! Let me recount my experience: I purchased an Acer laptop and used it for about a month without any issues. However, it started overheating and the battery was draining rapidly. On November 18, 2023, the laptop abruptly shut down. I contacted the service center immediately, and on November 21, an engineer came to inspect the laptop. They identified a damaged motherboard and said it needed replacement, estimating a 2 to 3-day wait. After returning on November 28 with a new motherboard, they attempted to install it, but the laptop failed to start. The engineer suspected another issue with the replacement motherboard, necessitating another service request and an additional 3 to 4-day wait. As of December 5, the laptop remains unrepaired. This experience has been frustrating, considering the purpose for which I bought the laptop. I'm sharing this to shed light on the situation for everyone's awareness.""

Review after 1 month of use:

Processor:
-Ryzen 7530U is a best processor clubbed with 16GB RAM is very good for programming or running heavy applications.

Keyboard:
-I am not quite happy with the new keyboard in Gen 5 as compared to older gen. Lenovo says its more tactile but i feel it moved more towards chicket one which is not what a thinkpad user likes.

Webcam:
- Webcam could have been better. If there is a even a small light source opp. to the camera, images get very blur. In proper lighting it ok to use, but better to have a seperate webcam if your work requires frequent calls.

Battery:
- Battery backup is good for a window laptop. With Balanced setting it can easily last for 6-7 hours. Company claims 12 hrs which i feel is not possible and just a gimmick.

Display:
- Anti Glare screen is just amazing. you will love this if you are a developer and casual OTT consumer. However this is a IPS panel which i feel is the biggest upgrade from older gen thinkpads at this price range, but max brightness is slightly on the lower side of 250 nits. I may be feeling this slightly more i as i used Macbook Air M1 which has around 400 nits with retina display. Since this being built for professional use, i wouldn't recommend this for graphic designing or photoshop due to low colour accuracy in the display

Ports:
Having 2 USB Type C port in Gen 5 is a great plus. You get 2 high speed type a as well. Having Lan and HDMI port is a great relief compared to my Mac

Win 11 & Office:
Both comes pre installed and best part pre activated, you just need to link you office got and done.

Overall a great laptop for developers and normal OTT consumer. Value for money product with military grade design."

I asked for replacement, they said replacement wasn't available, it had to be returned. They did not pickup despite scheduling the pickup up twice. Also, every time the reason mentioned was pickup refused by customer which is totally false. If I was contacted I need proof of the same.

I need to travel tomorrow and it will be such a big issue for me now.My work is suffering so much. The customer care people are also not responding. It has been a horrendous experience.; The photo in display and the video shows the laptop to have a USB C port. The product that i received only has the USB 2 ports...NO USB C port (could be just an oversight or error by the seller). It's just a day since it arrived, no complaints as such yet. Looks like a laptop worth it's money.; Not so good product; The laptop has a heating issue, and the screen display is not satisfactory. It may be considered as an economical laptop from Dell from the heating is not expected from such a brand.; ; laptop Performance is Ok , especially availability of genuine windows and MS office Home edition along with bunch of other software preloaded. only you have to partition the SSD into local drives at your end to keep Program files in C drive . Otherwise it is Fast , better performance in 12th generation i3 processor from 11th generation i5.
Heating issue is there in all dell laptops including this one, so i will wait for next 2-3 months to check whether this heating issue creates any problem in performance of laptop in summers.
Dell shall arrange to direct blowers not towards the screen as in present case , in my opinion the the heat coming from blowers towards the screen may reduce or impact Screen due to heat blow. Laptop also heats from below , so i don't think it is advisable to keep it on lap ( legs) , better to operate on table or some platform.; Dislike:
USB Type C port is not there, however the product images and videos claim there is one Type C port.
Sad, Misleading claim.
Like:
Light Weight.; Worth ful for 35k
Lite use
Not heating issue , suberb built quality"

It's hands down the best powerful laptop & premium design looks with latest 13th gen i9 Intel EVO H-series processor + 16GB DDR5 + 1TB SSD + 2.8k OLED Display + 75whr battery!! & That too i got at 89k seems impossible tbh (prime day sale was pure blessing for me‚úåÔ∏èüòé).
I had to choose between Macbook Air M1 v/s Vivobook S15 & after brainstorming all pros n cons S15 is the clear cut winner under ‚Çπ1L price segment!!

Pros:
1. Powerful i9 (20threads)- so handle multitasks like peice of cake
2. 16gb DDR5 - r/w speed 4800Mhz - context switch is pretty smooth & fast!!
3. 1tb ssd- faster access & hell lot of storage (unless you've tons of movies, study materials;)
4. OLED Display is the USP of S15. I use it for almost 14hrs/day but cuz of eye protection mode, blue light shield & other stable parameters I don't feel any strain in my eyesüëÄ‚ú®
5. High battery capacity of 75Whr. It's Intel EVO so battery life is easily 8-10hrs I get. Supports fast charging. It takes max to max 2hrs for full charge (from 15 to 100%).
6. Light weight so feels quite handy.
7. Full keypad (backlit), huge trackpad + touch unlock(win hello feature), strong wifi 6E.
8. Awesome sound s/m by Harman/kardon(atleast better then prev versions) + Dolby Atmosüé∂
9. Pre-installed win 11 + Life time Ms office21 + (extra 2yrs warenty extension offer at ‚Çπ999).
10. No heating issue at all!! (Idk why People complaining about too much heating.. I use it for almost whole day with extensive cpu bound tasks but doesn't felt heat even for single time. While charging also it doesn't heatup much. I'm sure these people either would have playing graphics intensive games on this laptop or doesn't know how to handle a device efficiently). Also it is equipped with extreme cooling mechanism.
11. I didn't knew that latest Intel iris xe graphics handles visualization tools & ML projects efficiently.
12. Strong built (as it claims military grade testedüí™üèª)
13. Boot time is super quick ~ 2-3sec (ofc due to Intel EVO)
14. HD webCam with privacy Sutter.

Bonus:
-The box contain cute DIY laptop stand too, along with unnecessary swag stickersüòÖ
-Asus & Apple provides this thin cloth between keyboard & screen to cover

Cons:
-dedicated graphics (atleast rtx 3050) would have made this laptop the king among all.
-No RAM upgradibility
-req atleast 2/3 Usb3.0
-other minute issues can be ignorable (cuz love is blindüôà & also No device is 'sarv gun sampann')

Ps- if anyone can get it below 90k then it's a stellar deal. Cuz i9 H-series is never possible under 1Lakh & Intel EVO laptops are only for premium top-notch devices!!; After 2 weeks of purchase iam writing this review Battery backup is good, performance is also good no lags,but sometimes fingerprint sensor is not capturing.with 65w charger around one and half an hour it is full charged.spekaers also good but not loud.; This protect is an amazing anti creative production from Asus brand... I already started loving it has been more than the month it feels very smooth and premium to handle.... I definitely personally recommend this laptop with this configuration at this rate... Definitely by win win situation... One issue I face is that the sound is very very less has the speaker is at the back side of the laptop; ; Good Quality
Budjet friendly
High speed
Camera Quality is medium
Screen performance is good
Sound Quality is good
Key board is good; After using 4-5months, I like this Laptop very much due to its excellent display & superfast i-9 processor.

Go for it; In first amazon specification picture they promised a fingerprint scanner but when product arrived there is no fingerprint scanner and having lots of problem on powering on/off when i want to contact amazon they simply given dell support no but dell says that it is fault af amazon and seller plz give me a solution replace it and also having minor display problem; Normally laptop gets heat in heavy use but it is getting heat within 5-10 min when turned on, why... what problem? It happened and what's wrong in this product mechanism? I have time till yet and thinking otherwise the product is super and value for money, light weight, high storage....capacity...and very important the Reputed company name....; After 5 days of review
I bought this one from Amazon .
its good choice to buy.
Due to Intel core i5 processor you will get smooth performance and good battery performance u will get minimum 7 hrs for normal usage and all if u work heavily then u will get 5hrs atleast.... It will charge quickly...
Screen visibility and display quality is good because it provides anti-glare display. so, u didn't get any reflection while using.
Trackpad is also so smooth to operate.
Keyboard is good and it provides backlit while use on night times.
It will come with ms office and alexa inbuilt
Build quality is quite good .
Overall its worth to buy at this price range
Thank you Amazon and Dell; The machine is not getting unfolded- contacted DELL service centre- they informed that this defect is due to damage and will not be covered under warranty- where, it is completely a structural issue and the defect is not caused by any ‚Äòdamage‚Äô. Quite disappointingüòó; Please don‚Äôt buy this product‚Ä¶
The features they mention doesn‚Äôt exits in the laptop at all.

1. Fingerprint missing
2. Backlit keyboard is not there
3. Quality of plastic used is very bad
4. Heat related issues in the short usage of time

I don‚Äôt recommend at all to any one.; Product is good, as expected from Dell. But there is no backlit keyboard, neither fingerprint sensor, though Printed on box and also in product page. It's not expected from Dell and also from Amazon.; Laptop with processing power and speed. Excellent for home and office use."

Or you can just add another 8gb after buying it (or whenever you feel the need for it).; Got damage product pls reply; reviewing this after 6 months of usage, so far good; Battery backup ** only; Good laptop.

Beefy laptop with good performance.; Arrived today üòá excellent Product üí™üèªüí• but Wait ! come back after 4 weeks I'll shortly Update this review about pro and cons
Finally After some uses I'll update this review
Pro
1 Sound is loud enough to listen song or dialogue
2 Till now I haven't do coding or watching movies in this but only gaming and it's giving out very good performance 3050 doing its job playing GTA V on high graphics and giving 120 to 140 fps so don't worry about it
3 Display is good not the best cause it's ips and brightness is also good
4 built is very good and premium feels like business laptop and the logo is standing out
5 charging is very fast 200w charger y'll get with it
Cons
1 If you are in much wider area sound from speakers will not get into your ears that much but it's loud enough so don't worry
2 screen wobble is like too much just move a little bit it's wobbling not much people will get bother by this
3 Display is good but there is issue with the display if it is with my laptop only or all other also don't know but it's backlight bleeding if you google it y'll get it just in case screen bleeding means when ur screen goes full black green backlight you will see at every corner or 1, 2 corners of the display I'm trying to contacted hp care but it's not happening so i have to go physically to service center

Overall it's good laptop compared to price and specification
This is the normal review based on uses only if you want detail specification there are other reviews also; The HP Victus Gaming Laptop is a compelling choice for gamers on a budget who prioritize affordability and good performance for 1080p gaming. It offers a good balance of features and delivers a smooth gaming experience. However, if you prioritize factors like premium build quality, extensive upgradability, or silent operation.; I using for a month ,i didnt notice any problem
But may be you can disappoint at battery back up; I recently purchased the HP Victus Gaming Laptop from Amazon, and I must say I am thoroughly disappointed with my purchase. I had high hopes for this gaming laptop, but it has fallen far short of my expectations.

First and foremost, the battery life is abysmal. I expected a laptop with decent battery performance, but I can barely get it to last for more than 2 hours of simple usage. It's incredibly frustrating to have to constantly be tethered to a power source when I had hoped to use it on the go. This severely limits its portability and functionality.

Moreover, the laptop's performance is far from what I anticipated. With its 12th Gen Intel Core i5-12450H and NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU, I expected smooth gaming and multitasking capabilities. However, I've experienced significant lag and performance issues that make it nearly impossible to enjoy gaming or perform tasks efficiently. It's disheartening to invest in a so-called gaming laptop and have it struggle with even the most basic of tasks.

Adding to my disappointment, I've tried reaching out to Amazon's customer service team for assistance with these problems, but they have yet to arrive at my home after two weeks of waiting. The lack of timely customer support is incredibly frustrating and adds to the overall negative experience.

In conclusion, the HP Victus Gaming Laptop has been a letdown in every aspect. The short battery life, poor performance, and lack of effective customer support have made this purchase a regrettable one. I would not recommend this product to anyone, and I'm left feeling unsatisfied and frustrated with my Amazon shopping experience.; Build quality is fine , overall very good experience; Apart from build quality which does not seems to me great but in terms of every other thing...this product is best in class for every task. And most valuable for the range of 60k to 65k.

The Features it provides me at 61k,

‚Ä¢ Basic display with 144hz
‚Ä¢ Good CPU : Intel i5 12450H gaming Processor
‚Ä¢ Decent GPU: Nvidia Rtx 3050 with 75watts of TGP
‚Ä¢ 16GB DDR4 RAM/ 512 GB SSD
‚Ä¢ GOOD THERMALS
‚Ä¢ Professional design and slim build (plastic)
‚Ä¢ MS office life time for students
‚Ä¢ Good battry backup

‚Ä¢ Including all this feature in laptop The laptop has a great hardware features and professional looks but slightly decent build quality offered by VICTUS at a price for 60k at which other brands do little bit cost cutting at dispatch by giving 60hz penal and some brand provides low TGP. but this product belence every thing and still at the best price.

‚Ä¢ But nowdays If you can go Litt further than must buy acer Nitro V cuz it offers very great in segment features like no other brands gives to their leptops.
It's best product under 75k in any prespactive.

‚Ä¢ If you have slightly low budget than by aspire 7 with same spacifications but slightly lower TGP and some other ignorable drawbacks which doesn't worth mentioning.

But You have 60 to 65k than it's a great product to buy in fact 1st ranked. üòäüëçüèª‚ú®; This is my Third laptop
Laptop looks very elegant, the blue colour makes head turning

1, great customer support through lenovo vantage app.
2, no noice or heating issue
3, extremely fast: almost instant start, super fast app starts.
4, excellent battery life for full day coding use
5, display is optimal with IPS 60Hz WQXGA(2560*1600) {note: I use max resolution @ the scale of 200% for better readability)
6, smart wake-up with infrared face id
7, easy to work with and handle the laptop

Con: came with 10 months warrenty only. I used their pre-installed customer support app to raise a complaint. They asked for purchase invoice. I like their device transparency and feedback system for better customer support.

Update: they have upgraded my warrenty to 12 months from purchase date.; 1. Display is awesome
2. Keyboard is good. Not great but good
3. Face ID is good.
4. Note it runs hot initially while setting up. Later once set up is done the I noticed battery was hot and even you can feel chasy being bit hot at the top area of keyboard. I do need to check again but I used laptop stand for good air flow and surprisingly the temps dropped from 100 to 60 with in few minutes.
Only con is it's support s 2k extended monitor resolution but the graphics are basic I guess.
Support only 1080 p.; Nice highly recommend; Well the title really
It has stopped working after a month.
Won't even turn on.; I got this laptop as my Diwali gift. Everything is perfect but screen/ display is not at all worthy.; Laptop is good.; Bought this laptop in offline store with 16 inch display, i7 13700H and 1 TB SSD with a great deal.
Super Fast Thin & Light laptop with all metal body. Has Gaming processor H series.
Good display. Would highly recommend this laptop.; Bought on 30 September 2023 and using it from then:
1. It cots me 85k INR, in this price point configuration wise its a good available deal.
2. Battery is ok, on a full charge it lasts around little less than 4hrs.
3. I ran few tools like Eclipse, SQL Dev, 20 chrome browser instances and it is performing Ok. Hope it keep doing the same.

-Good backlit keyboard.
-All ports, full keyboard and big screen.
-Fast and does not lag.
-Display is crisp and clean.
-Speakers have good quality.
Cons:-
-Heates up alot.
-Big battery brick, only a problem if you are carrying it a lot.
-The hinges are a bit dull quality.
-Heavy to carry.

Overall the laptop is a beast for gaming, worth the price. But if you are traveling and want to take this out, then it's not recommended.

The delivery also got delayed by two days after ordering this during a sale.; Good laptop.; Only issue that I have is the 300W power brick which itself is so big and heavy you feel tired very easily and it gets a bit inconvenient to bring anywhere, rest I loved the product.; Got it for exchange in 92k.
Pros: It has advanced optimus
Cons: Ram is slow with type 1Rx16. It should be 2Rx8 type.; brought this for 87k after exchange discounts & EMI. it's looking good, and the sure system is powerful. but it hangs frequently. it should be smooth functioning but I hope with more updates the problem will sort itself out....; Product shipped without a warranty P-Slip i mean who does that, and the product's warranty has expired out of the box. Struggling to find a way since the device got delivered.
Shipped with a FHD Display where in the product description it's mentioned as WQHD and on the retail box as well.
No proper support from custom service nor from lenovo.
Being a Prime Customer feels useless at this point!!!!!; If you are a student or an office worker,,i don't recommend this that much, since it is bit heavier and mostly the battery Life,,i actually only got 2 to 3hr battery but got relieved a bit when using some tricks from a product reviewer in amazon , selecting thermal mode to quiet and gpu to hybrid igpu only mode,,then i got 3 to 4 half hours of battery,, eventhough it is the best in the segment for an overall purpose , students and office workers can look for other ones ,,but if you like this ,,defenetly go for it.. remember if you get something,you have to lose something,and nothing is fully perfect,,and don't stand back if you get a defective product or something, like it can happen anywhere,, check it well , analyse and take it as your daily driver.."

It's hands down the best powerful laptop & premium design looks with latest 13th gen i9 Intel EVO H-series processor + 16GB DDR5 + 1TB SSD + 2.8k OLED Display + 75whr battery!! & That too i got at 89k seems impossible tbh (prime day sale was pure blessing for me‚úåÔ∏èüòé).
I had to choose between Macbook Air M1 v/s Vivobook S15 & after brainstorming all pros n cons S15 is the clear cut winner under ‚Çπ1L price segment!!

Pros:
1. Powerful i9 (20threads)- so handle multitasks like peice of cake
2. 16gb DDR5 - r/w speed 4800Mhz - context switch is pretty smooth & fast!!
3. 1tb ssd- faster access & hell lot of storage (unless you've tons of movies, study materials;)
4. OLED Display is the USP of S15. I use it for almost 14hrs/day but cuz of eye protection mode, blue light shield & other stable parameters I don't feel any strain in my eyesüëÄ‚ú®
5. High battery capacity of 75Whr. It's Intel EVO so battery life is easily 8-10hrs I get. Supports fast charging. It takes max to max 2hrs for full charge (from 15 to 100%).
6. Light weight so feels quite handy.
7. Full keypad (backlit), huge trackpad + touch unlock(win hello feature), strong wifi 6E.
8. Awesome sound s/m by Harman/kardon(atleast better then prev versions) + Dolby Atmosüé∂
9. Pre-installed win 11 + Life time Ms office21 + (extra 2yrs warenty extension offer at ‚Çπ999).
10. No heating issue at all!! (Idk why People complaining about too much heating.. I use it for almost whole day with extensive cpu bound tasks but doesn't felt heat even for single time. While charging also it doesn't heatup much. I'm sure these people either would have playing graphics intensive games on this laptop or doesn't know how to handle a device efficiently). Also it is equipped with extreme cooling mechanism.
11. I didn't knew that latest Intel iris xe graphics handles visualization tools & ML projects efficiently.
12. Strong built (as it claims military grade testedüí™üèª)
13. Boot time is super quick ~ 2-3sec (ofc due to Intel EVO)
14. HD webCam with privacy Sutter.

Bonus:
-The box contain cute DIY laptop stand too, along with unnecessary swag stickersüòÖ
-Asus & Apple provides this thin cloth between keyboard & screen to cover

Cons:
-dedicated graphics (atleast rtx 3050) would have made this laptop the king among all.
-No RAM upgradibility
-req atleast 2/3 Usb3.0
-other minute issues can be ignorable (cuz love is blindüôà & also No device is 'sarv gun sampann')

Ps- if anyone can get it below 90k then it's a stellar deal. Cuz i9 H-series is never possible under 1Lakh & Intel EVO laptops are only for premium top-notch devices!!; After 2 weeks of purchase iam writing this review Battery backup is good, performance is also good no lags,but sometimes fingerprint sensor is not capturing.with 65w charger around one and half an hour it is full charged.spekaers also good but not loud.; This protect is an amazing anti creative production from Asus brand... I already started loving it has been more than the month it feels very smooth and premium to handle.... I definitely personally recommend this laptop with this configuration at this rate... Definitely by win win situation... One issue I face is that the sound is very very less has the speaker is at the back side of the laptop; ; Good Quality
Budjet friendly
High speed
Camera Quality is medium
Screen performance is good
Sound Quality is good
Key board is good; After using 4-5months, I like this Laptop very much due to its excellent display & superfast i-9 processor. Also, I do not facing any overheating related issue.; Good product ...smooth n faster ..battery charge fast n also drain fast...; Amazing performanance and in this configuration can't beleive just got it 75000 only thanks Amazon"

While there are other laptops available with RTX 4060 at cheaper price range, I believe this one with 13th gen i7 is a better value. The i7 will make sure cpu wouldn't bottleneck the 4060 and perform at it's best.

Also the thermal in this is great. Comes with minimal bloatware which can be easily uninstalled. Also the bettery is great for light usage. There is a lot of review about the battery backup being 1-2 hrs which is simply not correct.

I would definitely recommend this one for this budget.; The build quality is good. It looks great and the performance is solid. I never had any issues so far. Another thing to point out is that I live in really hot area and in my experience most gaming laptops hit temps above 90¬∞ under heavy load. But to my surprise the lenovo loq always remained at the low 80s and below.

Now for the negatives.
- Despite what I said earlier the keyboard on the laptop gets really hot under load.
- The speakers are noticeably lower in volume compared to most other laptops.
- battery life is quite poor so don't expect to be using this to watch movies while waiting for a flight. Battery lasts barely 2.5 hrs and that's when it's basically idle.

But if you're gonna use this for gaming I don't think battery life is gonna be an issue. You'll more than likely be plugging it in whenever you use. I'd say for this price range it's definitely worth it. But keep and eye out for other options as well.; Performance is very good. You can do any heavy task with ease. I got it for 74K after exchange and discount. For me it's value for money; Fastest Windows Computer I can say in this Budget...performing like a beast!; This laptop comes with great specs . I am telling you some important secret
1) It can goes upto 4.90 Ghz
2) It can goes upto 105tgp
3) you can upgrade Ram upto 64GB not 32 Gb
4) you upgrade upto 2*2TB = 4tb(already 512gb included if you wish then remove it and go for max upgrade)
5)Battery in my model 60watt it can last upto 3-4hrs at 40% screen brightness at igpu mode
6) It supports 2k gaming at 2k monitor
7) it has 10core(6p core and 4 E core) +16Threads which can handle easily heavy tasks.

For further info pls check @Tech digger channel.

Thank you; I bought this laptop last week during an online sale with heavy discounts on my Credit Card for just 85K!
Unbelievable value for money!

I opted for the i7 13th Gen CPU, to match the RTX 4060GPU, so that they complement each other.

PROS:
- Awesome looks and feel.
- Nice big keys on the backlit keyboard. (Backlight intensity is adjustable).
- IPS 144Hz 350 nits display gives a sharp image.
- USB 3.2 ports.
- Setting available to start the laptop automatically when the flip cover is opened.
- Comes with Windows 11 Home & MS Office (2021) Home & Student.
- MUX Switch available.
- 1080p webcam, with e-privacy shutter switch.
- Rugged MIL-STD 810H US military standard.
- Wi-fi 6 and BT 5.2
- Comes with NVMe M.2 512 Gb SSD (In the Module 2242 slot), with a vacant NVMe M.2 slot (Module 2280) for attaching another SSD for upgrading the storage.
- RAM expandable to 32Gb.
- Easy to overclock with just one click using the inbuilt Lenovo app.
- Silent internal fan. (About 15-20 Db)

CONS:
- Pipsqueak 2x2W speakers; have to use headphones to hear anything even in a quiet room.
- Hogs battery and needs to be kept plugged in most of the time. The 60Whr battery is insufficient for this beast.
- Free 1 year warranty had only 5 months balance left on it! (What the 'Fish'!) Am sorting it out now with Lenovo Customer Care. The Lenovo app keeps pestering the user with popups to purchase additional warranty.
- Heats up quickly despite the large air vents in its body. Need a good cooling pad to go with it.
- Lenovo should have given a Thunderbolt port with this PC."

But needs Improvement. The USB slots need to be increased. The screen size can be a bit more. The RAM should be increased for better performance. The battery life is somewhat low. Lasts only above 3 hours. This should atleast be 5 hours.; I got this laptop during the first covid lockdown. As Software engineer, I had to go for good specs and so far it is delivering on that front. Build quality is bit lower as compared to some of top brands like HP, Dell etc. But as far specifications in the price range, its value for money; I'm thoroughly disappointed with this Lenovo laptop. The build quality is incredibly poor, giving the laptop a cheap and flimsy feel. The front camera's low quality makes video calls a struggle, while the battery life is shockingly short, barely lasting a couple of hours even with minimal use. What's worse, the laptop heats up rapidly, making it uncomfortable to use.

When I reached out to Lenovo's technical support about the battery issue, their response was unsatisfactory, showing a lack of concern for the problem. A Brand technician suggested returning the item, but things took a bizarre and shocking turn when he told Amazon that he had already visited us and examined the laptop, which was then found to be in good working order. This level of deception has eroded my trust in the brand.

Overall, this laptop's poor build, subpar camera, dreadful battery life, and questionable customer service have left me regretting my purchase. I strongly advise against considering this model; it's been nothing but a series of frustrations and disappointment.; Good quality; My first 4 days of review:

I am a pro programmer (not a gamer) and laptop usage is heavy, so this meets my requirements.

i7 processor - Works wonders for me and fast processing (5/5)

Laptop build - Ok for this price. The top Lid is a concern as it is prone to scratches and fingerprints as kids have tendency to touch laptop again and again. Plastic body makes it more delicate. (4/5)

Keyboard - Works smooth and is good. Its just that I am using numpad keyboard after a decade so trying to learn how to use it. (5/5)

Screen display - Its is good and watching any youtube or netflix movie is a good experience. Slight glare problem is manageable. (4/5)

Battery Life - This is a bit of concern despite high battery life claims by Lenovo. Battery after full charge will discharge quickly so we have to be a bit careful on what you are doing on it. (3/5)

Charger - The charger tends to be a bit loose when connected to the main supply. Charger got overheated within few mins of charging so I kept on checking for it and had to switch off at times. Wire length is not good as it is only for desktop charging when laptop is just next to it. Might have to purchase a better one. (2/5)

Overall Review: 4/5 as it is still superior in performance compared to my previous laptops used. Lenovo could have improved on battery life and charger at this price.; 2 years warranty mentioned. but i received 1 year only. Kindly explain.; I don't like
Battery is lasts for 4-5 hours
Sound quality is poor
Camara is waste
Heating heavily after working for 30 min
Laptop quality is very bad,if you use you get experience the sound like hollow type or something
Cheap quality material used
Smoothness is good
Brightness is average
Laptop os good for students but no for heavy usage"

Beefy laptop with good performance.; Arrived today üòá excellent Product üí™üèªüí• but Wait ! come back after 4 weeks I'll shortly Update this review about pro and cons
Finally After some uses I'll update this review
Pro
1 Sound is loud enough to listen song or dialogue
2 Till now I haven't do coding or watching movies in this but only gaming and it's giving out very good performance 3050 doing its job playing GTA V on high graphics and giving 120 to 140 fps so don't worry about it
3 Display is good not the best cause it's ips and brightness is also good
4 built is very good and premium feels like business laptop and the logo is standing out
5 charging is very fast 200w charger y'll get with it
Cons
1 If you are in much wider area sound from speakers will not get into your ears that much but it's loud enough so don't worry
2 screen wobble is like too much just move a little bit it's wobbling not much people will get bother by this
3 Display is good but there is issue with the display if it is with my laptop only or all other also don't know but it's backlight bleeding if you google it y'll get it just in case screen bleeding means when ur screen goes full black green backlight you will see at every corner or 1, 2 corners of the display I'm trying to contacted hp care but it's not happening so i have to go physically to service center

Overall it's good laptop compared to price and specification
This is the normal review based on uses only if you want detail specification there are other reviews also; The HP Victus Gaming Laptop is a compelling choice for gamers on a budget who prioritize affordability and good performance for 1080p gaming. It offers a good balance of features and delivers a smooth gaming experience. However, if you prioritize factors like premium build quality, extensive upgradability, or silent operation.; I using for a month ,i didnt notice any problem
But may be you can disappoint at battery back up; I recently purchased the HP Victus Gaming Laptop from Amazon, and I must say I am thoroughly disappointed with my purchase. I had high hopes for this gaming laptop, but it has fallen far short of my expectations.

First and foremost, the battery life is abysmal. I expected a laptop with decent battery performance, but I can barely get it to last for more than 2 hours of simple usage. It's incredibly frustrating to have to constantly be tethered to a power source when I had hoped to use it on the go. This severely limits its portability and functionality.

Moreover, the laptop's performance is far from what I anticipated. With its 12th Gen Intel Core i5-12450H and NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU, I expected smooth gaming and multitasking capabilities. However, I've experienced significant lag and performance issues that make it nearly impossible to enjoy gaming or perform tasks efficiently. It's disheartening to invest in a so-called gaming laptop and have it struggle with even the most basic of tasks.

Adding to my disappointment, I've tried reaching out to Amazon's customer service team for assistance with these problems, but they have yet to arrive at my home after two weeks of waiting. The lack of timely customer support is incredibly frustrating and adds to the overall negative experience.

In conclusion, the HP Victus Gaming Laptop has been a letdown in every aspect. The short battery life, poor performance, and lack of effective customer support have made this purchase a regrettable one. I would not recommend this product to anyone, and I'm left feeling unsatisfied and frustrated with my Amazon shopping experience.; Build quality is fine , overall very good experience; Apart from build quality which does not seems to me great but in terms of every other thing...this product is best in class for every task. And most valuable for the range of 60k to 65k.

The Features it provides me at 61k,

‚Ä¢ Basic display with 144hz
‚Ä¢ Good CPU : Intel i5 12450H gaming Processor
‚Ä¢ Decent GPU: Nvidia Rtx 3050 with 75watts of TGP
‚Ä¢ 16GB DDR4 RAM/ 512 GB SSD
‚Ä¢ GOOD THERMALS
‚Ä¢ Professional design and slim build (plastic)
‚Ä¢ MS office life time for students
‚Ä¢ Good battry backup

‚Ä¢ Including all this feature in laptop The laptop has a great hardware features and professional looks but slightly decent build quality offered by VICTUS at a price for 60k at which other brands do little bit cost cutting at dispatch by giving 60hz penal and some brand provides low TGP. but this product belence every thing and still at the best price.

‚Ä¢ But nowdays If you can go Litt further than must buy acer Nitro V cuz it offers very great in segment features like no other brands gives to their leptops.
It's best product under 75k in any prespactive.

‚Ä¢ If you have slightly low budget than by aspire 7 with same spacifications but slightly lower TGP and some other ignorable drawbacks which doesn't worth mentioning.

But You have 60 to 65k than it's a great product to buy in fact 1st ranked. üòäüëçüèª‚ú®; This is my Third laptop

Totally dissatisfied with the product & service üòû; Other than display most of the things are good. But display! I don't know why is this kind of display even sold. Its like this iridescent material. Meaning it shows different colours in different angles. Its so bad that if you keep your head still and see it with your left eye you will see a different colour compared to what you see with your right eye. Top of the screen is one colour and brightness. Bottom of the screen is another colour and brightness. And it changes with the angle you are viewing. It gives headache to look at the screen. Its horrible. Regretting buying this very badly.

It is very fast and durable.; Hello, i have been using this laptop for 7 days now. It has some good features and some bad ones. This laptop firstly came with an intel core i3 12th gen processor which has a quite good reputation. This computer is very butter smooth multitasking laptop. It has 8GB of Ram which makes the laptop capable to run multiple apps and chrome tab without any hassle, it doesn't take much time to open chrome. This computer aslo has a NVMe 512GB SSD, i love how they added this SSD to make the laptop faster, the boot time of this laptop is less than 9 seconds (depending on how may applications are installed). It is a very fast SSD in your budget (i think). The battery backup is kinda good, it keeps your laptop on the go for almost 10 hours without its charger (depending on what you are doing on the laptop). This laptop is equipped with Intel UHD 780 graphics with 4GB VRAM which makes the laptop capable of mid video editing and photo editing without hassle. Asking about gaming, I played Tom Clancy's The Divisions, GTA V on this, i got almost smooth 60fps on 720p lowest settings. Since i told the good side of it. Here are some drawbacks of this laptop. This laptop have poor sound quality like the volume is too low for me i think. That's all...; Yes autocad running smoothly on this laptop you can also play heavy games like gta v, far cry series on this as a casual gaming purpose. Ram is upgradable upto 32 GB it's really awesome. Thank you acer for made a good laptop in this price range. No heating issue till now . Display quality is also nice at this price range. Smoothness when I'm talking about it it's running so smooth . Overall a good laptop for students, office user & also casual gamers. Review after one month of use.; The power button of the laptop is problematic. The laptop doesn't get on when we press the power button. One need to put the laptop on charge to turn it on. I first thought that the laptop is not charged hence it is happening but this happens again and again as when the laptop turns on it shows more that 50% charged but it doesn't get turned on without putting on charge.; Laptop is overall good for students*.

Quality of the product is also really great, it will be slightly on the heavier side but its a gaming laptop so no issues. Appearance is classy and RGB lighting is rare in this price.
Display is just like any other display in this price range. It can play 4k videos on YouTube so no issues.
Only downside of this laptop at this moment for me is its battery, with i gpu only mode and performance mode turned on, backlight turned off and brightness set to 50 percentage the battery will last for 3 to 5 hours according to you, but remember this is a windows gaming laptop with 85 w tgp rtx 3050 so the battery backup is not bad.Also you will only use a gaming laptop by plugging in. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GAMING LAPTOP THEN GO FOR IT, IF YOU WANT A LAPTOP WITH HIGH BATTERY LIFE THEN LOOK SOMETHING ELSE, ALTHOUGH I PREFER THIS LAPTOP. NO OTHER ISSUES WITHIN 3 DAYS OF PURCHASE, IF SOMETHING HAPPENS I WILL EDIT MY REVIEW; Seriously, do not even think about buying this laptop. It's just not worth it. Worst laptop. Slow, Over heat, Low screen brightness and many problems. Save yourself the trouble and find something better. I bought at 50k 16gb laptop with card during sale days. i wonder why this much low priice offering now after delivered i get to know its worst laptop.; ; Best gaming laptop compared to upto 80k laptops.
I bought it for 62990.
But in summer sale it is for as low as 55400.
Pros: Antiglare Display and Performance this combination of CPU and GPU can only be seen in 80-90k laptops.
Note: battery lasts for around 2-3 hours in Normal use and 1 hour while gaming. See it's already insisted to use laptop plugged in while gaming, so don't mind battery, since it has 4 cooling fans and they require power.; I bought this laptop for 57k after Bank Discount and this Laptop Is Amazing. Its display is also nice and giving a good quality Go for It i you are looking for a laptop in this range its value for money sound Quality is good but i would prefer using headphones while gaming on it and the batter is also good i have been playing gta v for straight 4 hours on it and it didn't even lag a bit Its Amazing laptop; bought it at 57k , honestly its a goddam steal; ; "

Here are a few things I enjoy and don't like.

The Thinkbook was the last model I saw while I was shopping for a laptop to buy, and I kind of loved all the specs in this price range. When compared to every other brand with the same specifications, this appeared to be a great deal.

I didn't know this till after I bought the laptop, but out of all the features I appreciate, the speaker is among the worst. For the past two years, I have been using my friend's HP laptop, which has the best speaker ever‚Äîit produces great sound even when it is only half loud. Please cross this laptop off the list if you're searching for one with nice speakers.

I've now noticed that the screen brightness is the next drawback. In all of the screens, I always use the lowest possible screen brightness. I would always use '0' on the same HP laptop because that is my ideal brightness level; however, with this laptop, I had to use at least two levels.

Other than the two drawbacks mentioned above, I haven't had any difficulties. Once I've used it for a while, I'll update the long-term review.

If any of you utilize this laptop, kindly share any positive and negative aspects with us.; This product for suppose to be a gift for my mom but turned to be a nightmare. Ever this product was delivered my mom has been trying to turn the new piece on but the display shows a blank a screen. Just a heads up the battery is fully charged. On speaking with amazon they said have a word with Lenovo on it.
Lenovo has been throwing tantrums that contact the supplier. It seems that nobody is ready to take the responsibility and busy playing blame games. Lenovo promised to send technician on calling Monday morning but I get a simple email from them that the serial number doesn‚Äôt match the invoice hence contact supplier. Though over the call they did say that the technician will come over and check the invoice soft copy. My parents are in their 60‚Äôs Amazon take up the responsibility and issue a replacement. As it‚Äôs not my parents mistake that the product turned out to be defective but they are facing the consequences for it.; I think that this is the cheapest laptop with a Ryzen 7730U Processor, 8 GB RAM and a Fingerprint Sensor. I purchased this for my father, who likes his gadgets to be as future-proof as possible. This laptop is priced at under 50K, and at that you get a sturdy workhorse of a machine.

Pros
- Very sturdy build. Laptop looks so pleasant and elegant.
- Keyboard is classic Lenovo. Very good typing experience, backlight is available in 3 modes: off, low and high.
- Up gradability: You can add another RAM, and the 512GB SSD can be swapped for a 1TB in the long run.
- Charges using USB port, but doesn't charge via phone/tablet chargers. I tried my 33W Xiaomi Adapter as well as my OnePlus 100W Adapter. Neither worked. But the laptop's charger charges my phone and tablet just fine. It's a good option as it charges in 4 Voltages: 5V, 9V, 15V and 20V.
- Fingerprint Sensor works like a charm.
- Webcam is more than acceptable.

Cons
- This laptop does NOT come with Windows 11 Preinstalled. You need to install it on your own.
- During Windows 11 installation, I felt the laptop heating a bit, the heat seeps through the keyboard, and you feel it near the WASD keys. I didn't experience this issue during regular use though.
- If you charge the Laptop while using it, even for casual tasks, it takes a bit longer to charge.

To sum it up, if you want the Lenvo reliability and a good processor, all under 50K, this one is where your search ends.; Best product for daily office use; Sound quality is worst üò©.
Overall performance is good.; ; Good laptop in budget but if u want see it's real performance upgrade ram to 16gb buy and u can play pubg g in 1080p in 60 to 81 fps but I don't suggest it I just check and I have to video editing also only screen is con other than that everything is super in this budget"

I've been tracking this laptop for over a year since it launched in May 2022, and I'm thrilled to finally have one in my hands.

This laptop is a beast. It has a powerful H-series processor, a long-lasting 70Whr battery (one of the largest batteries on the market), and a stunning OLED display. I'm especially impressed with the display. The colours are incredibly vibrant, and the blacks are truly black. It's a perfect display for watching movies and TV shows, or for editing photos and videos.

The performance of the laptop is also excellent. It can handle even the most demanding tasks without any problems. I've used it for gaming, video editing, and programming, and it's performed flawlessly.

I'm also very happy with the battery life. I can easily get 7-8 hours of use on a single charge, even with heavy use. This is a huge plus for me, as I travel frequently.

Overall, I'm extremely happy with my ASUS OLED S15 K3502ZA laptop. It's a great all-around laptop that's perfect for students, professionals, and gamers alike. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a powerful and versatile laptop.

**Pros:**

* Powerful H-series processor
* Long-lasting 70Whr battery
* Stunning OLED display
* Excellent performance
* Great value for the money

**Cons:**

* None that I can think of

**Overall rating: 5 out of 5 stars**

**Recommendation:** I highly recommend the ASUS OLED S15 K3502ZA laptop to anyone looking for a powerful and versatile laptop. It's a great value for the money, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.

**Additional tip:** I also recommend purchasing the 3-year warranty with accidental damage protection from the ASUS website. It's a great way to protect your investment.; Pros:
- Good plastic
- Good display - but no anti-glare
- Decent performance
- No sound keyboard - soft keys
- Camera just okay with manual shutter along with dedicated key privacy key
- Transfer speeds are good

Cons:
- Display flickers for some reason - haven't yet identified the reason.
- Battery at the maximum 2.5 hours even with 40% brightness.; Pros:
1. Value for Money
2. One of the most beautiful displays I have ever seen in the last 15-20 years.
3. Performance is excellent(you need to switch modes with shortcut key)
4. Decent Battery life
5. Lightweight and slim
6. Fast Fingerprint
7. 3GB/sec copy speed, 1-2GB/sec write speed with existing SSD
8. PCIE 4 Version (Youcan use SSDs that support 7GB/sec seq read)
9. Having 12 Cores (4P+8E) & 16 Threads, it's more than sufficient for software programming(not for ML/AI programming as it doesn't have a dedicated GPU), photo /video editing is very fast for any normal video(1080p) editing on Premier Pro or Lightroom for photo editing
10. Fast Charging (adapter size is also small)
11. 2 Thunderbolt 4 ports which support 40 Gbps

Cons:
1. As speakers are down-firing, you will feel that the volume is low(speaker outputs are good, it's just the direction which will impact).
2. RAM is DDR4, at this price range and considering the year 2022, DDR5 should have been supported. (12th gen CPUs support DDR5)
3. 16 GB ram is not sufficient as 6-8 GB will be consumed by IGPU
4. Only one RAM slot, so max you can go with 24GB only (Onboard 8 GB + 16 GB in the slot)
5. Webcam is ordinary, it could have been better; "

This is good 14inch laptop, lightweight, with Ms office pre-installed. On board memory limited to 8gb is an issue if you use memory hogging programs. Audio quality very bad. Very low volume a big disappointment. Otherswise quality of the product is good as expected for ASUS. Battery life is better than the previous laptop guess it is due to lp processor and lpdram. Display is good and camera performance satisfactory. Keyboard and touchpad good.keyborad could have been backlite ü•∫my score is 3.5 mainly due to low volume.; I have recently bought the Asus Vivobook 16 and I must say it's a very good budget laptop for daily basic usage and especially for a student like me. It's Intel i3 1215u processor handles basic tasks like PPT presentation Excel and net surfing very easily. It also has a decent display of 16 inches to watch movies and videos on.
It also offers a fingerprint scanner which is a very good thing in a budget laptop. One thing which I think is missing is the backlit keyboard at this price point otherwise the laptop is very nice and I would recommend you to buy it for daily usage and basic gaming ( Not heavy games like pubg gta v etc); i had ordered this product last week and received bad product which was not switching on , had to return the laptop , had to go through lot of issues and 100s of calls to and fro between ASUS and Amazon , struggled to return , now am re-ordering lets see what i receive and now the product price has increased from 39990 to 40990 , amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! , first i received a faulty product and then i see the same product price is increased ... how shameful ... please dont send a faulty product this time AMAZON , pleaes dont harass customers also while returning the product; Pros
1. OLED Screen: Awesome screen. True to life media consumption.
2. Processor: 12th gen U category i3 processor. Battery efficient and powerful processor.
3. Ram : 16gb upgradable. More than enough ram for work ,productivity and games as well.
4. 90hz screen so very smooth experience

Cons
1. Battery last for 4-5 hours on normal usage.
2. Plastic built so use carefully.
3. Camera is 720p so not good for a lot of meetings.; According to the budget you get really good laptop. Considering the price it is value for money.
Pros:
1) The display is top notch feeling viewing angles are really good that will never disappoint you
2) it has decent battery capacity considering the high resolution screen it is giving me around 4.5hrs approximately
3) Processor and user interface is really fluid combined with that 90hz .....it is very good for day to day usages
Cons :
1) If you want a laptop with atleast mediocre sound quality this is not for you because the sound it produces is very very low you can't even hear to any songs or movies
2) so if you are willing to sacrifice the sound just for high resolution screen just go head if not just choose any other brand
People who loves sound just don't buy this one you can't even hear single thing from it
(For Sound ..........it is just waste of money don't buy I repeat don't even consider this laptop go for better sound producing laptops ); Laptop is sleek with good performance.
Everything is good but there's been heating issue while charging and using it at the same time. Battery backup is average.; I bought this product in Jan 2024, overall it's decent laptop in this price (for me 42k). I'm moderate user, not use any heavy software. My previous device was quite old (2014), so for me this one is really fast. It boots quickly and apps load in no time e.g. Gimp, Chrome.
Battery life is around 5 hours with internet.
Camera quality can be improved.

Just by the new product with out exchange.; A nice,well balanced laptop..the latest launched Intel 1335U processor does the tasks properly...no issues at all..
I have not tried to play any games yet. Since the U series processor is not that game oriented..the battery backup is about 6 hours..speakers are great.
Good for students,working professionals..
I like the build quality..does not feel like cheap plastic.
But the quality of the webcam could have been better.

Cons: while starting the system led glow will be seen at some corners so I should check this
Though it is millitary standard laptop build is not that premium. You can feel some woggling and never gives you confidence to use it roughly.
To restart system from hibernate mode is a pain. We really dunno whether it is going to start or not.
Overall it us a decent laptop if any one can get it for 70k then worth the money else it is a bit overpriced; I see the OLED screen mentioned by Asus on box and product details but on Amazon details there is no mention about OLED screen.
But I like the build quality and 16 inch screen for multi media.; The laptop is very minimalistic, simple doesn't get too much attention. The screen is too good, almost every movies

Fingerprint scanner works very fast.
Overall practical design with all the necessary ports useful for me.; display color accuracy is good for photo editing, didn't try video editing yet... & Don't expect long battery life; At first I thought that the laptop is not working, later I got to know that its taking upto 20 - 25 seconds to Boot up.

Asus Service center said it as coil whine and they said it can't be resolved. 4 onsite service providers came and just gave this answer and wasted my time . They just extended 1 month warranty period as a compensation which is totally useless.
They not resolved and also not given the denied letter.
From Amazon by the warranty claim procedure Amazon can help me but they also denied to help me out .
I believed a lot in amazon but just They betrayed me
My simple advise is not to buy any high value product from Amazon just buy it in near shop.; It is an amazing laptop for this price range it offers a great performance, does miss the backlit keyboard also there is some cost cutting for the screen colour combination for the lower variants.

Being a new comer in the laptop market it has the same quality and specifications which some renowned company's laptop have
That too at lowest prices
Very much satisfied with the product
Very smooth and value for money
But one demerit is its battery life it's too low; Product not working and operating system very slow; This laptop is totally based for students who have their online lectures and for basic office work like excell website data entry,etc. You cannot except gaming performance on this laptop. Basic games would run but that too on a very low graphics settings and it will be a very sluggish experience. Build quality is good but not very nice, cause it makes sounds while opening hinges, even while it's been just 20 days. Trackpad can be a little better in terms of quality cauz the size is very big and comfortable. The keyboard does it's work but it's a rubber keyboard and not a chicklet keyboard. Also it does not support backlit keyboard. But still typing exp. Is very good at this price point. Camera is not good, it will not give proper colours and is very much zoomed. But again at this price point, it is not a big issue couz u can use ur smartphone cam with droidcam software. Also this laptop does not come with cooling fan. So it gets little heated some times if heavy tasks is being done. Battery life is decent at this price point, easily lasts for almost 6 to 7 hours for nonstop work. It is also very handy due to its 14 inch display size.
Besides you won't get common HDMI port, micro hdmi is there. And lan port is also missing. But you can find solutions for both on Amazon.

Conclusion: Buy it straight away if you only have to use it for yt & lect & basic office work.; i love this laptop thus laptop is not a book this laptop is a very trendy laptop and so much use full everyone, so please all of you i am suggest this chuwi laptop.; Google play store is not working
Sound is very low; The notebook is good for daily light work use; Never buy this Chuwi Herobook 14.1 product.

With in 10 days laptop shutdown unexpectedly.

Laptop when lugged-in showing battery is 100% when you start working it shuts down unexpectedly and after restarting battery shows low and problem continues.

Seller here at Amazon is useless and can't offer refund.

Support is rubbish, I went to Vadodara service center, they took my laptop and kept for 10 days and when returned - laptop OS was downgrade from Window 11 to 10 and battery problem continues.

I am still chasing for my full refund and I will get it anyhow and if required will go to consumer protection complaint formal legal route if support or seller don't provide refund.; Laptop sound quality is very low, cannot hear properly. It is a value buy; Necesitaba un pc para instalar Office 2016 pero no tengo mucho espacio en casa as√≠ que opt√© por un port√°til. Como digo, era para instalar versiones antiguas de Office 2016, nada de gaming o edici√≥n, as√≠ que no necesitaba ning√∫n pepino y quer√≠a gastarme lo justo.
Despu√©s de buscar en bastantes tiendas f√≠sicas, llegu√© a Amazon y vi esta marca, Chuwi, que no tiene malas valoraciones, la calidad-precio parece buena y ten√≠a un descuento de un 15%, as√≠ que lo compr√© y de momento genial.
En varios comentarios vi que no ten√≠a √ë, y no es cierto, lleva 3 teclados adaptables, uno con √±, otro jurar√≠a que es alem√°n, el otro creo que franc√©s y el otro no lo s√© realmente pero lo importante, lleva √ë.
El port√°til es color plateado, para el precio que tiene no parece demasiado plastiquete y tiene Usbs a ambos lados, salida hdmi, auricular y ranura para micro sd. Echo en falta una toma para Ethernet, pero es muy fino.
No entiendo mucho de procesador ni de caracter√≠sticas espec√≠ficas pero veo que va r√°pido, arranca r√°pido, las apps se abren bien, y la conectividad tanto por Wifi como por Bluetooth va genial.
Ya he instalado el Office 16, que era lo que interesaba, as√≠ como varias apps que no trae, ya que viene con Windows 10, como Chrome, y funciona todo con fluidez.
El uso que le voy a dar es dom√©stico, simple ofim√°tica casera pero a√∫n as√≠ he querido probar como va a la hora de ver pel√≠culas o series y aguanta bien pel√≠culas de 1080p, la pantalla se ve bien y el audio es bueno. La calidad de la pantalla est√° bien, la imagen en las series y pel√≠culas que he probado es buena.
La duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a est√° en torno a las 5-6 horas y la carga en unas 2 horas. Imagino que es lo normal, no estoy muy seguro, pero mi idea es utilizarlo conectado.
Imagino que con el tiempo se ir√° ralentizando al actualizar las apps y dem√°s, pero precisamente por eso no quer√≠a gastarme ni 1000 euros ni 500, porque los caros tambi√©n se quedan atrasados.
En definitiva, considero que para el uso que le estoy dando y que le voy a dar es una muy buena compra.; Ich habe einen einfachen Laptop f√ºr zu Hause und unterwegs gesucht. Ich nutze ihn √ºberwiegend zum surfen, E-Mail schreiben und einfache Office Anwendungen. Ab und zu ein Video oder Film sollte er auch ohne Probleme abspielen k√∂nnen.

Aufgrund des Preises habe ich mich f√ºr das Herobook von Chuwi entschieden.

Der Laptop kam gut verpackt an und ich konnte sofort starten. Die Installation ging kinderleicht (kenne mich mit Technik nicht besonders gut aus). Der Computer spricht mit einem und f√ºhrt so durch alle n√∂tigen Einstellungen.

Positiv:
Der Bildschirm macht f√ºr mich und meine Anspr√ºche einen guten Eindruck. Die Farben sind satt und hell. Es gibt auch keine dunklen Flecken o.√§.

Das Trackpad funktioniert bei mir auch reibungslos und leichtg√§ngig. Kann keine Verz√∂gerung feststellen, wie hier manche berichten.

Skeptisch gegen√ºber der Tastaturauflage war ich auch aber sie ist gut verarbeitet und liegt perfekt drauf. Es gibt kein verrutschen und schon nach kurzer Zeit bemerkt man sie gar nicht mehr.

Internetseiten und Programme √∂ffnet er schnell.

Der Laptop macht f√ºr den Preis auch optisch einen guten Eindruck. Er ist extrem leicht und leise. War mir besonders wichtig f√ºr Reisen.

Negativ:
Der Kartenslot ist nur f√ºr eine Micro SD Karte geeignet und diese l√§sst sich nur sehr schwer wieder rausholen. Aber mit einem Adapter alles kein Problem.

Es gibt kein vollwertiges Office Paket (√∂ffnet Dateien nur mit Internetverbindung im Webbrowser). Aber das kann man bei dem Preis sicherlich nicht erwarten.

Videos von einer GoPro konnte er nicht ohne zu stocken abspielen.

Fazit:
Man darf nat√ºrlich keine Erwartungen wie an einen Apple oder √Ñhnliches haben. Aber f√ºr den Preis bekommt man ein solides Produkt was die g√§ngigen Anwendungen abdeckt. Besonders das Gewicht und die schnelle Verarbeitung hat mich √ºberzeugt.; alles geweldig; Je voulais un PC portable pas trop cher, car je le d√©die qu'√† la lecture de mes fichiers audios.

Ero molto scettico nel prenderlo, in quanto non conoscevo la marca e avevo il pregiudizio che sotto il profilo tecnologico e costruttivo fosse un prodotto scadente, invece si e' rilevato un ottimo portatile per un uso quotidiano, per vedere film in streaming, per i video in 4k e 8 k , e infine per fare fotoritocco e montaggio video non a livello professionale.
In merito il materiale di cui e' fatto, confermo che e' completamente in plastica di buona qualita' e questo rende il portatile molto leggero da portarlo in giro senza sentirne il peso.
Come design riprende la linea dei portatili Apple in particolar modo dei Macbook pro e i Macbook air da 13 pollici, sottile e le finiture sono ben delineati, il colore argento rende il CHUWI HEROBOOK PRO un portatile elegante, peccato per la cornice del display che pur essendo abbastanza sottile per alcuni puo' far sembrare un portatile con un design un'po' datato confrontandolo con quelli sul mercato di oggi.
La tastiera ha il layout americana ma nella confezione ci sono gli adesivi di diverse lingue (italiano, tedesco, francese e spagnolo) per cui basta modificare la configurazione che non avrete piu' problemi.
La digitazione della tastiera e' buona e confortevole, non vi sono ritardi nella risposta durante la digitazione tranne per il tasto di accensione che a volte bisogna premerlo due volte per accendere il portatile. I tasti sono ben distanziati e non si bloccano durante l'uso.
Per quanto riguarda l'hardware nonostante il processore Celeron, l'ottima scelta di Chuwi di installare un ssd da 256GB M.2 non saldata sulla scheda madre e una ram da 8 GB, rende il portatile reattivo sia nell'avvio, sia durante la navigazione su internet e la visione dei film in streaming su NETFLIX. I video in 4k e 8k vengono riprodotti senza problemi, molto fluidi e senza bloccarsi .
La batteria ha un ottima autonomia, se si usa per vedere i film in streaming o i video in 4k o 8k ha un autonomia di 6 ore, invece se si usa per navigazione internet e con applicativi Office la batteria dura 8/9 ore.
Il portatile CHUWI HEROBOOK PRO e' un ottimo prodotto per la sua leggerezza nel portarlo in giro, per uso quotidiano, per navigare su internet , per vedere i film in streaming e i video 4k e 8k,per fotoritocco e montaggio video non a livello professionale, per gli applicativi office e per ultimo come pc di backup.
Il portatile CHUWI HEROBOKK PRO non e' adatto con programmi professionali per via del tipo di processore che e' installato, per cui se si pensa di acquistare questo portatile con il fine di usarlo a livello professionale vi consiglio di optare per altre soluzioni piu' performanti.
Consiglio questo portatile per coloro che hanno un budget limitato, se non si ha grande pretese nelle sue prestazioni, per uso quotidiano, per il lavoro, per la scuola e per uso domestico."

Ha ha ha ha; I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I am very happy with its performance. I am addicted to using it. The design (looks) especially with the lid closed is not sleek, it looks old fashioned. But that has no bearing on the performance or utility of the laptop which is stellar.

The laptop has got great build quality and amazing looks. The gaming performamce is also excellent. But only concern is with the colour accuracy of the display because in Amazon specification section it has been written that it has got 100% srgb but if we type the model no in Lenovo website it shows that this laptop has got only 45% ntsc. Amazon please resolve this issue.; The laptop is just awesome. Although would have preferred Win10 instead of 11, the system is fast and smooth.
I am a pro fortnite player and gaming was awesome on Fortnite, gta5 and wk22.

I must warn that the hot air blow from the 4 vents is too hot. I use it to warm my hands. Gpu runs at around 70 to 80 degrees during gameplay. I got the 3060 version.

Update : The games run smooth only when charger is plugged in, once it goes to battery mode (during power cuts) the FPS drops drastically and the GPU just cant handle the games without stuttering.
Although a laptop, it needs to be plugged in for gaming.

Also, I have a Zebronics UPS (600VA I think), the laptop charger is so bulky that the UPS goes off in 30secs when the laptop charger is on UPS. Good luck during power cuts.

Nonetheless, the laptop is a best buy.; Go for it. Its a beast laptop but I bought it for 1.39lacs but after 7-8 months the price dropped to 1.19lacs now it's 1.04lacs btw I bought this beast in 2022 end september. If you don't need it right now you can wait it'll save you around 35k within 1year and 4 months. In 1.39lacs I can now buy a legion 5pro with 3070 model and save around 10k too.; I don't see any performance issue as it's a beast but camera is worst quality and it stopped working after 2 months of purchase.; Good design & quality but slightly overpriced laptop.; Value for money,best gaming laptop it can run all games up to 60-120 fps ,and display is best unlike other gaming laptop."

If you are not a gamer, laptop is heavy, big and not easy to carry. It also do not have a fingerprint reader( Weirdly my first laptop without one apart from my first Toshiba from 2013).
Battery life is really bad
I also was not able to extend the warranty for the product from my acer app
Good
good screen, fast processor, customizable keyboard and fan.; Best at this price range for sure no lag while gaming sare game chala diye most of the big games like gta 5 , froza horizon 5, sab smoothly run krta hai ache graphics main ‚úÖ updates ke baad battery jaldi drain hoti hai but kuch din main it adapts wapas back to normal ho jata hai; This laptop is literally the best laptop u could buy if you're on a budget. I got this for 70k and the price to performance is the best. The processor competes with Intel core i5 12th and the DDR 5 RAM really helps in gaming. I would genuinely recommend this laptop if ur budget is 70 - 80k

Note : Always buy the 16 GB RAM variant bcz come on it 2024, u atleast need 16 GB RAM for best gaming performance.; The laptop crashes randomly, the battery drains very fast. Even with normal tasks the battery drains in 1.5 hours. Total waste of money; Excellent product, I brought AMD Version so battery exceed my expectations.. Display color could have been more better...
RTX 3050 gaming performance is really great

16GB DdR5 ram but even though laptop has 2 slots I got one 16GB STICK only..

Fans has slight noice, when it's run in full speed

Overall if you don't have problem with display color,you can go for it; Here is honest review you might be looking for
Like this laptop is must buy laptop under 62k
Good thermals
Beast performance
4-5 hours backup while doing smalls tasks
2-3 while gaming
Sturdy build quality
Good keyboard with RGB
DISPLAY Is just amazing
Only cons of the laptop is it's doesn't come with lifetime MS office; Best laptop in budget, i got RYZEN 7 7735HS 16 GB in 65740‚Çπ and in this budget, this laptop is out standing in specs it provides. Acer Nitro Sense is quite very amazing and manges heating issues properly, i have played many games like GTA 5, Froza Horizon, and Call Of Duty, this laptop never disappointed me...
At last if you get this machine under 70k go for it.. its really worth buying."

Never buy this product because you are going to regret later. Advice from my side brothers and sisters; **5 out of 5 stars - Beastly Performer for Gaming and Creation Alike!**

I recently purchased the ASUS Gaming Laptop with an Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM, and the NVIDIA RTX 4060, and it's been nothing but a delight. This machine crushes every game I throw at it with ultra settings while maintaining buttery smooth frame rates. The RTX 4060 GPU is a perfect sweet spot for gaming and content creation, delivering stellar performance without breaking the bank.

The 16GB of RAM is ample for multitasking, allowing me to keep multiple programs open without any lag. Editing videos has been a breeze, and this laptop chews through rendering tasks with surprising swiftness, thanks to the potent combination of the i7 processor and dedicated graphics.

The design is sleek, with a robust build quality that feels sturdy, yet it's not too heavy to carry around. The cooling system is top-notch, keeping the system cool even under heavy loads while maintaining noise levels that don't sound like a jet engine.

Now, it has come to my attention that some users have given this laptop less-than-favorable reviews, and I think it's important to address these. The most common points of contention seem to be as follows:

1. **Price**: Some believe the price is steep. However, considering the hardware packed into this machine, it is quite competitive. You really get what you pay for.

2. **Battery Life**: For a gaming laptop with this caliber of hardware, battery life is always a challenge. It seems some users expected more, but in my experience, the battery serves well for a gaming-focused device.

3. **Noise**: When pushed to its limits, the fans can get loud. Some users find this off-putting, but it's a small trade-off for keeping the system cool during intense gaming sessions.

In conclusion, the negative reviews often stem from expectations that may not align with the reality of high-performance gaming laptops. When purchasing this ASUS model, you're getting a premium device tailored for gaming and content creation‚Äîa fact that should set expectations for aspects like price, battery life, and fan noise. For those looking for a reliable, high-spec machine that delivers both in-game and during CPU/GPU-intensive tasks, this ASUS laptop is an excellent choice.

*Disclaimer: This review is based on personal usage and experience. Individual experiences may vary.*; All in all a nice packed laptop with value for money, I ran almost all latest games like Forza 5, CoD and others, it handles all of them at ease; This one is light and have high performance for a light weight laptop but when you consider it's gpu it will definetely dissapoint you as this one scoring a little worse than fully powered rtx 4050
If only asus used DDR5 ram and increased the max total tgp to 90w it would have performed much better
If anyone want a light weight laptop for battery then this is a no go as it has 12th gen intel which is not very power effiecient resulting in 4-5 hrs max battery only in normal usage.
Why would anybody sacrifice so much for just full metal build which is a boon and bane both at the same time
Asus in its premium vivobook pro oled used the same specs but that laptop has total tgp of 150w which makes that a killer light weight laptop but thats overpriced; "

Absolutely unsusable.

And I received the laptop today afternoon. I contacted amazon in evening. They want to install servify app which cannot detect the issue (Because its not designed to detect these kind of issues). And amazon Cant help.

Seems 1.3 lakhs gone.

Will review after using it for a few days.; Got it for 1.32 Lakhs on 8 Dec, 2023 with Ryzen 7 7840HS + RTX 4060 + 16 GB DDR 5 (5600 Mhz) + 1 TB Gen 4 SSD.

Pros :

1. Gaming performance is great. With google chrome browsing & youtube you can easily get 4 hrs+ battery back up. So, better energy efficient than i7 13700H & HX and of course less heating compared to Intel counter part. But slightly less powerful.

2. RTX 4060 is also an efficient one. It shows here on amazon140W TGP, but it will never reach there because it doesn't ever need that much power to operate. It can max out at around 115 Watt with easily outperforming 135 Watt 3060 Ti. So, here's also less heating. You can check international reviews about this thing.

3. Colour is 100% SRGB and in-built blue light filter helps you a lot.

Cons :

1. Boot time not upto the mark, a little bit slow compared Intel machines.
2. Has some bugs on sleep mode !
3. It has Nahimic 3 audio, but you know the software just sucks (with every machine though) !

Overall: 4 out of 5 Stars.; Tooo good; Best Decision to purchase This Laptop.; other brands have same specifications at around 1.1L but this at 1.5L is expensive but if you think about 3 year warranty + build quality then it may be good compared at others but it is definitely not worth extra 40k; Performance as expected. Boot time is not as fast as expected. Lower end IdeaPad gaming laptop had faster boot time. Both hybrid and auto hybrid GPU configurations are faulty, they boot into black screen after each shutdown and require a hard reboot to turn on properly. Only igpu and dgpu modes work. Therefore, Anyone who's usecase is always plugged in like me should reconsider their purchasing decision.

The charger is a 230w brick, so make sure you are using rated extension cords if you are using one along with other similar laptops.

I recommend that you buy a cooling pad either passive or active and a ports extender for creative professionals and ai/ml professionals. The default nvidea drivers installed are gaming versions, recommend to switch to studio drivers.

PSA: There is a McAfee bloatware bundled with this laptop. Please make sure you don't accidentally install it and promptly uninstall any that got through.

Thanks.; It's a good laptop, got what was written. Got a free mouse with it with a little crack but hey I ain't going through all the hassale just to return a free mouse with a slight crack. 3 month game pass be real nice.; All the people with the rgb missing please contact the lenovo people. As even I recieved it without it, but they got the issue solved by attaching the lose wire. In other case they also are providing a free replacement of the keyboard if under warranty period."

But this should not have happened this soon.

Anyways it's working fine now & after 6 months of use I am writing this review.
Great & fast service from Lenovo. Thanks!!; Product is good. But no backlit keyboard.; I have purchased this laptop before 3 months only but now my motherboard has been manufacture defect product. Laptop not on/off. I have complained this issue but support team they are replaced old motherboard. Now i have spend around 43k but they are sold old laptop. Worst service in Lenovo don't buy this laptop anyone and waste you money.; I bought this laptop and after 6 days my charge port not working correctly.Also one time ,Its automatically turnoff and after few hours turns on automatically. Now iam putting replacement; Pros:
Good Design
Light weight
Performance is okay

Cons:
Keyboard and trackpad is worst.
Display not good but okay; It doesn't have backlit keyboard but the device performance is efficient. Loads windows under 10 secs and no log observed so far. The sound quality is really good.; Every thing is good but you can control blacklit keyboard light. You can just turn it on or off. You can't change it to low, medium and high. And fingerprint senseor is not compatible for the hello window is showing.

Good points
Performance is good
Battery is good

Bad points
You can't ajust the light of keyboard. But you can it on/off

Fingerprint senor is not working error is showing."

I also played efootball 24 and it was also butter smooth.
Quality of the product is also really great, it will be slightly on the heavier side but its a gaming laptop so no issues. Appearance is classy and RGB lighting is rare in this price.
Display is just like any other display in this price range. It can play 4k videos on YouTube so no issues.
Only downside of this laptop at this moment for me is its battery, with i gpu only mode and performance mode turned on, backlight turned off and brightness set to 50 percentage the battery will last for 3 to 5 hours according to you, but remember this is a windows gaming laptop with 85 w tgp rtx 3050 so the battery backup is not bad.Also you will only use a gaming laptop by plugging in. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GAMING LAPTOP THEN GO FOR IT, IF YOU WANT A LAPTOP WITH HIGH BATTERY LIFE THEN LOOK SOMETHING ELSE, ALTHOUGH I PREFER THIS LAPTOP. NO OTHER ISSUES WITHIN 3 DAYS OF PURCHASE, IF SOMETHING HAPPENS I WILL EDIT MY REVIEW; Seriously, do not even think about buying this laptop. It's just not worth it. Worst laptop. Slow, Over heat, Low screen brightness and many problems. Save yourself the trouble and find something better. I bought at 50k 16gb laptop with card during sale days. i wonder why this much low priice offering now after delivered i get to know its worst laptop.; ; Best gaming laptop compared to upto 80k laptops.
I bought it for 62990.
But in summer sale it is for as low as 55400.
Pros: Antiglare Display and Performance this combination of CPU and GPU can only be seen in 80-90k laptops.
Note: battery lasts for around 2-3 hours in Normal use and 1 hour while gaming.

I am review lenovo thinkbook ryzen 3 7330U
Battery backup is amazing 4 to 5 hour
Fingerprint is working properly
Display quality 4.5
Sound quality is average 4.0
No heating issue
Overall Good.; This Think book is great for productive work! Excellent Lenovo customer support! Recommend adding an additional 8GB/DDR4 3200 RPM Ram. Presently, 2GB is shared with Radeon Graphics, therefore for better performance with video editing, coding, and basic gaming. Excellent battery -life/8 hours in my case! The fingerprint scanner is very responsive providing an instant boot-up! The Display is average, but, the antiglare coating is noteworthy!
Overall, very Happy!; It has been 4 days I am using this laptop . Everything is good in this laptop , it got lot of additional features at this price point like fingerprint sensor ,dolby audio, fast charging 65watt.
3 things that I don't like about this product is that the battery backup is not so good it only last 3-4 hours at minimal to medium usage although I haven't done any gaming or performance test on it so I cant, say about performance ,second is that the speaker sound is so low but sound quality is so good and the 3rd one is that the camera quality is like 2mega pixel its not good.
BTW it has ryzen 3 5300u which quite good processor as 5000 series is dope ,everybody knows.

If you guys are having a budget of 30000-35000 definitely check this product. Don't buy 512 gb variant it cost around 37000-38000 , you won't get anything additional in it except storage. If have that 40000 budget go for redmibook 15 pro i5 or honor magicbook 15 i5.

Screen is decent , brightness may bother you sometimes but its enough .
Build quality is decent it has metal body and its a military grade certified laptop.

I will suggest alternative laptops around 30000-35000 ,1) Honor magicbook x 15 but service is no available everywhere and it has windows 10
2) redmibook 15 i3 but build is plastic
3) acer extensa 15 but you get 4gb ram under 30000

I will update this review after 1 month usage and some gaming test also.; Previously i owned an Acer swift laptop (10th gen i5 with ssd) which cost me almost 60k. But it could not handle the indian summer heat and became dead before completing 3 years.
After that i understood the drawbacks of compact, thin laptops(also the 'fast startup' power iption).
So i bought this sturdy 15 incher. This is a proper heavy laptop. I hope it can withstand the indian summer.
Cons are no backlit keyboard.
And those who are confused about RAM management, its because if integrated AMD memory which is included in the RAM. Thus 6 gb RAM + 2 gb graphics.
I hope to increase my RAM and ssd memory after sometime; Display is really bad, may be it's good for the eyes I don't use it much.; This is the review from my 10-year-old son.

1) He is using it for educational and gaming purposes. He finds it is smooth to play roblox, minecraft, Fortnite, and fall guys.
2) Ryzen 3 is absolutely smooth and doesn't lag.
3) Connectivity is quick.
4) Antiglare display helps in better viewability.
5)Battery backup is awesome and there is no need for frequent charging.; This laptop has only one extra SDD slot, you can buy Sata3 SDD and use another OS like linux or other. But some video over net may confuse you that it has one spare M2 slot. Boot from SD card or USB does not work on this PC though this is with UEFI interface. Pressing F12 does not show up, bootable USB, if it is linux. Workaround for this is install UEFI grub option on your USB stick, then it will appear in F12. Other that that sound is good, and you can expand memory upto 40GB which is good. Battery is descent I use almost for 7-8 hours. Weight wise it is bit heavy. Screen is good but I am not fussy about screen. Overall good laptop at the price. Has fingerprint, and wifi6, processor is Radeon3 4x4.; Useful purchase"

I use it for my work and productivity related things and this laptop aces them in every aspect. The quite blue colour is very attractive and classy. The embossed logo at the back of Asus Vivobook does not look good on pictures, but in reality it looks sexy.
On performance grounds, it's very good, not the best but as per it's size, weight and other things, it's one of the best options. I know upgrading the RAM and storage is not possible, but for my usage 16gb RAM & 512GB storage is enough for the next 5 years, coz most of my data is in the cloud, nobody downloads movies these days, so i really don't need more storage. Although gamers might need more storage.
I don't game much but after I bought this laptop I bought FIFA 23 pc and it works fantastic in medium settings. At high settings also the gameplay is great but the other animations stutter sometimes. Also the game itself has a lot of bugs so can't really complain.
The display is not colour accurate, but to the untrained eye, you won't even know it. The display is decent bright and does it's job. 144hz is a great advantage. Sound of the laptop is okayish, little low end heavy. Although you need to tune it in the Dolby app as per your convenience. It's loud enough and does its job although not very good sounding speakers.
Most of my work is done in chrome and few apps like Android studio, VS code and other things. For that purpose this laptop does extremely well and i could not have asked for more, also the looks alone which is not gamery and so classy justifies it's price.
Anyone looking for an all rounder, like the jack of all trade, best of none, this is the one for you.
Also to note heating is also not a problem at all. I really have not tested it to it's extreme limit as I don't want to and have no intentions also but I guess it can do pretty well for a mid range laptop.
BTW you can change the graphics driver in the GeForce experience app from studio drivers to gaming drivers, if you want.; This laptop provides 3050 with a fast processor for 59k which is commendable.. The after sales is amazing.. Screen quality is also good and I chose this because of its weight but it turns out there were more features that makes me give this laptop a 5 star review in terms of value for money... I believe this would do all the tasks of a student who has extensive work ... Certainly not for someone whose primary task is Hardcore gaming for hours a day and studies are secondary.. Overall amazing. Sound quality is amazing with a lifetime subscription of Dolby Access...; The laptop works exceptionally good but the only problem is that the build quality is sacrificed for the laptop features. The battery life is very reasonable this laptop provides the perfect balance for work and play. Best for college students who want a little bit of gaming as well as productivity. The laptop looks sleek whilst being a gaming capable machine. The screen is really good. But the laptop is a fingerprint magnet. the cooling is good and can be controlled by the in built app Pro Art. overall its a value for money with a little corner cutting in the build quality. Ps : The screen wobbles a lot; I generally never write a product review unles it's either too good or too bad. Fortunately, this one is on the too good side of things. For the price (highest price is 65990, can get as low as 62990) it's an absolute banger. The performance is absolutely stunning. The battery life however is not that good for gaming. On the other hand, battery performs surprisingly well while handling very minimal tasks. It's a lot lighter than other laptops in the same performance class. Feels premium. Display is not glossy and is matte so thats really good. Brightness is better than average. Speakers are not as loud however with volume booster in the pre-installed proart creator hub you can make them as loud as you want.; screen quality is good
performance is good but little bit heat in heavy use
keyboard and touch pad is good
fingerprint scanner work well in windows not in ubuntu
speakers are loud and nice quality even turn on volume booster in my asus app
battery backup is little low
normal use get 3-4 hours otherwise very less; I Purchased this laptop 2 months ago.Waited to get to know about this laptop completely.
It's an amazing Laptop and worth for your money. Don't change your decision which others say, It's the Best laptop in this Price range. It's Complete with great display, great performance, excellent battery backup üíØ,All things are sooo good ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•.If you have this in your Budget Just go for it ,You wil never be disappointed üëç; First , the screen display resolution brightness quality of this laptop is really bad when you compare it with laptops of similar price, this laptop is not worth the price due to its poor display.So even if other features are fine it doesnit justify the price.

Now coming to amazon experience, they are not willing to accept the return fo the laptop saying there is no defect in laptop.

.Lesson is never get expensive products from amazon because if there is any quality issue it is not possible to return it, always go to store and buy the product, where you can actually see the product befor buying.

I hope this experience of mine will genuinely help other buyers from making the mistake I made.

Amazon has cleverly automated the customer service number which makes it difficult to contact customer service representatives , its like their customer service doesn‚Äôt exist. Most pathetic customer service experience, to say the least.; Well i recently purchased this model after a thorough study on the specs and also considering the kind of budget, I would highly recommend for users who are into creative work and designing work and also according to the kind of work you are into you may go for this model.

The key reasons for choosing this laptop are:

1. Good Brand - HP
2. Decent Processor (Intel Core i5), intel iRISx Graphics, and 16GB DDR 4
3. Easy to carry around - 14"", Light Weight
4. Backlit, Good Looks, Finger Sensor, ....

Since Purchase:

1. Easy to setup
2. Windows 11 Home, Office 2021 (life time validity)
3. Super fast
4. Excellent display with warm color setting to block off the blue light
5. Fast charging

Very happy with my purchase ...; Writing this review after one month of usage.

Pros :

- Performance is pretty good thanks to 12th gen intel i5.
- 16gb ram can handle multiple tasks together easily.
- iRIS Xe graphics is capable for regular graphics related tasks and games like GTA 5, fortnite runs smoothly with default graphics settings.
- Fast & Responsive Fingerprint Sensor.
- Build Quality is awesome and Hinge is better than other brand laptops.
- It can handle Android Studio, VS code, Emulators and virtual machines along with multiple chrome tabs.

Cons :

- Heating issue when playing games. and can't change FAN speed through any HP utility program.
- Battery Life could be improved. but you'll get enough battery life for regular tasks and browsing, media etc.
- No Smart Charging support even after updating BIOS.; it has been 10-15days and laptop is working fine. I am mostly using it for lightweight coding and reading purpose.
battery backup is actually ok , around 4-5 hrs with above workload.
sound is ok too not that great but I expected that already.

what i really liked is the classic keyboard layout no wierd surprises and with good backlight
fingerprint works fine.

Microsoft suite was provided on registration which popped up sometime after booting first time.; Laptop is very good, received bin good condition, meet my expectation, worth for money.; I have been using this product for more than one month now. Speed & low weight is a positive. However, the laptop switches off or hangs on its own even if slightly moved while working. It keeps on losing battery very quickly even if its shut (not shut down) and becomes hot while doing so. The performance is much below satisfactory; This is my first Laptop purchased on any Online portal.
Delivery was good and packaging was sturdy.
This is compact light weight and does everything.
Sound quality is excellent,
Screen is very good. Battery backup is 4-5 hours with moderate activity.
You don't need any service to setup this Laptop, if you can read simple English and willing to spare some time, it will be over within 30 minutes.
Even Warranty registration for Office is quick and easy.
Overall, no issues found.
Highly recommend this HP Laptop.; Battery backup is not up to the mark. Company offers 8 hours backup. But this new laptop gives hardly 2 to 3 hours only. Else everything working fine; An excellent product with good UI."

I use it for normal and have no problems . It works smoothly and has a good screen ( for me atleast) the size and weight is also of my liking. Though please note that the 8gb variant does not come with a pen. The touch screen in my opinion is fine I won't say the best but it's good. One thing which I don't like about the touch screen is FINGERPRINTS! Leaves lots of them so you'll have to clean it a lot . But it's not noticeable when ur working on it usually. The laptop doesn't heat when I'm just browsing or listening to music. Expect heating when gaming but it's not that big of deal for me. it charges preety fast but st the same time the battery drains out in just 3 hour or so. Quality is very good. Worth the money!
Overall go for it !; It's very nice but it heats a lot when gaming and it has a good touchscreen and so yea it's very good; Awesome, very good product, love to work with this laptop; Don‚Äôt buy this product it‚Äôs used one for electronics products I think one should avoid buying on Amazon this has happened before also; Worth for money. I'm enjoying the laptop. It's very fast and touch was perfect and very soft to use. But battery could have been better. It only stands for 3 to 4 hrs of heavy use and 5 to 6 hrs of movie experience.
Overall it's worth to buy.; All good..if you plan for laptop, you can go ahead with this model; It's a cheating where they are not giving the pen as described in the Amazon product page. This laptop is very nice but remember the space left to use in the model of 256 Gb SSD would be only 150 gb practically; Received laptop in good packing. Package contains active pen too. Only concern is the laptop imported in March 2023. So it's a one year old stock."

Beefy laptop with good performance.; Arrived today üòá excellent Product üí™üèªüí• but Wait ! come back after 4 weeks I'll shortly Update this review about pro and cons
Finally After some uses I'll update this review
Pro
1 Sound is loud enough to listen song or dialogue
2 Till now I haven't do coding or watching movies in this but only gaming and it's giving out very good performance 3050 doing its job playing GTA V on high graphics and giving 120 to 140 fps so don't worry about it
3 Display is good not the best cause it's ips and brightness is also good
4 built is very good and premium feels like business laptop and the logo is standing out
5 charging is very fast 200w charger y'll get with it
Cons
1 If you are in much wider area sound from speakers will not get into your ears that much but it's loud enough so don't worry
2 screen wobble is like too much just move a little bit it's wobbling not much people will get bother by this
3 Display is good but there is issue with the display if it is with my laptop only or all other also don't know but it's backlight bleeding if you google it y'll get it just in case screen bleeding means when ur screen goes full black green backlight you will see at every corner or 1, 2 corners of the display I'm trying to contacted hp care but it's not happening so i have to go physically to service center

Overall it's good laptop compared to price and specification
This is the normal review based on uses only if you want detail specification there are other reviews also; The HP Victus Gaming Laptop is a compelling choice for gamers on a budget who prioritize affordability and good performance for 1080p gaming. It offers a good balance of features and delivers a smooth gaming experience. However, if you prioritize factors like premium build quality, extensive upgradability, or silent operation.; I using for a month ,i didnt notice any problem
But may be you can disappoint at battery back up; I recently purchased the HP Victus Gaming Laptop from Amazon, and I must say I am thoroughly disappointed with my purchase. I had high hopes for this gaming laptop, but it has fallen far short of my expectations.

First and foremost, the battery life is abysmal. I expected a laptop with decent battery performance, but I can barely get it to last for more than 2 hours of simple usage. It's incredibly frustrating to have to constantly be tethered to a power source when I had hoped to use it on the go. This severely limits its portability and functionality.

Moreover, the laptop's performance is far from what I anticipated. With its 12th Gen Intel Core i5-12450H and NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU, I expected smooth gaming and multitasking capabilities. However, I've experienced significant lag and performance issues that make it nearly impossible to enjoy gaming or perform tasks efficiently. It's disheartening to invest in a so-called gaming laptop and have it struggle with even the most basic of tasks.

Adding to my disappointment, I've tried reaching out to Amazon's customer service team for assistance with these problems, but they have yet to arrive at my home after two weeks of waiting. The lack of timely customer support is incredibly frustrating and adds to the overall negative experience.

In conclusion, the HP Victus Gaming Laptop has been a letdown in every aspect. The short battery life, poor performance, and lack of effective customer support have made this purchase a regrettable one. I would not recommend this product to anyone, and I'm left feeling unsatisfied and frustrated with my Amazon shopping experience.; Build quality is fine , overall very good experience; Apart from build quality which does not seems to me great but in terms of every other thing...this product is best in class for every task. And most valuable for the range of 60k to 65k.

The Features it provides me at 61k,

‚Ä¢ Basic display with 144hz
‚Ä¢ Good CPU : Intel i5 12450H gaming Processor
‚Ä¢ Decent GPU: Nvidia Rtx 3050 with 75watts of TGP
‚Ä¢ 16GB DDR4 RAM/ 512 GB SSD
‚Ä¢ GOOD THERMALS
‚Ä¢ Professional design and slim build (plastic)
‚Ä¢ MS office life time for students
‚Ä¢ Good battry backup

‚Ä¢ Including all this feature in laptop The laptop has a great hardware features and professional looks but slightly decent build quality offered by VICTUS at a price for 60k at which other brands do little bit cost cutting at dispatch by giving 60hz penal and some brand provides low TGP. but this product belence every thing and still at the best price.

‚Ä¢ But nowdays If you can go Litt further than must buy acer Nitro V cuz it offers very great in segment features like no other brands gives to their leptops.
It's best product under 75k in any prespactive.

‚Ä¢ If you have slightly low budget than by aspire 7 with same spacifications but slightly lower TGP and some other ignorable drawbacks which doesn't worth mentioning.

But You have 60 to 65k than it's a great product to buy in fact 1st ranked. üòäüëçüèª‚ú®; This is my Third laptop
Laptop looks very elegant, the blue colour makes head turning

Overall experience is worth every penny"

The video quality is superb.
The heating problem is there.
Not compatible gaming as some of the game expected hardware is not available.
I am a music lover, so I was expecting the sound quality to be better as laptop loaded with 2W speakers.
The battery backup is good.; The Ideapad Slim 5, is a high-quality laptop, perfect for office use. It boasts excellent features, including i5, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. The speed is impressive, making it a strong recommendation for anyone in need of a reliable work companion.; Pros
Good build quality
Anti Glare works fine
Display is good
Charging is fast enough
Keyboard is very good
Backlight keys are well illuminated
Performance is good
Cons
Battery last 3 hrs at 65% brightness
Heating with normal usages
Heating on charging even in switched off
Display brightness is ok but it feels low sometimes.
No RJ45 connector; First of all thanks to Amazon for the fastest deliveries less than 24 hours with good shape.
Now on the laptop front superb finish love at first sight, it is a clean laptop with all the essential features. Top lid is of metal a premium quality laptop with precise cut at each and every corner. It is a 12th Generation i5 - 12450H processor laptop due to which no issues at the processing of task no matter what you give, it run as a breeze, no fingerprint sensor, no graphics card it had a internal graphics card which is terrible if you want this laptop for gaming purpose then do not purchase this. I have purchased this as i have no use of graphics card.

Pros:

ASPECT RATIO: 16:10 ( Major highlight which is helpful in Coding )
SCREEN : IPS Panel with 60Hz resolution with good viewing angle.
CHARGER: 65 Watt Charger with USB type C
FRONT CAM: 720p with privacy shutter.
SSD: 500 GB (with upgradable option)
TRACK PAD : Very nice wide and smooth scroll with good tactile feedback.
BACKLITE KEYBOARD : YES

Cons:

RAM: 16 GB ( not upgradable this is a major downside of this laptop which is so expensive)
HDD: ( no slot for HDD )
FINGERPRINT : NO
GRAPHICS CARD: Inbuilt

HEATING ISSUE:

Most important due to which I gave it a less rating since Lenovo knows it is a H series processor therefore vents should be cut out at the side end of the laptop but at present the vent is at the screen & bottom end due to which when performing high priority tasks it becomes hot as it is clocked at base 2.0 Ghz the keyboard area becomes hot and due to vents placed at screen side screen & metal lid becomes hot not that much hot but still a premium laptop Ideapad 5 series should not have this kind of issues. During benchmark test the keyboard area becomes serious hot and the screen area the right bottom area becomes hot due to vent throwing air at the screen.; Pros:
Look is amazing
16 GB ram is good enough for advanced multitasking
Light weight

Cons:
No FPR; Battery drainage issue üò≠. I have High expectations on this. Literally so frustrated.
When we are on meetings when we turn on camera falsh light automatically turns on and no option to turn it off . So frustrating we can't concentrate on anything else if it keep disturbing our eyes.

This is good 14inch laptop, lightweight, with Ms office pre-installed. On board memory limited to 8gb is an issue if you use memory hogging programs. Audio quality very bad. Very low volume a big disappointment. Otherswise quality of the product is good as expected for ASUS. Battery life is better than the previous laptop guess it is due to lp processor and lpdram. Display is good and camera performance satisfactory. Keyboard and touchpad good.keyborad could have been backlite ü•∫my score is 3.5 mainly due to low volume.; I have recently bought the Asus Vivobook 16 and I must say it's a very good budget laptop for daily basic usage and especially for a student like me. It's Intel i3 1215u processor handles basic tasks like PPT presentation Excel and net surfing very easily. It also has a decent display of 16 inches to watch movies and videos on.
It also offers a fingerprint scanner which is a very good thing in a budget laptop. One thing which I think is missing is the backlit keyboard at this price point otherwise the laptop is very nice and I would recommend you to buy it for daily usage and basic gaming ( Not heavy games like pubg gta v etc); i had ordered this product last week and received bad product which was not switching on , had to return the laptop , had to go through lot of issues and 100s of calls to and fro between ASUS and Amazon , struggled to return , now am re-ordering lets see what i receive and now the product price has increased from 39990 to 40990 , amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! , first i received a faulty product and then i see the same product price is increased ... how shameful ... please dont send a faulty product this time AMAZON , pleaes dont harass customers also while returning the product; Pros
1. OLED Screen: Awesome screen. True to life media consumption.
2. Processor: 12th gen U category i3 processor. Battery efficient and powerful processor.
3. Ram : 16gb upgradable. More than enough ram for work ,productivity and games as well.
4. 90hz screen so very smooth experience

Cons
1. Battery last for 4-5 hours on normal usage.
2. Plastic built so use carefully.
3. Camera is 720p so not good for a lot of meetings.; According to the budget you get really good laptop. Considering the price it is value for money.
Pros:
1) The display is top notch feeling viewing angles are really good that will never disappoint you
2) it has decent battery capacity considering the high resolution screen it is giving me around 4.5hrs approximately
3) Processor and user interface is really fluid combined with that 90hz .....it is very good for day to day usages
Cons :
1) If you want a laptop with atleast mediocre sound quality this is not for you because the sound it produces is very very low you can't even hear to any songs or movies
2) so if you are willing to sacrifice the sound just for high resolution screen just go head if not just choose any other brand
People who loves sound just don't buy this one you can't even hear single thing from it
(For Sound ..........it is just waste of money don't buy I repeat don't even consider this laptop go for better sound producing laptops ); Laptop is sleek with good performance.
Everything is good but there's been heating issue while charging and using it at the same time. Battery backup is average.; I bought this product in Jan 2024, overall it's decent laptop in this price (for me 42k). I'm moderate user, not use any heavy software. My previous device was quite old (2014), so for me this one is really fast. It boots quickly and apps load in no time e.g. Gimp, Chrome.
Battery life is around 5 hours with internet.
Camera quality can be improved.
In 4 months usage I haven't faced any issues so far.; It's a good laptop with average display. The Wifi/Bluetooth modules doesn't work with Linux. Battery runs about 4 Hrs of normal browsing and multimedia playback.

Happy with its performance.; Performance and Touch Screen (Model 2041TU) is excellent and the metal body gives a premium look. Battery is not that great, but not bad. Value for money in this price range.; ; Since 1st it's giving lot of heat..it's all waste of money for this laptop. There's no proper response from the support team. All cheating only.. I am not at all satisfied with this.. I suggest everyone not to buy this product...; Value for money but mouse and laptop to be given along with laptop.; The Product actually shipped by Computronics Multivision was HP 14-dv2014TU which per HP website is actually costs Rs 67000- so Amazon is more expensive by Rs 1700 .
The product ordered as per website was HP 14 dv 2041 TU which in Reliance digital is Rs 700 lesser than on Amazon
Product is light but you feel that the keyboard buttons are loose and feel the spring each time you type . Screen pixel quality is average , the speed is decent though I keep getting an runtime error each time I try to register the HP warranty . Overall there is NO touch screen as put out in AMAZON . The original product does NOT feature a touch screen and Amazon needs to be careful before showing such features that swing the decision in favour of this product . Overall not a bad buy but not a touch screen; HP never disappoints; The product is good and useful for everyday work"

With its Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD, it offers smooth performance for day-to-day tasks like web browsing, office work, and even some lightweight photo and video editing.

I was pleased by how lightweight and slim the aluminum alloy body feels. The CoreBook is easy to carry around the house or toss in a bag to take on the go. The narrow bezels surrounding the 14.1-inch 1080p screen give it a modern look and allow for a compact footprint overall.

The backlit keyboard feels snappy and responsive when typing. I was able to type quickly and accurately thanks to the well-spaced layout. The large clickable trackpad is also accurate and smooth. Battery life is fairly strong as well. I got close to 8 hours of mixed usage on a single charge consisting of web browsing, streaming video, and document editing. This should get most users through a full work or school day without issue.

Considering its combination of performance hardware, premium metal body, backlit keyboard, and competitive battery life, the asking price of around 24000/- INR feels like an incredible value. For budget-minded buyers who still want power and build quality, the Chuwi CoreBook is easy to recommend. It punches well above its class and serves as a capable daily driver laptop for work, school, and general use.; Con... - Kabhi Kabhi touch pad Kam Nahi Kar Raha hai,scrin bliding problem hai,3 speaker hai right side se jyada awaj a Raha hai left side Ka spiker kafi jyada slow hai , Display ko fold kar√±e par display bliding jyada ho Raha hai, displa flex ho Raha hai ,pixal press ho raha hai, software ko hardware ke sath Acha se optimise Nahi Kiya Gaya hai,Kabhi Kabhi software Acha se Kam Nahi Kar Raha hai,touch and ky BHI Kam Nahi Kar Raha hai,restart kar√±e par thik ho Raha hai .

Rating 4.1
Price- 21000/; Configuration is just AWESOME and the laptop too. I have placed order during one day Festival Day offer. Got excellent Discount up to 5k. Unfortunately, laptop is not getting switched on after use for 10-20min. I thought its due to no charge, tried to switch ON using both charger and C type, but no. Otherwise, design of the laptop, performance, look, color, all very very good. When I spoke to customer support I have not got Replacement option due to no stock.; This thin, affordable laptop is a gem. Its portability is unmatched, making it perfect for on-the-go tasks. The trackpad is responsive, ensuring seamless navigation. With Windows 11, the user experience is top-notch. The 512GB SSD and 8GB RAM provide ample storage and smooth multitasking. It's a steal for the price, striking a balance between affordability and performance. Ideal for work and daily use, this laptop proves you don't need to break the bank for quality. If you crave a budget-friendly, portable powerhouse, this is your go-to device.; 1stly - the price. Got it on sale for ‚Çπ21k, and as someone who works in the dark all the time, finding a laptop at this price that has a Backlit Keyboard is a dream come true.

2ndly - Keyboard and mouse trackpad. Keyboard is backlit and has two brightness levels when on - medium and high. Medium is good enough, high might eat more battery. Just an observation, the backlight will be off everytime you boot up, regardless of what it was set to before. Key press virtually soundless, and feel soft; very similar to dell keyboards. Mouse trackpad is as smooth as Macbooks. Gestures all work nicely, and multi-finger scrolls and swipes are all silky smooth.

3rdly - Battery life. Been getting almost 3 to 4 hours on full charge with mostly for work - Excel, 4 to 5 Chrome tabs, and a couple background apps running.

4thly - Upgradable RAM. YES! It's motherboard comes with unremovable 8gb RAM, and an empty DDR4 SO-DIMM Laptop RAM slot. 8+8gb is more than enough to turn this into a mini performance beast with absolutely no lag at all with the included Windows 11 OS. Just make sure to double check the built-in 8gb RAM's MHz speed and match it accordingly. In my case, I went with G.Skill's 3200MHz CL-22 8GB SO-DIMM Laptop RAM stick.

5thly - Windows 11. Microsoft has finally nailed it with their OS. This is coming from someone who absolutely abhorred Win10 so much, and shifted to MacOS in 2015, and now switching back to Win11. Needed a quick and budget laptop 'cause my 13"" rMacbook Pro's screen fully cracked, and I must say, I was pleasantly pleased with how buttery smooth everything is, similar to MacOS if not better. Actually, it is better, given all the extra things Windows could always let you do, but now with all that extra smoothness. Took me about 15 minutes, to set everything up, and get it looking as close as possible to classic Windows UI (harken back to them peaceful XP days).

6thly - Build quality is great. Feels and looks premium. Very mild wobbling, but the hinges feel stable and sturdy. Underside has one long vent for airflow and two speaker vents. Laptop isn't rated for any kind of water protection, but I must mention that it ended up getting quite wet, if not soaked in the December 2023 Chennai floods. The laptop was in my messenger bag and the bag fell completely submerged in water. Didn't switch it on for 2 weeks, removed the battery and kept it in a bucket of dry rice(yes that old ""hack"") along with the charger as well, gently wiped off any visible wetness on the momboard, closed up and dried the machine in the sun a few hours everyday, put it all back together after 2 weeks, booted up with much suspense, and it all works as usual despite everyone(online and support) saying otherwise. Altho there were visible water spots under the screen, after almost 2 months now it has dried and reduced 95% on its own.

7thly - Performance. Now, don't go expecting to use this for high end gaming, get a console for that. For minimal, and light gaming it works great. Installed Need For Speed Most Wanted 2005 and just completed it again after many years. Worked flawlessly on max graphics settings - was getting 60fps with slight dips in framerate when the screen gets a little busy.

Lastly - Service & Support. The Chuwi support was quite responsive through WhatsApp. Upon first boot, it showed Win11 wasn't activated and panic started kicking in. Before I kicked myself any further, tried reaching out to Chuwi support. They wanted to send a technician over to activate it which would've taken a day or two - my impatience meant I couldn't and wouldn't wait at all. Took a bit of back and forth messaging on WhatsApp, but they eventually sent over the Product Key to activate Windows, and I easily did it myself pretty quick. In the case of local servicing, they have designated technicians in each city with whom they've tied up with to provide service.; ; When I got the book, I was surprised by the IPS screen. I never saw suck a 2K beautiful screen at this price level. Neither HP, Dell, nor Lenovo can provide suck an excellent screen. It is very comfortable to read the news or watch videos on it even under sunlight in the afternoon.
The CPU is as same as the one used in the old MacBook (2018), but it can provide enough power for daily use as an Ultrabook. I did not see any lag when I use it for internet surfing and office work.
8 GB memory is also good enough for office work. But sometimes when I run large data set for analysis, I can feel a bit of RAM shortage. But thanks to the high-speed SSD drive, the virtual memory helps a lot. And there are two RAM slots in the motherboard. It will help the ram expansion if it is necessary for the future.
The SSD hard drive is 512GB. Its capacity is twice times bigger than other laptops at this price level. There is enough space for me.
The keyboard is also excellent. I almost have the same feeling on it as on my old MacBook. The keys can light up in the dark. I love this keyboard after one month of typing on it.
Here is what I like
1. Excellent screen and keyboard,
2. Fast and large SSD drive,
3. Lightweight.
What I do not like
1. Not PD charging.
2. Only 5-6 hours battery power.
3. Not for gaming, not for large data analysis.; I got this laptop as a gift for my dad to replace his 7yr old Lenovo. I was a bit wary at first of this brand, but I was willing to try it, as the main brands were selling new laptops with old components at a high price due to the supply shortage.

This laptop is great for just slipping in your bag and heading out. It‚Äôs very thin, super lightweight, and has a pretty sturdy metal construction.

I got it primarily for running Inkscape, but it may do a bit of light gaming at low settings.

I love the 3:2 aspect ratio, and the 2K resolution really pops out. It also is able to display more on the smaller screen due to the higher pixel density.

Speaking of the small screen, the 14‚Äù (I think it‚Äôs closer to 13.6‚Äù) panel is a bit of a downgrade if you‚Äôre used to bigger screens. If you‚Äôre looking for a 15‚Äù or above, this isn‚Äôt the laptop for you.

One downside of such a thin laptop is a lack of I/O ports. It has one USB-A 3 port and a 3.5mm headset jack on the right side, and one USB-C port on the left. The charging port is also on the left side, and this laptop does not support USB-C power delivery.

If you want to output to an external display or connect more than one flash drive, you‚Äôll need a USB-C dock. But these minor problems are to be expected with such a thin laptop.

Now, it may just be me, but I thought the keyboard felt very cheap. It had a bit of play around each key, and I did not enjoy the typing experience. I think it may have been the switched the manufacturer used in the laptop, but I figured it was acceptable in a non-mainstream laptop.

I noticed that the metal skin of the laptop picked up smudges and fingerprints rather easily. Not a dealbreaker for me.

If you are looking for an aggressively decent laptop that looks a bit like a MacBook Air, this is the one for you.; I was very surprised by the value of this laptop in this price range. I bought it to see if it was as good as other reviews said it was. I had in mind to try it and return it if necessary. After a few days of use, I knew I was definitely keeping it. I was amazed at the great screen resolution. The audio is surprisingly very good. Very happy with the battery life and speed of the processor. It's light and sleek. The only thing that concerned me initially, is having only 1 USB port. So far no problem. I'll just get an adapter if needed. I Never heard of this brand, but this is truly a great buy on a laptop.; Cheap metal, 1 mega pixel front camera, 1 single usb port, no HDMI slot, no SD card slot, buggy touchpad, 1.5 hr max battery life, overheats easily, not for light gaming. But worst of all 2 months after use it starts making a high pitch when running, making it impossible to keep using it without getting a headache. Seller would not reimburse or accept return. Buy name brands dont waste your money on this.; Most of the time that I am about to buy something from a brand that I don't know, I get very suspicious. This computer has been one of the best purchases I have ever done here on amazon. The computer is fast, and the screen is very bright. It is also very light and perfect for me to take to school. I would say that this computer maybe can run some games, but not the high-end ones because you will need a better GPU. I don't think you will find a better deal than this computer."

Many things about this laptop surprised me like no laptop ever has. I no longer need a separate tablet with an OLED screen. The quality of the screen, the colors and detail will blow your mind. The build quality is supreme, solid sturdy and the performance is out of this world. Granted its a new laptop so it will take a few months of updates to make sure it runs even more smoothly, you might have a few hiccups with Windows from time to time but these are mostly related to software optimization. Battery life is stellar and the tablet experience is very enjoyable. I love the webcam and cant complain as its the best webcam I've ever seen on a laptop, crystal clear and sharp. The touchpad is phenomenal, very large and better than many mac touchpads I've tried. For the first time, I feel like HP has put together break through device design and engineering going head to head with ultra premium macbooks. Side note for those interested- you can upgrade the SSD on this laptop to 4TB but it is not officially supported. A 4TB drive is thicker (in height) and the height of the laptop is designed for 2TB max I guess. My 4TB works fine but it touches the baseplate and makes it bulge a little but it works flawlessly. HP have set a whole new standard for the portable PC with this one.; I dont know if it is windows 11 or the laptop itself, but it restarts on its own when put to sleep"

This is where we find difficult in the new companies and Amazon must look into this type issues.

Purchased on 29th June 2023
I don't find a dislike since 10 - 14 days using this product at this price.
My niece is happy to have it.
Battery backup is good, have tested myself, 50% went upto 2 hours.
Windows is activated by the manufacturers and thus only had to run the new updates only.
Hope it gives a good service in the future, Some preloaded files were there at the document folder - hope it was some part of ghost file to upload windows.

The only thing for this generic branding I think is to handle with care -
1. Always charge properly - ie do not let it go down below 18% and also do not overcharge.
2. Always do keep a wooden platform underneath while using on bed, it do not have exhaust fan on CPU.

Overall, a one can go for this for low end usage.

Thanks to the seller.; Need service centre contact number... It's poor product. Many issues in the laptop. So don't recommend...; The laptop is a great bulid as per its price. Enough for normal browsing and a little gaming. Do not expect it to do wonders. I bought for my kids school, good looking laptop and enough battery. Windows preinstalled is great. As you have to setup it gives a feeling of ownership. Light weight

The con and drawback is the display Panal is only 60fps so more fps is useless. Would suggest people to buy it if it's for medium gaming and easier carrying due to its weight. I won't recommend this laptop for dedicated gaming tho; ; I boght this laptop for mainly multitasking and virtualization purpose, 16GB version was not available so bought 8 GB version(4x2), then I upgraded it to 32 GB crucial RAM, overall super performance and smooth no lags, installed linux alongside windows, NVMe PCIe gen 3 SSD provided and speed is also good see the speedtest image attached, I bought it for around Rs 52K after bank discount and old laptop exchange offer

here are the pros and cons of this laptop
Pros:
1) 12th gen CPU 1240P, 12 cores/16 threads ( total 16 Virtual processors).
2) Total 2 NVMe slots, 1st slot is PCIe gen 4 NVMe supported, 2nd slot PCIe gen 3).
3) backlit keyboard
4) Thunderbolt 4 supported
5) NVidia RTX 2050 with this price is worth
6) Fingerprint scan is fast

Cons:
1) Battery backup is not upto mark(around 2.5 Hrs) and sound is ok
2)Display is just normal 60Hz 1080P
3) 8GB RAM is 4x2 ( not future proof)
4) out of 2 SSD slots only 1 PCIe 4
5) No SD/microsd slot
6) No mux switch; Expected more speed from Intel i7, screens not flexible to 180 degree, rest of all good; I purchased this laptop for Rs. 46,240 during the 2023 Great Indian Festival Sale. From my perspective, here are the pros and cons:

Pros:

1. Inclusion of an i5 processor within this price range.
2. The RTX-2050 provides excellent value for money.
3. It's a lightweight laptop.
4. Impressive overall performance.

Cons:

1. The build quality is primarily plastic.
2. The keyboard feedback is subpar.
3. Lack of a Type-C charger.
4. Sound quality is unsatisfactory.
5. The label and printed information on the laptop battery appear different, raising suspicions of whether the product may be refurbished.; Ok ok .my one i bought one its battery stopped working within 2 days, then i ordered it again thats mother board stopped working within 12 days,and i couldn't return it as amazon hives only 7 days replacement,so finally after months of requesting and calling, i decided to get it repaired.that they did very fast and currently its working well.; The laptop is good for this price point.
First Day review.
1) Noticed that in multi core performance mode the max cpu frequency was around 2.57Ghz. I think this might be some bios issue. Where as in single core mode cpu runs at its full clock speed (4.1Ghz).
2) The laptop fan has zero noise at low load and when cpu runs at its high clock speed the noise is a bit loud (not very loud).
3) R23 cinebench single core :1657
multi core : 6200
4)Speakers and battery backup are mediocre.
5) Ram 4+4 GB ok dual channel, better than single 8 GB but problem upgrading wise.

After 3 days ( installing windows updates and drivers)
1) cinebench multicore test : 8500 pts.
2) single core : 1650 pts
3) Battery backup increased to 4-5 hrs. (good battery life)
4)Thermals are outstanding max 75¬∞C (during 4-5 hr stretch)
5) Loving this laptop so far.; Cpu 12th gen i5 with 12 core (8efficient+4high perf)
Nvidia rtx series gddr6 4gb gpu perfect mid ranger
Storage is Western digitals brand fitted
Panasonic 3cell 50whr battery
Wifi and bt is Intel
Audio is realtek
Ethernet is Atheros branded.
Thunderbolt 4 type USB c 3.2 generation 4
Usb 3.2 pen drive if connected it can transfer upto 1gb/s copy speed. I tested.
Windows 11 optimum speed and battery balanced as compared to 10. So this pc is good
I bought for 47k,
Adapter 90w medium speed charging...0-100 in 1hour 20mins around..battery is good capacity unlike other brands don't give 50ah, others have 30-40 only
First I compared with Lenovo, it has 11th gen only cpu, also gpu nvidia GTX only. So this pc same price they provide...so this acer is very discounted price brand.

Only negative is touch pad not soo fast..it slow..but works...better use external mouse...perfect...

Every laptop has pros and cons.. this laptop touch pad little low sensitivity...little over heat only..because gpu is there when we play games...
If you are expert go for this GPU pc, otherwise go for non GPU pc"

I am so much happy to get this type of gadget from Samsung.
Battery is good.
Camera quality is also good.; The laptop is decent. But compared to my old MacBook Air, it is quite heavy. Doesn't feel like a light laptop.

Also, because of metal body, it warms up very quickly. If it was a plastic body like other brands, you wouldn't feel the heat.

The laptop box I received had already seal broken, so I am not sure if I got a returned or refurbished product. Disappointed because of this, but there is no evidence of prior use.

Overall, it's fine. Been using it for 2 days. Fingerprint unlock is a nice feature. Screen is okay, some light bleed. Should have been an OLED screen for this much money.

For Rs 65k, it is expensive. Overpriced for a average performance laptop.

If anyone can get this for around 50k-55k during one of the great sales, it would be an awesome deal.; I've been using the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Core i7 13th Gen for a while now, and I can't help but share my thoughts on this impressive machine. This laptop has been a game-changer for me, and here's why:

Performance: This laptop is a powerhouse. It handles everything I throw at it with ease. Whether I'm working on multiple tasks, editing photos, or enjoying some light gaming, the Core i7 processor handles it all without breaking a sweat. It's like having a reliable workhorse at my fingertips.

Build Quality: The build quality is top-notch. It feels sturdy and well-crafted. I love the sleek design, and it's surprisingly lightweight, making it easy to carry around. The backlit keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the touchpad is responsive.

Screen Display: The screen is a real showstopper. The colors are vibrant, and the display technology is a significant improvement. Whether I'm watching movies or working on detailed projects, the screen is a pleasure to look at. It's also great for outdoor use, thanks to its high brightness & anti-glare screen.

In summary, the Samsung Galaxy Book3 Core i7 13th Gen has exceeded my expectations. It's a reliable companion for both work and play. If you're looking for a laptop that offers outstanding performance, durability, and a stunning display, this is a fantastic choice. I highly recommend it!; Laptop performance is fine.
Display is very nice.
Initially I felt sound very low..after enabling dolby atmos, sound is fine.; Just 2 months of purchase nd this happens

And now am just looking / searching here and there for a Samsung service centre

Bad quality product; Everything is good but the speaker quality is very bad; Well Writing This After Using It For 3Days

Pro's
Display The Highlighting FACTOR 5/5üî•
Build Quality,Highly Premium 5/5üî•
Light Weight,And Littrely Too Slimüî•
Performance:Best In the business 5/5üî•

Conclusion:I Got It For 60K After Applying All The Offers, So For Me It's Simply The Great Value For Money.. If You Are A Premium Professional Person,
Then You Can Blindly Go With This..
If You Know Who Is the real Competitor of
IOS & Mac....üòå; The build quality of the product is extremely poor. The screen is pasted to a panel that comes off within a few months (I bought in Nov-2023, and am posting review in May-2024). Samsung calls this wear tear / physical damage and doesn't cover it under warranty. Service engineer will give you an estimate of Rs10K. Attached pictures give you an idea of the state of my laptop in 6 months despite extremely careful handling!

This isn't exactly a cheap laptop. Better to either:
a) buy a cheap Chinese brand and save money since the Samsung warranty is meaningless
b) Put some extra money and buy an Apple - Atleast you get the quality you pay for!"

It's hands down the best powerful laptop & premium design looks with latest 13th gen i9 Intel EVO H-series processor + 16GB DDR5 + 1TB SSD + 2.8k OLED Display + 75whr battery!! & That too i got at 89k seems impossible tbh (prime day sale was pure blessing for me‚úåÔ∏èüòé).
I had to choose between Macbook Air M1 v/s Vivobook S15 & after brainstorming all pros n cons S15 is the clear cut winner under ‚Çπ1L price segment!!

Pros:
1. Powerful i9 (20threads)- so handle multitasks like peice of cake
2. 16gb DDR5 - r/w speed 4800Mhz - context switch is pretty smooth & fast!!
3. 1tb ssd- faster access & hell lot of storage (unless you've tons of movies, study materials;)
4. OLED Display is the USP of S15. I use it for almost 14hrs/day but cuz of eye protection mode, blue light shield & other stable parameters I don't feel any strain in my eyesüëÄ‚ú®
5. High battery capacity of 75Whr. It's Intel EVO so battery life is easily 8-10hrs I get. Supports fast charging. It takes max to max 2hrs for full charge (from 15 to 100%).
6. Light weight so feels quite handy.
7. Full keypad (backlit), huge trackpad + touch unlock(win hello feature), strong wifi 6E.
8. Awesome sound s/m by Harman/kardon(atleast better then prev versions) + Dolby Atmosüé∂
9. Pre-installed win 11 + Life time Ms office21 + (extra 2yrs warenty extension offer at ‚Çπ999).
10. No heating issue at all!! (Idk why People complaining about too much heating.. I use it for almost whole day with extensive cpu bound tasks but doesn't felt heat even for single time. While charging also it doesn't heatup much. I'm sure these people either would have playing graphics intensive games on this laptop or doesn't know how to handle a device efficiently). Also it is equipped with extreme cooling mechanism.
11. I didn't knew that latest Intel iris xe graphics handles visualization tools & ML projects efficiently.
12. Strong built (as it claims military grade testedüí™üèª)
13. Boot time is super quick ~ 2-3sec (ofc due to Intel EVO)
14. HD webCam with privacy Sutter.

Bonus:
-The box contain cute DIY laptop stand too, along with unnecessary swag stickersüòÖ
-Asus & Apple provides this thin cloth between keyboard & screen to cover

Cons:
-dedicated graphics (atleast rtx 3050) would have made this laptop the king among all.
-No RAM upgradibility
-req atleast 2/3 Usb3.0
-other minute issues can be ignorable (cuz love is blindüôà & also No device is 'sarv gun sampann')

Ps- if anyone can get it below 90k then it's a stellar deal. Cuz i9 H-series is never possible under 1Lakh & Intel EVO laptops are only for premium top-notch devices!!; After 2 weeks of purchase iam writing this review Battery backup is good, performance is also good no lags,but sometimes fingerprint sensor is not capturing.with 65w charger around one and half an hour it is full charged.spekaers also good but not loud.; This protect is an amazing anti creative production from Asus brand... I already started loving it has been more than the month it feels very smooth and premium to handle.... I definitely personally recommend this laptop with this configuration at this rate... Definitely by win win situation... One issue I face is that the sound is very very less has the speaker is at the back side of the laptop; ; Good Quality
Budjet friendly
High speed
Camera Quality is medium
Screen performance is good
Sound Quality is good
Key board is good; After using 4-5months, I like this Laptop very much due to its excellent display & superfast i-9 processor.

Here are a few things I enjoy and don't like.

The Thinkbook was the last model I saw while I was shopping for a laptop to buy, and I kind of loved all the specs in this price range. When compared to every other brand with the same specifications, this appeared to be a great deal.

I didn't know this till after I bought the laptop, but out of all the features I appreciate, the speaker is among the worst. For the past two years, I have been using my friend's HP laptop, which has the best speaker ever‚Äîit produces great sound even when it is only half loud. Please cross this laptop off the list if you're searching for one with nice speakers.

I've now noticed that the screen brightness is the next drawback. In all of the screens, I always use the lowest possible screen brightness. I would always use '0' on the same HP laptop because that is my ideal brightness level; however, with this laptop, I had to use at least two levels.

Other than the two drawbacks mentioned above, I haven't had any difficulties. Once I've used it for a while, I'll update the long-term review.

If any of you utilize this laptop, kindly share any positive and negative aspects with us.; This product for suppose to be a gift for my mom but turned to be a nightmare. Ever this product was delivered my mom has been trying to turn the new piece on but the display shows a blank a screen. Just a heads up the battery is fully charged. On speaking with amazon they said have a word with Lenovo on it.
Lenovo has been throwing tantrums that contact the supplier. It seems that nobody is ready to take the responsibility and busy playing blame games. Lenovo promised to send technician on calling Monday morning but I get a simple email from them that the serial number doesn‚Äôt match the invoice hence contact supplier. Though over the call they did say that the technician will come over and check the invoice soft copy. My parents are in their 60‚Äôs Amazon take up the responsibility and issue a replacement. As it‚Äôs not my parents mistake that the product turned out to be defective but they are facing the consequences for it.; I think that this is the cheapest laptop with a Ryzen 7730U Processor, 8 GB RAM and a Fingerprint Sensor. I purchased this for my father, who likes his gadgets to be as future-proof as possible. This laptop is priced at under 50K, and at that you get a sturdy workhorse of a machine.

Pros
- Very sturdy build. Laptop looks so pleasant and elegant.
- Keyboard is classic Lenovo. Very good typing experience, backlight is available in 3 modes: off, low and high.
- Up gradability: You can add another RAM, and the 512GB SSD can be swapped for a 1TB in the long run.
- Charges using USB port, but doesn't charge via phone/tablet chargers. I tried my 33W Xiaomi Adapter as well as my OnePlus 100W Adapter. Neither worked. But the laptop's charger charges my phone and tablet just fine. It's a good option as it charges in 4 Voltages: 5V, 9V, 15V and 20V.
- Fingerprint Sensor works like a charm.
- Webcam is more than acceptable.

Cons
- This laptop does NOT come with Windows 11 Preinstalled. You need to install it on your own.
- During Windows 11 installation, I felt the laptop heating a bit, the heat seeps through the keyboard, and you feel it near the WASD keys. I didn't experience this issue during regular use though.
- If you charge the Laptop while using it, even for casual tasks, it takes a bit longer to charge.

To sum it up, if you want the Lenvo reliability and a good processor, all under 50K, this one is where your search ends.; Best product for daily office use; Sound quality is worst üò©.
Overall performance is good.; ; Good laptop in budget but if u want see it's real performance upgrade ram to 16gb buy and u can play pubg g in 1080p in 60 to 81 fps but I don't suggest it I just check and I have to video editing also only screen is con other than that everything is super in this budget"

I bought it for under 1 lakh with exchange and card discounts.

Pros :
1. Processor is 13500HX which beats 12th gen i9. Future proof and can handle all the tasks with ease. Writing this review after a month of usage

2. GPU RTX 4050 : it is getting better with each driver updates and is able to outperform other 3070 ti laptops. Plus with DLSS 3 it gives you more than 165 fps in most games which support it which is in fact the future of all games. Ive seen reviews with raw performance and i dont know why do you not use a feature if you have been given that is DLSS 3. Also as the GPU is full 140w tgp hence will get better over time with updates.

3. Memory : it has 16gb DDR5 ram and SSD read speed is around 7000 which i did not expect, its on par with samsung SSDs.

4. Screen : the screen is 16 inch WUXGA which is good and also has the best colours 100% sRGB.

Thermals are great and the screen can be lifted with one finger. Also the keypad has a nice feel along with a big touchpad. Battery is also great for a gaming laptop, around 4-5 hours of usage if you are not gaming

Cons :

1. The back of the laptop is a fingerprint magnet, though you could clean it with a microfiber cloth.

2. The fans get loud if you run on turbo mode and yes it feels like it‚Äôs raining outside, that level of sound. But thats what keeps the thermals always below 80. I run on performance mode which is a balance of fan and the usage. 4050 isnt anyway running full wattage now so we dont need to run it for getting more performance right now but would help in future.

Overall i feel good about the purchase and will update the review if i face any issues, none so far in a month. Acer predator series is underrated and should take the market this year with the great pricing.; It's a good laptop if you have a good room in which dust is less then it's fan works good and thermals are great. I got issue with fan because of the dust stuck in it. Display is very good. Battery life is very average like it doesn't perform like 90w/hr. The display hinge feels lose idk why but overall build quality is very sturdy. I will suggest you to buy i7 Variant 1Tb SSD at 95k -1 lakh price range; Pros: you get everything latest in this laptop
16gb Ddr5 ram slot
512gb Gen 4 ssd slot
Rtx 4050 6gb 140w max tgp
Intel i5 13th gen HX series processor
90wh battery is pretty good.
Better cooling and air flow hence better thermals and perf.

Cons: rtx 40 series is currently capped at 100w but it competes with 3060 and is power efficient so, and most of the games do not have DLSS frame gen capability.
Top is metal and rest is plastic but build quality is good since it's a predator lineup.

I would suggest this is the best price for a laptop in India with such features loaded.; This is my fist laptop and i am a tech guy just loved it overall, it nails the looks for a gamming laptop, it is pretty sturdy in terms of quality, the thermals are out of the world it won' go above 70 degree in high performance to
Battery life is good but could have been better if you are using it for content consumption battery is good
It is a little bit more on the heavy side so its hard to carry withh the whole charger
But performance wise no issues smoothness is over the top works in every field and it is a beast; This is the best laptop at this price point with incredible thermals. Most of the laptops with good hardware don't perform well or worn-out early because of poor thermals. Predator helios neo 16 is a monster of its own world."

Positives:
Display is very good!
Keyboard/track pad is fine, num pad can be confusing and takes time getting used to
Graphics card Nvidia 4050 is good, it is 50W(not mentioned in the specs), adequate for most games
CPU is 12th Gen 12450H is good for most of the tasks

Build quality seems to be fine
Comes with MS office
thumbprint scanner is present and fast
Negatives:
Sound Quality is good, but volume is very low, this is the most disappointing thing to me you have to keep volume very high to listen to voice (Buy only if you use headphones)
Battery backup is low, max 2 to 3 hours Hours
Extra slot not present for additional drive, in my view 512GB is not adequate for creators/ gaming laptop
Laptop is heavy it is slightly higher than 2Kg(I only have a 2Kg scale so could not measure it accurately), it is mentioned as 1.8Kg, which is not correct.
web cam is average, privacy shutter is there!
RAM is DDR4; Its been 2 weeks since i purchased this laptop after just 1 week it started having issues regarding Bluetooth connectivity..my earbuds/ headphones keeps getting connected and disconnected on its own ..as its a very new laptop i asked asus company to replace it but they said its more than i week so not possible but we will get it repaired..it got repaired for 2 times but still facing this issue ....and they are not even replacing it not getting repaired perfectly and telling me its a minor issue its okay..

I bought this on 30/05/2021 , received it on 02/06/2021 and I am writing this review on 07/06/2021.
1) First of all I would say that this 14 inch laptop has the Ethernet port which all other competitors do not offer.
2) There is antiglare screen in the laptop not mentioned in specifications.
3) And yeah it has two GPUs one the Intel Iris and the other NVIDIA MX350 just told for those who think that iris will not be there just like i thought. However I have not tested the GPU performance as I am not a gaming person I bought this laptop so that I can run heavy softwares on it such as MATLAB.
4) Talking of the battery I felt the battery is decent as i do not have to charge it much as of now.
5) The Kingston SSD and the 11th gen core i5 make this computer super fast, the bios time is approx only 2.5 secs. Almost any application launches in few seconds.
6) The laptop looks and feels premium in hand. The build quality is fine in my opinion as i tried some force in the wrist area ,keyboard and there is no bending of the plastic, however the Aluminium lid bends a little bit when force applied.
7) The display is fine for me however i felt it could have been a little better but that's not an issue.
8) The camera is not very good to do video calls with your family and friends but yeah you can do meetings with no problems.

Overall the laptop is worth buying if you think you need some heavy programs to run on it such as MATLAB, Android Studio and many more and you have tight budget and need many features.; Pros:
Display is good
Specs are goos in budget (got in 57k)

Cons :
Keyboard and touchpad not that good,feels low quality
Battery average and sound camera average too.
Performance is good due to processor,
Screen hinge are not strong, might get damaged if not handled carefully

Hint : there is no return option, only replacement available for this laptop
I am keeping it as its in budget. If you want all in one then go for surface 4 laptop. (1 lakh); Performance - good
Light weight - yes
Build quality - good
Screen quality - good
Battery life : good
Camera - ok. Not so good quality
Audio - ok. Not loud.
For moderate usage : no heating issue.

Camera and Audio are of acceptable quality. Rest all good. Value for money.; Hello all, i am reviewing my laptop after usage of 5 days, i got this masterpiece on 20th june. From past 2months it was in my cart but didnt bought coz it is newly launched on Amazon. So waiting for some reviews and finally i ordered it on 14th june and after getting it n using it i am jst thinking y i waited for 2 months to order this stunning Laptop/Notebook.
Its is so light weight that u easily carry it in js ur 2 fingers.,
I used to charge it fully in morning b4 starting my offce work for calculating the battery backup of it, it usually takes 2 hr to fully charge , i jss shoked by seeing the results, it is giving me around 8 to 9 hrs of battery backup with power saving mode, and without its giving 6 to 7 hrs.
Full hd Display is really stunning, amazing experience with its screen quality. It is more clearer, brighter, sharper. And way better than asus display which is used by my brother.
Gaming experience is also good as it having 2gb NVIDIA MX 350 dedicated GRAPHICS Card.
I highly recommend this for everyone whose bget is in this range. I get it for 55k but now its pricing is 64k, i suggest wait for sale n grab it.
Thanks a lot.; Don't buy acer laptop very worst company ver very worst,fraud company don't lose ur money to buy not worthy laptops; I have bought this machine A514-54G i5,11th gen in August 2021.
1.Battery life 4 to 5 hours,video quality is good.
2.Sound is good but the volume is not upto the mark.
3.i have got this on Rs.57865,but remember in discription there is Ms office included but the Amazon not provided me.
4.performance of machine is excelent; Top of laptop is of aluminium cover and other is of plastic but should look like a aluminium.
Display Quality is very Good (250nits) even you should work in outdoor places easily..
Battery backup in Normal work is 5 to 6 hrs.
charging cable is quite good not bad .
quality of touch pad is veey smooth like a premium Laptop..

Audio is not so good.. but if you place your laptop on a bed .. in table quality is good
Intel i5 111th gen is fast compared to other like amd and for gaming their is dedicated 2Gb Nvedia MX350 graphic which very good in this price range...; Decent screen quality with good color depth and balance. It gives pretty good battery backup under normal usage. Haven't tested it yet, with running heavy software or gaming.
Quality of speaker is OK, but output is very low even at full volume (my OnePlus gives a better, louder output).
Lookwise, the silver color kinda looks premium but it's all plastic (go for Swift series for a metal body). Build quality could have been better.
Overall a decent purchase for 57k (got some 2k back using cashback offer). Ordered another one for a friend with same offer."

I am a music lover, so I was expecting the sound quality to be better as laptop loaded with 2W speakers.
The battery backup is good.; The Ideapad Slim 5, is a high-quality laptop, perfect for office use. It boasts excellent features, including i5, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. The speed is impressive, making it a strong recommendation for anyone in need of a reliable work companion.; Pros
Good build quality
Anti Glare works fine
Display is good
Charging is fast enough
Keyboard is very good
Backlight keys are well illuminated
Performance is good
Cons
Battery last 3 hrs at 65% brightness
Heating with normal usages
Heating on charging even in switched off
Display brightness is ok but it feels low sometimes.
No RJ45 connector; First of all thanks to Amazon for the fastest deliveries less than 24 hours with good shape.
Now on the laptop front superb finish love at first sight, it is a clean laptop with all the essential features. Top lid is of metal a premium quality laptop with precise cut at each and every corner. It is a 12th Generation i5 - 12450H processor laptop due to which no issues at the processing of task no matter what you give, it run as a breeze, no fingerprint sensor, no graphics card it had a internal graphics card which is terrible if you want this laptop for gaming purpose then do not purchase this. I have purchased this as i have no use of graphics card.

Pros:

ASPECT RATIO: 16:10 ( Major highlight which is helpful in Coding )
SCREEN : IPS Panel with 60Hz resolution with good viewing angle.
CHARGER: 65 Watt Charger with USB type C
FRONT CAM: 720p with privacy shutter.
SSD: 500 GB (with upgradable option)
TRACK PAD : Very nice wide and smooth scroll with good tactile feedback.
BACKLITE KEYBOARD : YES

Cons:

RAM: 16 GB ( not upgradable this is a major downside of this laptop which is so expensive)
HDD: ( no slot for HDD )
FINGERPRINT : NO
GRAPHICS CARD: Inbuilt

HEATING ISSUE:

Most important due to which I gave it a less rating since Lenovo knows it is a H series processor therefore vents should be cut out at the side end of the laptop but at present the vent is at the screen & bottom end due to which when performing high priority tasks it becomes hot as it is clocked at base 2.0 Ghz the keyboard area becomes hot and due to vents placed at screen side screen & metal lid becomes hot not that much hot but still a premium laptop Ideapad 5 series should not have this kind of issues. During benchmark test the keyboard area becomes serious hot and the screen area the right bottom area becomes hot due to vent throwing air at the screen.; Pros:
Look is amazing
16 GB ram is good enough for advanced multitasking
Light weight

Cons:
No FPR; Battery drainage issue üò≠. I have High expectations on this. Literally so frustrated.
When we are on meetings when we turn on camera falsh light automatically turns on and no option to turn it off . So frustrating we can't concentrate on anything else if it keep disturbing our eyes.

I literally don't like that flash when we use camera

Expect these everything is fine; Good product"

smooth and powerful - the 16GB RAM & SSD makes it real fast and responsive; The laptop is great
Latest 13th Gen processor
Display is awesome
Light weight and slim
Battery backup is more than 7 hours; a few times display went into disarray. i was shocked. it hasn't been even a month. I am worried. i dunno if it's a software problem or hardware problem. it became alright after restart. never trust chinese companies; I really liked the product and got it at a very good price INR 43990, after that it went unavailable. I think only few stocks were left as it was a 2023 model. The body, look and feel is similar to mac book, touch pad is very smooth and processing & windows transition speed is really superb and display is really great considering the price. Earlier i was bit hesitant to buy this one, but after buying it have no regret at all. Thanks to Amazon and Seller both for providing me value for money item at a very good price.; Very good product, amazing style slim.; The laptop has a H series CPU. H-series is better than P and far better than U. So, for routine activities, this laptop is more than sufficient. Screen quality, brightness, visibility angle and color reproduction are all great. Wifi and BT works as expected. Audio quality is acceptable. Trackpad is good too. No heating issues. It has nice metal body. This laptop is a good choice for work, education and for general home usage for everyone.

Default setting for keyboard backlight timeout (15s) is annoying. One has to change it in Honor PC Manager. It is possible to play games with the provided Intel graphics, but that's not this laptop is meant for. Included charger's external casing is poorly designed. If there is a switch next to power socket, it will be pushed to ON when you plug in. Charger gets hot sometimes, not worrisome though. When installing your own Windows copy you will need drivers. One needs to go their China website and search based on serial number to get Honor PC manager. It will download all drivers. I wish this gets simpler.

Product support is a big let down. I had a DOA product. Getting a replacement taught me various lessons about this company. If you worry about hardware support, think twice."

1. Powerful processing unit.
2. Runs games and CAD-FEA simulations very easily. Saves you a lot of time in such tasks. Just upgrade the RAM to a higher config(16 doesn‚Äôt seem enough for FEA)
3. Good battery life as per the configuration. I am getting around 6-7 hour of battery life with web browser(firefox) open with keyboard lighting at minimum, and display on 60hz, 25%brightness.
4. Build quality is good as well. But being a macbook user beforehand, I can feel the lack of solidness.
5. Thermals are good. Once you crank up the fans, it run70-80 degrees(while gaming). It does get loud tho, really loud.
6. Display is good, gets bright(enough to be visible in sunlight), great details and 240hz is nice to have with such capable processing units.
7. RGB lighting is really good, +69fps fosure.
8. Speakers are mehh(who uses laptop speaker anyways), webcam is awful.; 1) Beast performance when on latest BIOS version i.e. version 317.

2) Good thermals but ensure you have AC tuned on in room as this is i9 and are designed for countries like USA, Canada and other colder countries as compared to India but they have done great work on thermals.
(Update- AC is required only if you are on Turbo mode. On Performance mode the temps are fine within 80-90 range without AC).; Best; My unit have heavy screen bleeding issues; Superb product."

People were saying that it has battery drain issue, but I found it good. The Battery lasts around 5hrs in normal work including photoshop. The body is strong, design is good. I loved the display.

I was confused between the Infinix one and this one, but this one is much better as Lenovo has broader service area.; I've had it for just over 24 hours now and I've been putting under all kinds of stress tests and benchmarking tests to ensure there is no throttling or defects of any kind - so far everything works as expected. The display is definitely good (better than equivalent ASUS models). Will have to use it for a while to comment about its battery performance. The Lenovo vantage app didn't work at first, but a quick uninstall and reinstall fixed the issue and from there on I was able to fully test all three performance modes. The display has very minor backlight bleed towards the bottom, the rest appears just like regular IPS glow to me. The trackpad is pretty good. As far as games go, I've only tried Rocket League so far. Will update after trying some AAA titles in a week or so.

Update: I've had it for 2 weeks now. Just want to post a quick update. The device has been great so far. It handles anything you throw at it effortlessly plus it stays relatively cool even when put it under stress (games, rendering etc.). I use a basic vertically elevated cooling pad with shitty fans and for me the CPU temps have never gone beyond 87-88 degrees even with air conditioning turned off. On cooler days or with A/C on, the CPU temps (under stress) with cooling pad stay right below 80. Battery backup for normal tasks is 4-6 hours. At this point, the only drawback I feel is the lack of extra USB ports - it has just 2 (might have to use a hub if you've got more USB devices to connect).; So this is my second gaming laptop, first one being the Legion Y520 (i5 7th gen, GTX 1050). That laptop lasted 6 years for me and is currently being used by my sister.

Few reasons why I opted for this laptop in particular:
CPU and GPU combination - Ryzen 7 5800H, RTX 3060 @90W TDP
Display - 165Hz, 100% SRGB
Price: Got it for 89,990

Originally I wanted the MSI Alpha 15 Advantage edition that has the same CPU, but comes with 8GB Radeon 6600M. It was slightly expensive and delivery by Flipkart was quite slow for my address, so I didn't go for it. There were 2 other options from MSI that have RTX 3060 and shipped with i7 CPU, but they did not have color accurate displays (45% color gamut). For these reasons Ideapad gaming 3 became the perfect pick for me and I am impressed with my purchase. Boot times are of course great and games load significantly fast, of course. I am planning to add a 1TB SSD and additional 16GB RAM later which will improve the performance even further!

Following games have been tested by me so far on ultra to medium settings:
World of Warships - average FPS 100-120 @ ultra settings
Witcher 3 - 60 FPS on ultra settings. For some reason the FPS for this game are locked at 60
A Plague Tale: Innocence - 90-120 FPS on medium to ultra settings
Forza Horizon 4 - did not have FPS enable at that time so could not see the actual FPS, but it looked great so I'll assume it was in the range mentioned above

I am planning to try out more games and will update my review accordingly. But so far I am happy with my purchase and can recommend this laptop to future buyers with confidence. Trackpad is quite awesome too, don't know though which driver it is using. Keyboard is great as well, but I use an external keyboard anyway so it does not matter to me. Speakers are satisfactory. They are placed at the bottom and deliver good sound both in terms of quality and loudness.

The device is surprisingly lightweight which is a good thing! Build quality could have been better, but it is definitely not fragile. Keyboard is white backlit only, so no RGB lighting available. I am not into the fancy RGB lighting so it does not bother me at all. I am also thankful that it does not come with red lighting on the keyboard!

Thank you Amazon for quick delivery (16 hours) and thank you Lenovo for this good product.

Edit: I forgot the mention that I played for three hours straight and did not experience any kind of performance throttling. Boot up is almost instant which is expected. Note that it comes with 1x 16GB RAM and my laptop came with WD SN530 SSD. You have one more slot for RAM and SSD each and I've read somewhere that the laptop can support NVMe Gen 4 SSDs, but not sure whether that's true.; All are good; Edit:
DONT BE FOOLED BY 2 RAM SLOTS

IT CAN TAKE A MAX IF 16GB RAM. SO THE ONLY UPGRADE POSSIBLE FOR THE 1x16GB MODEL IS CHANGING IT TO DUAL CHANNEL 2x8GB.

Found out the hard and sad way, also confirmed with Lenovo.

Old:

The other review covers it very well, it will run whatever you throw at it.

I left Red Dead Redemption 2 running for 20 hours straight. resumed playing still ran like butter.

It comes with 2nd NVME slot but no screw so you'll have to procure it separately.

Others count lack of RGB as a con, but I'll say White looks professional, wich goes with the overall look of the laptop, making it suitable for use in professional environments if you don't want everyone around you knowing you're a gamer.

not being able to charge via the USB C is understandable with 170 W in the adaptor.

90W TDP is boost TPG it will show lower but boosts it to 90W. remains cool without throttling even for longer heavy workloads, hint 20hours of RDR2.

I recommend buying a 2nd NVME along with your purchase as you'll run out of 500 gigs quick.

Value for money üí∞.
Thank you amazon üôè; Pro - Well built quality. Nice display. Fast booting. Best laptop in this price range.

Con - No MS Office.; Excellent laptop - have been using it for close to a year now - no issues at all!
smooth and powerful - the 16GB RAM & SSD makes it real fast and responsive; The laptop is great
Latest 13th Gen processor
Display is awesome
Light weight and slim
Battery backup is more than 7 hours; a few times display went into disarray. i was shocked. it hasn't been even a month. I am worried. i dunno if it's a software problem or hardware problem. it became alright after restart. never trust chinese companies; I really liked the product and got it at a very good price INR 43990, after that it went unavailable. I think only few stocks were left as it was a 2023 model. The body, look and feel is similar to mac book, touch pad is very smooth and processing & windows transition speed is really superb and display is really great considering the price. Earlier i was bit hesitant to buy this one, but after buying it have no regret at all. Thanks to Amazon and Seller both for providing me value for money item at a very good price.; Very good product, amazing style slim.; The laptop has a H series CPU. H-series is better than P and far better than U. So, for routine activities, this laptop is more than sufficient. Screen quality, brightness, visibility angle and color reproduction are all great. Wifi and BT works as expected. Audio quality is acceptable. Trackpad is good too. No heating issues. It has nice metal body. This laptop is a good choice for work, education and for general home usage for everyone.

Default setting for keyboard backlight timeout (15s) is annoying. One has to change it in Honor PC Manager. It is possible to play games with the provided Intel graphics, but that's not this laptop is meant for. Included charger's external casing is poorly designed. If there is a switch next to power socket, it will be pushed to ON when you plug in. Charger gets hot sometimes, not worrisome though. When installing your own Windows copy you will need drivers. One needs to go their China website and search based on serial number to get Honor PC manager. It will download all drivers. I wish this gets simpler.

Product support is a big let down. I had a DOA product. Getting a replacement taught me various lessons about this company. If you worry about hardware support, think twice."

The laptop has got great build quality and amazing looks. The gaming performamce is also excellent. But only concern is with the colour accuracy of the display because in Amazon specification section it has been written that it has got 100% srgb but if we type the model no in Lenovo website it shows that this laptop has got only 45% ntsc. Amazon please resolve this issue.; The laptop is just awesome. Although would have preferred Win10 instead of 11, the system is fast and smooth.
I am a pro fortnite player and gaming was awesome on Fortnite, gta5 and wk22.

I must warn that the hot air blow from the 4 vents is too hot. I use it to warm my hands. Gpu runs at around 70 to 80 degrees during gameplay. I got the 3060 version.

Update : The games run smooth only when charger is plugged in, once it goes to battery mode (during power cuts) the FPS drops drastically and the GPU just cant handle the games without stuttering.
Although a laptop, it needs to be plugged in for gaming.

Also, I have a Zebronics UPS (600VA I think), the laptop charger is so bulky that the UPS goes off in 30secs when the laptop charger is on UPS. Good luck during power cuts.

Nonetheless, the laptop is a best buy.; Go for it. Its a beast laptop but I bought it for 1.39lacs but after 7-8 months the price dropped to 1.19lacs now it's 1.04lacs btw I bought this beast in 2022 end september. If you don't need it right now you can wait it'll save you around 35k within 1year and 4 months. In 1.39lacs I can now buy a legion 5pro with 3070 model and save around 10k too.; I don't see any performance issue as it's a beast but camera is worst quality and it stopped working after 2 months of purchase.; Good design & quality but slightly overpriced laptop.; Value for money,best gaming laptop it can run all games up to 60-120 fps ,and display is best unlike other gaming laptop."

1) Performance is Top tier at this price. CPU will be a bottleneck in some cases as its a 13420H but will be fine for most used case scenarios.
2) Battery is OK
3) A little bit of false advertising saying it contains wifi 6E as shown in the attached photo but I checked and it has Wifi 6 Ax203. Most people won't notice the difference though.
4) Display is just ok. Can't complain at this price as all other laptops in this price segment give similar displays. Colors are really unnatural but in Display settings->Advanced Display-> Turn on ""Automatically manage colors for apps"". It will be fine after that.
5) Fans are loud yes but you can actually set custom speeds for fans easily, so I see no issue here. They are generally quiet when not gaming
6) Tried Cyberpunk 2077 at ultra and I must say it was a delight
7) No heating problems
8) Looks are nice, I wanted something which looks simple and basic but packs a punch under its hood, perfect for me
9) Lighter in weight than my previous laptop, no issues for me.
In the end- If performance is your priority, while also looking decent for office or college, it can be a really good choice. I heard i7 variant will launch soon and if that comes under 90k, it will be quite insane.
P.S- One thing I don't like is 512gb ssd only, If they had a option of 1tb at a little premium, it would be perfect. Well, atleast it's Gen 4.; Amazon customer accepted that they have given defective Product and always giving false hope of return and missing their own deadline.
Pathetic customer service. Not even top management acting on this.; ; Pro's :
1. It's value for money ( I am a btech student ) .
2. It's more portable and attractive than I had thought.
3. It's design in very classy ( not gaming one )
4. It is sturdy but not sure about its lifespan .
5. Beautiful keyboard with white backlight numpad and bigger trackpad.
6. No overheating.

Cons :
1. Battery life is awful üòû, sometimes it shows 1.8 hors battery left in 85% battery.
2. Sound quality is good but dts is just on but not making any difference at all, even Equalizer is not working , it looks like a gimmick.

Overall display is average and manageable , it does not let it down ,

But , if you want better build with 90 whrs battery life , Dolby audio , mux switch, etc and especially gaming looks , go for Asus tuf 15 i5 12500h rtx 3050

And if you want a professional looking laptop with better internal specs and don't do gaming that much like me ( use for btech ) , you should go for it.; Awesome product, good performance and worth buying it.good build quality,
Good battery life and camera is also better,
Value for money.; This is a great budget laptop. I managed to get it for just under 71k during the Diwali sale. In my opinion, this device offers the best specs for its price range in the current market. There aren't many laptops in this price range that offer an RTX 4050. So, without any hesitation, I would recommend going for it. The performance is excellent; you can run every AAA title on very high to maximum settings. Even some unoptimized games will run smoothly. The display is decent, and the battery backup is satisfactory, although gaming is recommended while plugged in for maximum performance. One minor issue I found was the placement of the heat sink, right above the keyboard, which heats up a lot after a gaming session of 2-3 hours. But I believe it's manageable; after all, which gaming laptop doesn't heat up? Overall, apart from 1-2 compromises, this laptop is a beast at this price point.; Purchased it for Graphics intensive work like CAD and Designing. Works well."

A good sturdy laptop that handles all major tasks with ease (had 30+ tabs open across multiple browsers, using Figma, while also installing some software and running zoom in the background. Handled it all like a beast.

However, the battery life doesn't last as long as promised. Reviews said it lasts around 8 hours, for me, it's just about 3-4 hours before it goes down to 30% and I plug in.; u can bost the sound through setting and ryzen 7 is powerful enough and 5800hs processor is good and GAMING is 10/6 sounds 10/8 display quality 10/10 you can buy it. I brought it 56,000. Thousand; This product is absolutely amazing. Value for money!.; This is serious review, I bought this laptop 4 months ago for Coding purposes.
After a month I noticed it turned off suddenly, while finding the reason I got to know that it reached max temprature (due to windows uldate installation) so that got off while I was working. Thought if I change it's fan profile to gaming mode (that may increase fan noise) it will handle the windows updates next time.
But today while working it got the same issue 2 times. I suggest not to buy this (especially amd - asus).
PLEASE DON'T BUY; Good for Video & Photo Editing, Coding and other creative stuff. I had great gaming experience in it too. It could be more better if they've provided Windows 11 pro in the box instead of home edition but that is option.

Overall liked it.; ; Absolutely love this product! It exceeded my expectations in every way. The quality is top-notch, it's incredibly durable, and the functionality is outstanding.

Quality of the product is also really great, it will be slightly on the heavier side but its a gaming laptop so no issues. Appearance is classy and RGB lighting is rare in this price.
Display is just like any other display in this price range. It can play 4k videos on YouTube so no issues.
Only downside of this laptop at this moment for me is its battery, with i gpu only mode and performance mode turned on, backlight turned off and brightness set to 50 percentage the battery will last for 3 to 5 hours according to you, but remember this is a windows gaming laptop with 85 w tgp rtx 3050 so the battery backup is not bad.Also you will only use a gaming laptop by plugging in.

I bought it for 62990.
But in summer sale it is for as low as 55400.
Pros: Antiglare Display and Performance this combination of CPU and GPU can only be seen in 80-90k laptops.
Note: battery lasts for around 2-3 hours in Normal use and 1 hour while gaming. See it's already insisted to use laptop plugged in while gaming, so don't mind battery, since it has 4 cooling fans and they require power.; I bought this laptop for 57k after Bank Discount and this Laptop Is Amazing. Its display is also nice and giving a good quality Go for It i you are looking for a laptop in this range its value for money sound Quality is good but i would prefer using headphones while gaming on it and the batter is also good i have been playing gta v for straight 4 hours on it and it didn't even lag a bit Its Amazing laptop; bought it at 57k , honestly its a goddam steal; ; "

If you are not that tech savvy and need a daily driver, its better to pay a bit more and get the laptop with preinstalled windows and MS office.
For tinkerers or someone who wants to run linux (I used linux mint), this works well. Use a USB stick, install your OS (if you want to dualboot, install windows first, then your other OS), and get your drivers.
However keep in mind, there is no internet drivers in the laptop (both wifi and ethernet), so you will have issues installing windows 11 unless you install drivers using CMD or use a USB wifi dongle. So its better to install windows 10, and then update to 11 for ease of use.

Although yes, one con is that speakers aren't the loudest so it's best used with headphones or external speakers.; Although it's smooth but the applications lag at some times. Let's see for the future.; I ordered this yesterday (June 5th, 2024) and received it today (June 6th, 2024). First I noticed the lenovo package seal was cut halfway, I thought it could be torn by poor package handling and the laptop should be okay. The laptop was actually ok but when i checked on Lenovo's warranty site, I got to know it was activated already on 29th March 2024.. May be it was a used one and I lost two months of warranty.. Worst experience with amazon cc today for a simple solution they made me wait and bounced me like a ping pong ball for more than 3 hours to different representatives and unclear and worst explanation. Finally they have initiated an investigation about why some white sticker where on all the bar codes around the box and about the warranty too and asked me to wait till june 10th ... I sometimes have bad time with Appario retail but Amazon is quick to take return of products from non amazon sellers and not for Appario.. Why?; Pros:
Build Quality
Screen 300 nits brightness
2 RAM DDR5 Slots
2 M.2 gen4 slots
Latest wifi6
Light weight
Fingerprint
Camera with Shutter Privacy

Best option for business use, study, mid level video editing
Battery üîã life nice ... getting about 6+ hours on video over the wifi

Cons:
Not Evo rated
Keyboard back-lit

Note: laptop will comes with great upgradibilty options. It's make it future proof.

Few customer may be finding an issue of warranty.
Dates are not correct.

Need to login to your lenovo account and fill the form to register and this will fix the issue.

You just need to change the date of purchase.; Installed windows 11, ethernet / wifi drives installed via USB , added 16GB RAM (you can add single 32GB stick) to free slot and total RAM is 24GB now and will add nvme to empty slot if needed in future

- Windows 11 professional- 600Rs from Amazon reseller
- 16GB ram for 3k
- mcafee antivirus rs500 from Amazon reseller; I am happy with the laptop, since you get what you paid for.
Expect these in this laptop:
1. No Kayboard light
2. Though it says that the display is HD, but the display is not upto the mark. Colour looks different when you change the viewing angle.
3. Sound quality is quite good
4. Battery life is moderate. My other i5 thinkpad lasts longer with similar usage. Charges pretty fast with its 65watt charger
5. It is slightly heavy due to it's metal body; I liked the anti glare screen quality of the laptop. Lenovo has a very good laptop üíªüëç; Very good product if it's fits in your budget must go for it"

I had also contacted lenovo support team and they told me that this model releases with trial version of windows only.

This was the only one available with SATA port and reasonably recent CPU and a reasonable price. On that front, it is great.

However, I wanted to use it with Linux, and on that front I took a huge risk. Luckily, almost everything works fine on Linux. However, suspend to RAM doesn't work. To go into details, the BIOS doesn't support S3 sleep. It only supports S0x sleep, support for which is only beginning to mature in Linux. I am currently forced to use hibernate, which is slower.; Worst display quality , sound quality is also not good , customer care don't pick up the call , customer care don't response on return policy , not value for money; Superior look and light weight
AMD is always better than Intel in overall performance; I bought this laptop about 10 months ago,I have to say the laptop performance is good,great upgrade options, but have note that acer service quality is poor I live in Pune and the have only on service center,no pickup available, I didn't like the customer care as they didn't provide me with the solution,I am disappointed üòû with the brand after sale service . Literally pathatic.; It's not bad, but not good either. I bought it for 38,990. I was getting the same price for some other acer laptop with intel i5 1155g7 processor and IPS display, but I missed the deal. So, I bought this ‚òπÔ∏è.

Pros:
1- Performance is not an issue. Decent performance for most of the tasks.
2- Didn't do gaming, so not sure of that. But for programming, it's good.
3- Good for multitasking.
4- Audio is good. It's not loud, but sufficient and it comes with Nahimic audio (for which you will have to download it's app) which enhances it's audio capabilities. Audio can be optimised for different purpose.
5- Sufficient ports. Also have type C port.
6- It has control center to control fan speed, external keyboard light, manage fan speed, power.
7- Battery is decent and can last 4-5 hours on regular workload. But on heavy workload, it will last around 2-2.5 hours.
8- Lookwise it is good.
9- lifetime windows 11 home.

Cons:
1- Although display is antiglare FHD. It's not IPS, so it looks crisp but average. It's just ok for the purpose of coding or regular tasks where we just want the work to be done. Since viewing angle are bad, so for entertainment, it's good for single person for watching movies but not for multiple people. Display is not good for graphic designer who needs color accuracy.
2- There is no backlit keyboard. So, if you want backlit, connect external keyboard with backlit.
3- Although it has an SSD, I didn't find the boot time to be faster. It is fast but didn't meet my expectations.
4- Graphic card is not dedicated which is just good for normal work. I don't think you will enjoy gaming on it. It can play light games but surely you won't enjoy gaming on such system. And it won't able to play high demanding games.
5- Doesn't have activated ms office. You will have to buy it's keys.

Note:
You can install a separate harddisk (HDD) for storing data. Screws are provided with laptop.

For me, the bottom side became very hot and fans started making noise, when it first arrived and I was installing windows updates on it first used it on my bed, that is without proper ventilation. But with proper air flow, it doesn't heat.

Conclusion:
If you are limited on budget and only want your work to be done and doesn't care much about display quality or back lit keyboard or you aren't a gamer, you can buy it.
And if you already bought it, don't regret your decision. It's a ok laptop for most of the task and will get your work done.

UPDATE:- It hangs in middle, and everything stops working not even power button unless I press it for long time to force shutdown.....all my work was lost and mind you I was not doing a heavy task that it couldn't handle, simple web browsing and it stopped in middle, nothing worked....really frustrated..... Don't know if it was windows 11 issue or due to cheap hardware of this machine,ü•πüò°; nice laptop for the price paid...got good exchange price also for old laptop.."

Never buy this product because you are going to regret later. Advice from my side brothers and sisters; **5 out of 5 stars - Beastly Performer for Gaming and Creation Alike!**

I recently purchased the ASUS Gaming Laptop with an Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM, and the NVIDIA RTX 4060, and it's been nothing but a delight. This machine crushes every game I throw at it with ultra settings while maintaining buttery smooth frame rates. The RTX 4060 GPU is a perfect sweet spot for gaming and content creation, delivering stellar performance without breaking the bank.

The 16GB of RAM is ample for multitasking, allowing me to keep multiple programs open without any lag. Editing videos has been a breeze, and this laptop chews through rendering tasks with surprising swiftness, thanks to the potent combination of the i7 processor and dedicated graphics.

The design is sleek, with a robust build quality that feels sturdy, yet it's not too heavy to carry around. The cooling system is top-notch, keeping the system cool even under heavy loads while maintaining noise levels that don't sound like a jet engine.

Now, it has come to my attention that some users have given this laptop less-than-favorable reviews, and I think it's important to address these. The most common points of contention seem to be as follows:

1. **Price**: Some believe the price is steep. However, considering the hardware packed into this machine, it is quite competitive. You really get what you pay for.

2. **Battery Life**: For a gaming laptop with this caliber of hardware, battery life is always a challenge. It seems some users expected more, but in my experience, the battery serves well for a gaming-focused device.

3. **Noise**: When pushed to its limits, the fans can get loud. Some users find this off-putting, but it's a small trade-off for keeping the system cool during intense gaming sessions.

In conclusion, the negative reviews often stem from expectations that may not align with the reality of high-performance gaming laptops. When purchasing this ASUS model, you're getting a premium device tailored for gaming and content creation‚Äîa fact that should set expectations for aspects like price, battery life, and fan noise. For those looking for a reliable, high-spec machine that delivers both in-game and during CPU/GPU-intensive tasks, this ASUS laptop is an excellent choice.

*Disclaimer: This review is based on personal usage and experience. Individual experiences may vary.*; All in all a nice packed laptop with value for money, I ran almost all latest games like Forza 5, CoD and others, it handles all of them at ease; This one is light and have high performance for a light weight laptop but when you consider it's gpu it will definetely dissapoint you as this one scoring a little worse than fully powered rtx 4050
If only asus used DDR5 ram and increased the max total tgp to 90w it would have performed much better
If anyone want a light weight laptop for battery then this is a no go as it has 12th gen intel which is not very power effiecient resulting in 4-5 hrs max battery only in normal usage.
Why would anybody sacrifice so much for just full metal build which is a boon and bane both at the same time
Asus in its premium vivobook pro oled used the same specs but that laptop has total tgp of 150w which makes that a killer light weight laptop but thats overpriced; "

1) Performance is Top tier at this price. CPU will be a bottleneck in some cases as its a 13420H but will be fine for most used case scenarios.
2) Battery is OK
3) A little bit of false advertising saying it contains wifi 6E as shown in the attached photo but I checked and it has Wifi 6 Ax203. Most people won't notice the difference though.
4) Display is just ok. Can't complain at this price as all other laptops in this price segment give similar displays. Colors are really unnatural but in Display settings->Advanced Display-> Turn on ""Automatically manage colors for apps"". It will be fine after that.
5) Fans are loud yes but you can actually set custom speeds for fans easily, so I see no issue here. They are generally quiet when not gaming
6) Tried Cyberpunk 2077 at ultra and I must say it was a delight
7) No heating problems
8) Looks are nice, I wanted something which looks simple and basic but packs a punch under its hood, perfect for me
9) Lighter in weight than my previous laptop, no issues for me.
In the end- If performance is your priority, while also looking decent for office or college, it can be a really good choice. I heard i7 variant will launch soon and if that comes under 90k, it will be quite insane.
P.S- One thing I don't like is 512gb ssd only, If they had a option of 1tb at a little premium, it would be perfect. Well, atleast it's Gen 4.; Amazon customer accepted that they have given defective Product and always giving false hope of return and missing their own deadline.
Pathetic customer service. Not even top management acting on this.; ; Pro's :
1. It's value for money ( I am a btech student ) .
2. It's more portable and attractive than I had thought.
3. It's design in very classy ( not gaming one )
4. It is sturdy but not sure about its lifespan .
5. Beautiful keyboard with white backlight numpad and bigger trackpad.
6. No overheating.

Cons :
1. Battery life is awful üòû, sometimes it shows 1.8 hors battery left in 85% battery.
2. Sound quality is good but dts is just on but not making any difference at all, even Equalizer is not working , it looks like a gimmick.

Overall display is average and manageable , it does not let it down ,

But , if you want better build with 90 whrs battery life , Dolby audio , mux switch, etc and especially gaming looks , go for Asus tuf 15 i5 12500h rtx 3050

And if you want a professional looking laptop with better internal specs and don't do gaming that much like me ( use for btech ) , you should go for it.; Awesome product, good performance and worth buying it.good build quality,
Good battery life and camera is also better,
Value for money.; This is a great budget laptop. I managed to get it for just under 71k during the Diwali sale. In my opinion, this device offers the best specs for its price range in the current market. There aren't many laptops in this price range that offer an RTX 4050. So, without any hesitation, I would recommend going for it. The performance is excellent; you can run every AAA title on very high to maximum settings. Even some unoptimized games will run smoothly. The display is decent, and the battery backup is satisfactory, although gaming is recommended while plugged in for maximum performance. One minor issue I found was the placement of the heat sink, right above the keyboard, which heats up a lot after a gaming session of 2-3 hours. But I believe it's manageable; after all, which gaming laptop doesn't heat up? Overall, apart from 1-2 compromises, this laptop is a beast at this price point.; Purchased it for Graphics intensive work like CAD and Designing. Works well."

If you are not that tech savvy and need a daily driver, its better to pay a bit more and get the laptop with preinstalled windows and MS office.
For tinkerers or someone who wants to run linux (I used linux mint), this works well. Use a USB stick, install your OS (if you want to dualboot, install windows first, then your other OS), and get your drivers.
However keep in mind, there is no internet drivers in the laptop (both wifi and ethernet), so you will have issues installing windows 11 unless you install drivers using CMD or use a USB wifi dongle. So its better to install windows 10, and then update to 11 for ease of use.

Although yes, one con is that speakers aren't the loudest so it's best used with headphones or external speakers.; Although it's smooth but the applications lag at some times. Let's see for the future.; I ordered this yesterday (June 5th, 2024) and received it today (June 6th, 2024). First I noticed the lenovo package seal was cut halfway, I thought it could be torn by poor package handling and the laptop should be okay. The laptop was actually ok but when i checked on Lenovo's warranty site, I got to know it was activated already on 29th March 2024.. May be it was a used one and I lost two months of warranty.. Worst experience with amazon cc today for a simple solution they made me wait and bounced me like a ping pong ball for more than 3 hours to different representatives and unclear and worst explanation. Finally they have initiated an investigation about why some white sticker where on all the bar codes around the box and about the warranty too and asked me to wait till june 10th ... I sometimes have bad time with Appario retail but Amazon is quick to take return of products from non amazon sellers and not for Appario.. Why?; Pros:
Build Quality
Screen 300 nits brightness
2 RAM DDR5 Slots
2 M.2 gen4 slots
Latest wifi6
Light weight
Fingerprint
Camera with Shutter Privacy

Best option for business use, study, mid level video editing
Battery üîã life nice ... getting about 6+ hours on video over the wifi

Cons:
Not Evo rated
Keyboard back-lit

Note: laptop will comes with great upgradibilty options. It's make it future proof.

Few customer may be finding an issue of warranty.
Dates are not correct.

Need to login to your lenovo account and fill the form to register and this will fix the issue.

You just need to change the date of purchase.; Installed windows 11, ethernet / wifi drives installed via USB , added 16GB RAM (you can add single 32GB stick) to free slot and total RAM is 24GB now and will add nvme to empty slot if needed in future

- Windows 11 professional- 600Rs from Amazon reseller
- 16GB ram for 3k
- mcafee antivirus rs500 from Amazon reseller; I am happy with the laptop, since you get what you paid for.
Expect these in this laptop:
1. No Kayboard light
2. Though it says that the display is HD, but the display is not upto the mark. Colour looks different when you change the viewing angle.
3. Sound quality is quite good
4. Battery life is moderate. My other i5 thinkpad lasts longer with similar usage. Charges pretty fast with its 65watt charger
5. It is slightly heavy due to it's metal body; I liked the anti glare screen quality of the laptop. Lenovo has a very good laptop üíªüëç; Very good product if it's fits in your budget must go for it"

However, I wanted to use it with Linux, and on that front I took a huge risk. Luckily, almost everything works fine on Linux. However, suspend to RAM doesn't work. To go into details, the BIOS doesn't support S3 sleep. It only supports S0x sleep, support for which is only beginning to mature in Linux. I am currently forced to use hibernate, which is slower.; Worst display quality , sound quality is also not good , customer care don't pick up the call , customer care don't response on return policy , not value for money; Superior look and light weight
AMD is always better than Intel in overall performance; I bought this laptop about 10 months ago,I have to say the laptop performance is good,great upgrade options, but have note that acer service quality is poor I live in Pune and the have only on service center,no pickup available, I didn't like the customer care as they didn't provide me with the solution,I am disappointed üòû with the brand after sale service . Literally pathatic.; It's not bad, but not good either. I bought it for 38,990. I was getting the same price for some other acer laptop with intel i5 1155g7 processor and IPS display, but I missed the deal. So, I bought this ‚òπÔ∏è.

Pros:
1- Performance is not an issue. Decent performance for most of the tasks.
2- Didn't do gaming, so not sure of that. But for programming, it's good.
3- Good for multitasking.
4- Audio is good. It's not loud, but sufficient and it comes with Nahimic audio (for which you will have to download it's app) which enhances it's audio capabilities. Audio can be optimised for different purpose.
5- Sufficient ports. Also have type C port.
6- It has control center to control fan speed, external keyboard light, manage fan speed, power.
7- Battery is decent and can last 4-5 hours on regular workload. But on heavy workload, it will last around 2-2.5 hours.
8- Lookwise it is good.
9- lifetime windows 11 home.

Cons:
1- Although display is antiglare FHD. It's not IPS, so it looks crisp but average. It's just ok for the purpose of coding or regular tasks where we just want the work to be done. Since viewing angle are bad, so for entertainment, it's good for single person for watching movies but not for multiple people. Display is not good for graphic designer who needs color accuracy.
2- There is no backlit keyboard. So, if you want backlit, connect external keyboard with backlit.
3- Although it has an SSD, I didn't find the boot time to be faster. It is fast but didn't meet my expectations.
4- Graphic card is not dedicated which is just good for normal work. I don't think you will enjoy gaming on it. It can play light games but surely you won't enjoy gaming on such system. And it won't able to play high demanding games.
5- Doesn't have activated ms office. You will have to buy it's keys.

Note:
You can install a separate harddisk (HDD) for storing data. Screws are provided with laptop.

For me, the bottom side became very hot and fans started making noise, when it first arrived and I was installing windows updates on it first used it on my bed, that is without proper ventilation. But with proper air flow, it doesn't heat.

Conclusion:
If you are limited on budget and only want your work to be done and doesn't care much about display quality or back lit keyboard or you aren't a gamer, you can buy it.
And if you already bought it, don't regret your decision. It's a ok laptop for most of the task and will get your work done.

UPDATE:- It hangs in middle, and everything stops working not even power button unless I press it for long time to force shutdown.....all my work was lost and mind you I was not doing a heavy task that it couldn't handle, simple web browsing and it stopped in middle, nothing worked....really frustrated..... Don't know if it was windows 11 issue or due to cheap hardware of this machine,ü•πüò°; nice laptop for the price paid...got good exchange price also for old laptop.."

- Great build quality (Metal alloy body)
- Good processor (i5 11th gen)

Great for students and working professionals with normal to medium level usage.
All in all it's a great product!; I had received the product on 5 Oct and found that power button not working on same day. Amazon promised inspection by agent in 48 hours, but the inspection happened only on 11 Oct that is 6 days. After the service engineer verified that the system is faulty, Amazon said they are to arrange a pick up in next 48 hours, that is by 13th. Today is 18th end of day, nobody has picked up despite repeated intimation. Now, I can't talk to Amazon helpline also, presumably they have blocked my number (?). So now I am stuck with a defective product, money held up with hostile Amazon. BTW, most service agents who attend calls in the day time are rude as well. I suppose the combination of this vendor and Amazon does not work well.; Laptop is not upto my expectations with display, sound and usability.; It's working good. Looks cool and functioning well üíØ. Good one. But i feel like battery life is somewhat a issue; This is a good product for my requirement. I do a music production and a little bit of coding.

- Amazing performance better than any laptops under 90k budget
- RTX 3060 just run all AAA games buttery smooth

Cons
- Below average speakers but if tuned using DTS X can be much better
- Got it without documents and back panel worn out but considering 2 year online warranty pretty much okay with it.
- Battery will last less than an hour on heavy games and while in power saving mode, will last 3+ hours of normal surfing and other activities

Final verdict if you are looking for a performance oriented laptop and if this is available under 90k, its a no brainer - GO FOR IT!!!!; The laptop is a beast performance wise
The fans are a bit noisy
Battery life is merely 2.5hrs max
But the performance is all bang for the buck
The build is sturdy too

Just got the laptop without documents and backpanel graphics
But considering i got it for 80k and 2 years warrenty I'm fine with it"

With its Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD, it offers smooth performance for day-to-day tasks like web browsing, office work, and even some lightweight photo and video editing.

I was pleased by how lightweight and slim the aluminum alloy body feels. The CoreBook is easy to carry around the house or toss in a bag to take on the go. The narrow bezels surrounding the 14.1-inch 1080p screen give it a modern look and allow for a compact footprint overall.

The backlit keyboard feels snappy and responsive when typing. I was able to type quickly and accurately thanks to the well-spaced layout. The large clickable trackpad is also accurate and smooth. Battery life is fairly strong as well. I got close to 8 hours of mixed usage on a single charge consisting of web browsing, streaming video, and document editing. This should get most users through a full work or school day without issue.

Considering its combination of performance hardware, premium metal body, backlit keyboard, and competitive battery life, the asking price of around 24000/- INR feels like an incredible value. For budget-minded buyers who still want power and build quality, the Chuwi CoreBook is easy to recommend. It punches well above its class and serves as a capable daily driver laptop for work, school, and general use.; Con... - Kabhi Kabhi touch pad Kam Nahi Kar Raha hai,scrin bliding problem hai,3 speaker hai right side se jyada awaj a Raha hai left side Ka spiker kafi jyada slow hai , Display ko fold kar√±e par display bliding jyada ho Raha hai, displa flex ho Raha hai ,pixal press ho raha hai, software ko hardware ke sath Acha se optimise Nahi Kiya Gaya hai,Kabhi Kabhi software Acha se Kam Nahi Kar Raha hai,touch and ky BHI Kam Nahi Kar Raha hai,restart kar√±e par thik ho Raha hai .

Price- 21000/; Configuration is just AWESOME and the laptop too. I have placed order during one day Festival Day offer. Got excellent Discount up to 5k. Unfortunately, laptop is not getting switched on after use for 10-20min. I thought its due to no charge, tried to switch ON using both charger and C type, but no. Otherwise, design of the laptop, performance, look, color, all very very good. When I spoke to customer support I have not got Replacement option due to no stock.; This thin, affordable laptop is a gem. Its portability is unmatched, making it perfect for on-the-go tasks. The trackpad is responsive, ensuring seamless navigation. With Windows 11, the user experience is top-notch. The 512GB SSD and 8GB RAM provide ample storage and smooth multitasking. It's a steal for the price, striking a balance between affordability and performance. Ideal for work and daily use, this laptop proves you don't need to break the bank for quality. If you crave a budget-friendly, portable powerhouse, this is your go-to device.; 1stly - the price. Got it on sale for ‚Çπ21k, and as someone who works in the dark all the time, finding a laptop at this price that has a Backlit Keyboard is a dream come true.

2ndly - Keyboard and mouse trackpad. Keyboard is backlit and has two brightness levels when on - medium and high. Medium is good enough, high might eat more battery. Just an observation, the backlight will be off everytime you boot up, regardless of what it was set to before. Key press virtually soundless, and feel soft; very similar to dell keyboards. Mouse trackpad is as smooth as Macbooks. Gestures all work nicely, and multi-finger scrolls and swipes are all silky smooth.

3rdly - Battery life. Been getting almost 3 to 4 hours on full charge with mostly for work - Excel, 4 to 5 Chrome tabs, and a couple background apps running.

4thly - Upgradable RAM. YES! It's motherboard comes with unremovable 8gb RAM, and an empty DDR4 SO-DIMM Laptop RAM slot. 8+8gb is more than enough to turn this into a mini performance beast with absolutely no lag at all with the included Windows 11 OS. Just make sure to double check the built-in 8gb RAM's MHz speed and match it accordingly. In my case, I went with G.Skill's 3200MHz CL-22 8GB SO-DIMM Laptop RAM stick.

5thly - Windows 11. Microsoft has finally nailed it with their OS. This is coming from someone who absolutely abhorred Win10 so much, and shifted to MacOS in 2015, and now switching back to Win11. Needed a quick and budget laptop 'cause my 13"" rMacbook Pro's screen fully cracked, and I must say, I was pleasantly pleased with how buttery smooth everything is, similar to MacOS if not better. Actually, it is better, given all the extra things Windows could always let you do, but now with all that extra smoothness. Took me about 15 minutes, to set everything up, and get it looking as close as possible to classic Windows UI (harken back to them peaceful XP days).

6thly - Build quality is great. Feels and looks premium. Very mild wobbling, but the hinges feel stable and sturdy. Underside has one long vent for airflow and two speaker vents. Laptop isn't rated for any kind of water protection, but I must mention that it ended up getting quite wet, if not soaked in the December 2023 Chennai floods. The laptop was in my messenger bag and the bag fell completely submerged in water. Didn't switch it on for 2 weeks, removed the battery and kept it in a bucket of dry rice(yes that old ""hack"") along with the charger as well, gently wiped off any visible wetness on the momboard, closed up and dried the machine in the sun a few hours everyday, put it all back together after 2 weeks, booted up with much suspense, and it all works as usual despite everyone(online and support) saying otherwise. Altho there were visible water spots under the screen, after almost 2 months now it has dried and reduced 95% on its own.

7thly - Performance. Now, don't go expecting to use this for high end gaming, get a console for that. For minimal, and light gaming it works great. Installed Need For Speed Most Wanted 2005 and just completed it again after many years. Worked flawlessly on max graphics settings - was getting 60fps with slight dips in framerate when the screen gets a little busy.

Lastly - Service & Support. The Chuwi support was quite responsive through WhatsApp. Upon first boot, it showed Win11 wasn't activated and panic started kicking in. Before I kicked myself any further, tried reaching out to Chuwi support. They wanted to send a technician over to activate it which would've taken a day or two - my impatience meant I couldn't and wouldn't wait at all. Took a bit of back and forth messaging on WhatsApp, but they eventually sent over the Product Key to activate Windows, and I easily did it myself pretty quick. In the case of local servicing, they have designated technicians in each city with whom they've tied up with to provide service.; ; When I got the book, I was surprised by the IPS screen. I never saw suck a 2K beautiful screen at this price level. Neither HP, Dell, nor Lenovo can provide suck an excellent screen. It is very comfortable to read the news or watch videos on it even under sunlight in the afternoon.
The CPU is as same as the one used in the old MacBook (2018), but it can provide enough power for daily use as an Ultrabook. I did not see any lag when I use it for internet surfing and office work.
8 GB memory is also good enough for office work. But sometimes when I run large data set for analysis, I can feel a bit of RAM shortage. But thanks to the high-speed SSD drive, the virtual memory helps a lot. And there are two RAM slots in the motherboard. It will help the ram expansion if it is necessary for the future.
The SSD hard drive is 512GB. Its capacity is twice times bigger than other laptops at this price level. There is enough space for me.
The keyboard is also excellent. I almost have the same feeling on it as on my old MacBook. The keys can light up in the dark. I love this keyboard after one month of typing on it.
Here is what I like
1. Excellent screen and keyboard,
2. Fast and large SSD drive,
3. Lightweight.
What I do not like
1. Not PD charging.
2. Only 5-6 hours battery power.
3. Not for gaming, not for large data analysis.; I got this laptop as a gift for my dad to replace his 7yr old Lenovo. I was a bit wary at first of this brand, but I was willing to try it, as the main brands were selling new laptops with old components at a high price due to the supply shortage.

This laptop is great for just slipping in your bag and heading out. It‚Äôs very thin, super lightweight, and has a pretty sturdy metal construction.

I got it primarily for running Inkscape, but it may do a bit of light gaming at low settings.

I love the 3:2 aspect ratio, and the 2K resolution really pops out. It also is able to display more on the smaller screen due to the higher pixel density.

Speaking of the small screen, the 14‚Äù (I think it‚Äôs closer to 13.6‚Äù) panel is a bit of a downgrade if you‚Äôre used to bigger screens. If you‚Äôre looking for a 15‚Äù or above, this isn‚Äôt the laptop for you.

One downside of such a thin laptop is a lack of I/O ports. It has one USB-A 3 port and a 3.5mm headset jack on the right side, and one USB-C port on the left. The charging port is also on the left side, and this laptop does not support USB-C power delivery.

If you want to output to an external display or connect more than one flash drive, you‚Äôll need a USB-C dock. But these minor problems are to be expected with such a thin laptop.

Now, it may just be me, but I thought the keyboard felt very cheap. It had a bit of play around each key, and I did not enjoy the typing experience. I think it may have been the switched the manufacturer used in the laptop, but I figured it was acceptable in a non-mainstream laptop.

I noticed that the metal skin of the laptop picked up smudges and fingerprints rather easily. Not a dealbreaker for me.

If you are looking for an aggressively decent laptop that looks a bit like a MacBook Air, this is the one for you.; I was very surprised by the value of this laptop in this price range. I bought it to see if it was as good as other reviews said it was. I had in mind to try it and return it if necessary. After a few days of use, I knew I was definitely keeping it. I was amazed at the great screen resolution. The audio is surprisingly very good. Very happy with the battery life and speed of the processor. It's light and sleek. The only thing that concerned me initially, is having only 1 USB port. So far no problem. I'll just get an adapter if needed. I Never heard of this brand, but this is truly a great buy on a laptop.; Cheap metal, 1 mega pixel front camera, 1 single usb port, no HDMI slot, no SD card slot, buggy touchpad, 1.5 hr max battery life, overheats easily, not for light gaming. But worst of all 2 months after use it starts making a high pitch when running, making it impossible to keep using it without getting a headache. Seller would not reimburse or accept return. Buy name brands dont waste your money on this.; Most of the time that I am about to buy something from a brand that I don't know, I get very suspicious. This computer has been one of the best purchases I have ever done here on amazon. The computer is fast, and the screen is very bright. It is also very light and perfect for me to take to school. I would say that this computer maybe can run some games, but not the high-end ones because you will need a better GPU. I don't think you will find a better deal than this computer."

since i had a workstation already i did not wanted to buy a gaming laptop. [owned one in past]
gaming laptops are heavvy and feels hot. you cannot use those anywhere like this slim ultrabook.

I bougth this laptop because its very thin and light. can work with it anywhere on bed, sofa, car, restaurant anywhere. very easy to carry. only have essential hardware in it. i did not wanted a gpu since i dont play game on laptop. [gaming rigs are best only]

this laptop is also very quick than normal laptops in booting and shutting down time. very easy to use like opening flap and scrolling with touchscreen when reading something. also get charged quickly.

for hacking and bug bounty usage its a beast of a machine since i have to run alot of diffrent browser tabs open along with other tools like burpsuit and virtulbox. it handles everything without issues.

if you enable high performance mode it will nevel make you feel anything less than a i9.

the sound is also great. i have watched youtube and many people said it has bad speakers or not impressive sound. i also believed that when i played some songs.
but later i have found the dolby atmos setting and when i enabled it the sound feels amazing and ittle loud than before.

about battery life i dont use it on battery much but it can run for 4 5 hours according to your usage.

keybaord is normal nothing specail [i prefer machanical only]

mouse is great [ prefer external mouse]

touchscreen is incredble and its display is very beautiful like it will smoke any high end display in quality.

not a gaming laptop but i have tried valorant on this and it was on 100+fps.

i dont do editing so i am not going to talk about it.[ prefer my rig for gpu intense things]

i have s22 ultra so its very nice to use it with this laptop to transfer files and data faster and without any wire.

the only issue i have faced is when 50+ tab open firefox+chrome+ brave and virtual box running linux when i started obs to record some screen recording it lagged a bit 2 3 times for 2 3 seconds.
but when i enabled high performance mode from samsung settings it was gone and never saw that again.

installing letest updates about you drivers is easy samsung tell when asap when its available to install.

overall i never found any flaw in this laptop. the opening and closing of apps is very smooth.

like if you start your laptop and instantly unlcok it and open multiple apps like chrome and other it will not lag or it will not take time, you will see smooth one click operations.

Update: Selling this for upcoming pc from samsung.

If you feel any lag You can tweak this laptop:

Download winpilot from github and remove unnecessary bloatwares from samsung and microsoft.

Set your display to 120hz always.

Enable dolby atmos for speakers.; üòç Loved the 2X Dynamic 3K Amoled Display with 16:10 ratio
Boom AKG's quad speakers with Dolby Atmos at its best
S pen üíØ
Oversized touch pad looks bit odd
Intel Evo i7 1360P üî•; Build quality, screen size, weight and specifications are great for those looking to breakaway from Apple ecosystem.

Created and rendered many videos using Davinci Resolve, in a breeze. Browsing and data processing is very zippy with 16b RAM.

Plenty of disk space is a good luxury to have especially since Cloud subscriptions are expensive. Go for 1 Tb version.

Flip standing mode allows me to watch youtube content or movies while at the dining table.

Kid loves to sketch using digital pen on such a huge surface.

After discounts online price in India comes lower than what it is in the USA (inclusive of taxes).

A few not so great things to watch -

Very glossy screen causes a lot of reflection in a very brightly lit room.

Video editing and rendering drains battery very quickly and also heats up the machine.

Occasionally, i am reminded of why i moved away from Windows OS in the first place (for over 15 years). I do get some application errors which requires reboot or reinstall of dlls etc. But these are more to do with Windows and less to do with Samsung.

Overall -with Galaxy Book3 series, Samsung has nailed it just like how it has held its ground solidly with smartphones.; It started trouble with wifi and Bluetooth since beginning. As usual I tried reinstalling driver and it work. The frequency of issue increased and it stopped completely and samsung is not able to repair since a month almost. All their commitment failed so far.; After eternally using trusted warhorses like Dell and HP, I shifted to Samsung purely based on my experience with Samsung Galaxy ZFold3, a truly grand and ground-breaking phone in my opinion. Taking a laptop decision based on a smartphone experience is definitely bizarre, but then, I am so glad I did it. A brilliant laptop that offers a buttery smooth and seamless experience even for high-end users. If you are in the Samsung eco-system, you get some additional perks and if you aren't, still you will have great fun. With 120 Hz, you might see a little battery drain, but with all the goodness popping up the screen, you wouldn't mind charging a bit more. Mind you, the fast charging is actually pretty fast. While the touchpad is shockingly big and ugly, it is also practical and effective.

So, all in all, a great Samsung purchase that will hopefully stand the test of time.

Note: There are absolutely zero accessories available for this laptop right now at Samsung Store. Mouse is not available, the pouch doesn't come in its size. A laptop of this size and price needs to have some accessories to go with it. It's not practical to carry such a big laptop in hand or a bulky bag at all times. Samsung, hope you are listening!!!; The laptop doesn't support Windows hello since the camera provided in this laptop is not Infrared(IR). It is Intel(R) AVStream Camera.
Also, the screen is said to be tough since it's a premium laptop but my screen has got a crack when I placed another laptop over it during travel.; It delivers the performance that it promises. It‚Äôs my first Samsung Laptop, and I am happy I went for it.; Super cool"

I suggest that .; I purchased this product since the webcam of the last laptop i was using got spoilt. Though I felt this product was slightly on the expensive side, it gave me all the specs I was looking for. I loved the look and feel of this laptop and the performance so far has been pretty good. Just one observation.. I wanted to place a webcam protector/ slider cover, but so far, I'm unable to find any which fits due to the narrow borders.; Writing review for Amazon service.

Amazon has recently changed their policy with laptops, they don't allow you to return the product anymore.
I had a really really bad experience with their service and even being a prime member didn't make any difference.

so firstly the packaging was open, then laptop started behaving weirdly, I was seeing black screen at random while working on the laptop. Thirdly when I ran benchmark test software on the laptop I received it performed very poorly (24th percentile) when compared with same laptops around the globe (I suspected this when I observed that the laptop was performing slow & laggy)

I first talked to DELL service centre, the told me that they don't replace laptops, thereafter, the amazon representative requested for a technician for me. First technician marked that the issue was resolved but actually it wasn't. So I had to request for an another technician. Second technician arrived and told me that he has reported the issue with the laptop and filed for a return from his side, but he actually marked the issue as resolved without filling any return. After that I waited for whole day waiting for Amazon representative but he didn't call even after assuring me that he takes full responsibility of my issue.

So I had to call Amazon again, had to explain the whole thing again to 3 different Amazon representative. Again I got promised by an Amazon Representative that they will help me resolve the issue and call me back but NO ONE called.

So I had to again call Amazon once again, had to explain the same thing again and now I am stuck because they don't send technician the third time and since both technicians have marked the issue as resolved Amazon has denied to help. So I am basically stuck with this laptop and have lost 65K just like that and laptop is of no use to me.

I have ordered many times from Amazon but never have I expected that a brand which portrays itself to be consumer focused would do to someone who has been their user from a long time.; Vey good laptop with high refresh rate and with a good user interface experience. If you are a student and a programmer i definitely would recommend this. If you are an editor you can have a look on this. Coming back to batter it last up to 3-4 hours which is okayish. Over all i would give 4.9/5 .
#bestfromdell #amazingfromdell #dell; Very good combination of 16gb ram, iTB ssd and 13th gen i7 1360p processor. Lightweight and premium design. The only issue i facing is that got only 10 months warranty from dell; Very good condition; Since deliver i raised 2 cases to return from the APP, it was taken as Service request to check and return, both the times no one visited but case updated as ""Service completed"" for first case and customer wants to cancel the service request for second time...fraud service, only they can reach us via phone call but they can update the case the way they want and no way to control or correct from our side, worst part is we cannot reach them.

Next step, called customer care and explaining above all for 32 mins call, he generously agreed and sympathy for me very well and he said he'll escalate by filing escalation ticket to return the laptop. but later he updated the case like call got disconnected in between :-(.

Now am looking legal action via consumer court with all these documented events to get my money back.; Some times it hangs.finger print sensor not working properly. Slightly heat."

I recently purchased the multipurpose table from [online shopping platform], and I couldn't be happier with my decision. This table is a lifesaver! It's incredibly convenient and practical for various tasks around the house.

Overall a great product, must buy; It's very useful when you have ltl space and also very Good in adjusting height and table top angle...specially got for drawing n paint work on paper...good product.; Product is good, easy to assemble and sturdy.

And after use I found that on the tile surface it is little slippery"

I won't recommend this laptop for dedicated gaming tho; ; I boght this laptop for mainly multitasking and virtualization purpose, 16GB version was not available so bought 8 GB version(4x2), then I upgraded it to 32 GB crucial RAM, overall super performance and smooth no lags, installed linux alongside windows, NVMe PCIe gen 3 SSD provided and speed is also good see the speedtest image attached, I bought it for around Rs 52K after bank discount and old laptop exchange offer

here are the pros and cons of this laptop
Pros:
1) 12th gen CPU 1240P, 12 cores/16 threads ( total 16 Virtual processors).
2) Total 2 NVMe slots, 1st slot is PCIe gen 4 NVMe supported, 2nd slot PCIe gen 3).
3) backlit keyboard
4) Thunderbolt 4 supported
5) NVidia RTX 2050 with this price is worth
6) Fingerprint scan is fast

Cons:
1) Battery backup is not upto mark(around 2.5 Hrs) and sound is ok
2)Display is just normal 60Hz 1080P
3) 8GB RAM is 4x2 ( not future proof)
4) out of 2 SSD slots only 1 PCIe 4
5) No SD/microsd slot
6) No mux switch; Expected more speed from Intel i7, screens not flexible to 180 degree, rest of all good; I purchased this laptop for Rs. 46,240 during the 2023 Great Indian Festival Sale. From my perspective, here are the pros and cons:

Pros:

1. Inclusion of an i5 processor within this price range.
2. The RTX-2050 provides excellent value for money.
3. It's a lightweight laptop.
4. Impressive overall performance.

Cons:

1. The build quality is primarily plastic.
2. The keyboard feedback is subpar.
3. Lack of a Type-C charger.
4. Sound quality is unsatisfactory.
5. The label and printed information on the laptop battery appear different, raising suspicions of whether the product may be refurbished.; Ok ok .my one i bought one its battery stopped working within 2 days, then i ordered it again thats mother board stopped working within 12 days,and i couldn't return it as amazon hives only 7 days replacement,so finally after months of requesting and calling, i decided to get it repaired.that they did very fast and currently its working well.; The laptop is good for this price point.
First Day review.
1) Noticed that in multi core performance mode the max cpu frequency was around 2.57Ghz. I think this might be some bios issue. Where as in single core mode cpu runs at its full clock speed (4.1Ghz).
2) The laptop fan has zero noise at low load and when cpu runs at its high clock speed the noise is a bit loud (not very loud).
3) R23 cinebench single core :1657
multi core : 6200
4)Speakers and battery backup are mediocre.
5) Ram 4+4 GB ok dual channel, better than single 8 GB but problem upgrading wise.

After 3 days ( installing windows updates and drivers)
1) cinebench multicore test : 8500 pts.
2) single core : 1650 pts
3) Battery backup increased to 4-5 hrs. (good battery life)
4)Thermals are outstanding max 75¬∞C (during 4-5 hr stretch)
5) Loving this laptop so far.; Cpu 12th gen i5 with 12 core (8efficient+4high perf)
Nvidia rtx series gddr6 4gb gpu perfect mid ranger

Usb 3.2 pen drive if connected it can transfer upto 1gb/s copy speed. I tested.
Windows 11 optimum speed and battery balanced as compared to 10. So this pc is good
I bought for 47k,
Adapter 90w medium speed charging...0-100 in 1hour 20mins around..battery is good capacity unlike other brands don't give 50ah, others have 30-40 only
First I compared with Lenovo, it has 11th gen only cpu, also gpu nvidia GTX only. So this pc same price they provide...so this acer is very discounted price brand.

Only negative is touch pad not soo fast..it slow..but works...better use external mouse...perfect...

Every laptop has pros and cons.. this laptop touch pad little low sensitivity...little over heat only..because gpu is there when we play games...
If you are expert go for this GPU pc, otherwise go for non GPU pc"

If you are not a gamer, laptop is heavy, big and not easy to carry. It also do not have a fingerprint reader( Weirdly my first laptop without one apart from my first Toshiba from 2013).
Battery life is really bad
I also was not able to extend the warranty for the product from my acer app
Good
good screen, fast processor, customizable keyboard and fan.; Best at this price range for sure no lag while gaming sare game chala diye most of the big games like gta 5 , froza horizon 5, sab smoothly run krta hai ache graphics main ‚úÖ updates ke baad battery jaldi drain hoti hai but kuch din main it adapts wapas back to normal ho jata hai; This laptop is literally the best laptop u could buy if you're on a budget. I got this for 70k and the price to performance is the best. The processor competes with Intel core i5 12th and the DDR 5 RAM really helps in gaming. I would genuinely recommend this laptop if ur budget is 70 - 80k

Note : Always buy the 16 GB RAM variant bcz come on it 2024, u atleast need 16 GB RAM for best gaming performance.; The laptop crashes randomly, the battery drains very fast. Even with normal tasks the battery drains in 1.5 hours. Total waste of money; Excellent product, I brought AMD Version so battery exceed my expectations.. Display color could have been more better...
RTX 3050 gaming performance is really great

16GB DdR5 ram but even though laptop has 2 slots I got one 16GB STICK only..

Fans has slight noice, when it's run in full speed

Overall if you don't have problem with display color,you can go for it; Here is honest review you might be looking for
Like this laptop is must buy laptop under 62k
Good thermals
Beast performance
4-5 hours backup while doing smalls tasks
2-3 while gaming
Sturdy build quality
Good keyboard with RGB
DISPLAY Is just amazing
Only cons of the laptop is it's doesn't come with lifetime MS office; Best laptop in budget, i got RYZEN 7 7735HS 16 GB in 65740‚Çπ and in this budget, this laptop is out standing in specs it provides. Acer Nitro Sense is quite very amazing and manges heating issues properly, i have played many games like GTA 5, Froza Horizon, and Call Of Duty, this laptop never disappointed me...
At last if you get this machine under 70k go for it.. its really worth buying."

Initially, it was not powering up. Battery was dead, but charging it brought it back to life. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have much time to explore it because it had other issues as well‚Äîspecifically, the display was faulty.
I promptly complained to Amazon, and the situation escalated from there:

On May 15th -
no one from Amazon or pick up service showed up and the scheduled pickup was canceled citing verification failure .
After contacting customer service, they assured me it wasn‚Äôt a major issue and rescheduled the pickup while registering a complaint against the pickup service.

The next pickup date was May 17th-
but once again, no one came to pick up the laptop. Surprisingly, I received a notification stating that the pickup was denied by the customer, which never happened.

On May 20th, the same scenario repeated, and a new pickup date was assigned.

Unfortunately, on May 21st, no pickup occurred because no one showed up.

Now, despite all these events, the customer service team claims that internal checks reveal the pickup was denied by me, and they won‚Äôt take any further action since the product was deemed to be in good condition.""; ; Liked It; Worst service by Amazon got defective piece can‚Äôt return or replace just get repair only misbehaving technician named Aditya something got help by dell so highly recommended not to buy from online; Facing Heating Issues
Battery Backup is also poor
Power adapter is not fitting into normal socket needs Refrigerator/AC power socket to charge
Worst part is Amazon not returning it without visiting Dell Service Center and letter that they can't solve your issue, which is not going to happen.
So Please be aware of it before you purchase it; I have received laptop without user manual. Also screen is flickering. Please return this laptop as i am sure it is refurbished product; Extreme Over heating problem, irritating fan noise on very second day of purchase.; Laptop physically very good no doubt. Performance every thing is good but the main draw back is battery life is only 1hrs. If you have to use this laptop you have use with charging this is not travel friendly laptop"

CPU is low-power series within i5 (1240p). As a result, it doesn't perform as snappily as 12400h, which consumes far more power, and will deplete your battery faster. But overall, it's acceptable, it won't blow you away.
The GPU is the only ampere class gpu in the 2000 series, and performs decently. Almost mid-range performance.
RAM is DDR4. If you really have the budget, go for a model with DDR5 and higher clock (4800 MHz) RAM. These days, the bottleneck in performance is at the RAM level.
But for Rs 46k (after offers) in Diwali 2023, this one was the cheapest laptop with a discrete GPU and a 12th or 13th Gen processor.; Acer Aspire 5 cons: 1) Not that fast
2) Very low speaker sound
3) Games run on 35-40 fps max thats all you get
4) Nvidia Graphic card is only 15watts
5) No usb type c slot
6) No DVD writer ( you dont need it in 2023)
7) Cannot add normal SSD or HDD
8) Very high power consumption
9) 4GB graphics memory insufficient to run even 2012 games (EG: GTA5 needs 6gb atleast for good qualilty., rest of the games post 2023 need atleast 12 GB graphics memory)
10) Insufficient cooling vents. Only one vent on the right top of the laptop below the screen.
11) Gets very hot not suitable to place on lap or it will burn your skin.

Pros: 1) Decent Screen quality and size
2) 3 usb slots( 2 on left and one on right) + Thunderbolt slot +lan cable slot + HDMI slot + 3.5mm headphone jack included
3) Decent for video and audio editing
4) Not made for hardcore gamers or graphic editing
5) Battery is 1.3 hours backup
6) HD webcam included
7) Mouse trackpad is good and it has fingerprint reader on the left of trackpad
8) Wifi 6E (Removable adapter inside the laptop)
9) 256GB NVME SSD included. ( one additional slot for NVME ssd)
10) 12th gen intel i5 cpu very good. 12 core cpu.
11) 4 GB graphics memory NVIDIA with cuda cores.
12) 16 Gb ram included very fast
13) Backlight keyboard only white light
14) Drivers readily available online on intel and Acer websites
15) Supports bluetooth mics headphones all for online meetings even usb heaphones supported. But bluetooth mic should be of good quality.
16) Runs hot during gaming.
17) Medium weight laptop and a bit thick.
18) Aluminium frame. Does leak a bit of current on the top of laptop when you touch it. It can be solved with proper earthing wire.
19) Suggested to buy another keyboard and mouse so that you dont damage its keyboard inbuilt.
20) Supports windows 11 home. Windows 11 pro can be bought on microsoft store if you want encryption of drives.(Bitlocker)
21) 1080p resolution lcd screen.

I think there are better laptops out there in this price range. I only bought this laptop for wifi 6E and backlight keyboard. Better get a touch screen LED type for battery savings and dont pay for windows 11 pro. If possible get a DOS laptop and purchase windows 10 home.

For gaming i wont recommend, it only has 4gb ddr4 graphics memory which is too low in todays standards.

The bios does not have fan speed or voltage control options.

Booting speed is good. Boots under 5 seconds.; So first of all I wanna say I'm writing this review after a use of almost a month and this will be a long but so beneficial for everyone.

So far I'm happy with the product as I realised that this is not a top level gaming like Asus tuf but actually its far better than Asus Tuf Gaming or other gaming laptops in this price range because this purpose is actually for people who don't do much of gaming and do other tasks, though even if you do so play whatever you want it will give you 60 fps in forza horizon 5 at 720p so the heaviest game is going smooth and so on for hours probably we can say its actually for gaming purpose with a look of non gaming laptops so some may find it fascinating and some may not because if you're a student so more likely people will surely mock you if they see using gaming laptop even if you don't do any gaming and study only but we know relatives,, let's get back to topic so as per now its clear that performance is top notch and now it comes on video playback like what is the highest quality you can watch videos on YouTube so first of all to do that I would like to inform that you must first do some setups like turning on GPU and then doing other settings like always optimize for quality and performance and you also have to do it for Forza Horizon 5 if you wants 60fps in 720p otherwise if its turned off then you'll get upset so must turn on GPU as its off by default so turn it on then enjoy so after turning on you are actually able to play 8K videos on YouTube without any lag so that's such an amazing thing because people sometimes are confused regarding will it give you 4K quality or not and here it's giving you 8K quality on YouTube but it is a thing to be noted like most of the content of YouTube is actually 1080p content especially all series and movies so obviously this 8K video streaming is good but not a reason for one should buy this so what's the reason?? Absolutely the performance which is outstanding though that doesn't mean we should ignore this 8K superiority as this shows the capability of this amazing tech and the graphic card RTX2050 have good fans so that's also good for keeping it little cool so not much heating problem and build quality is amazing and due to being aluminium while plugged in you may feel some slight shocks which is like a vibration so don't be worried at all its just ok as its back cover is of aluminium so don't Worry of it as no big shocks it just feels like a vibration so don't worry next thing is the battery backup after you turn it on to the performance mode then battery last upto almost 3 hours on slight usage if you do gaming you can see how fast it drains so don't do gaming while its not plugged in so overall this is all good and it may look suspicious as why there ain't any cons in this laptop so don't worry here are CONS:

First of all and always note that this laptop is not for gaming if you do gaming then absolutely its not for you not at all

It doesn't come with MS office so those who use ms office a lot so please stay away from this because you'll have to pay extra money for MS office but the question does it worth it to purchase ms office? So the answer is depends upon how you wanna use like slight gaming, multimedia etc. Then ofcourse this is worth it and if not then no don't go for it

No free features üò≠ you gotta buy everything so man!! That can make it costly if you use Adobe, MS office, and any other paid subscription app because no matter what just pay!! So again does it worth to be pay so much after purchasing it so that depends on you because you know what you want so here in this case you have to check though it works best and overall performance is good but does it require all that thing well upto you!!

Perhaps for people who do other things especially study and believe this is actually for students because students do slight gaming and other things so for students nothing is better than this though profesinalist can also use because I can say its worth it as I've used because its very easy to use and everything so clean so just now upto you

I just hope this long review could help someone; Attention to anyone considering buying this laptop! Let me recount my experience: I purchased an Acer laptop and used it for about a month without any issues. However, it started overheating and the battery was draining rapidly. On November 18, 2023, the laptop abruptly shut down. I contacted the service center immediately, and on November 21, an engineer came to inspect the laptop. They identified a damaged motherboard and said it needed replacement, estimating a 2 to 3-day wait. After returning on November 28 with a new motherboard, they attempted to install it, but the laptop failed to start. The engineer suspected another issue with the replacement motherboard, necessitating another service request and an additional 3 to 4-day wait. As of December 5, the laptop remains unrepaired. This experience has been frustrating, considering the purpose for which I bought the laptop. I'm sharing this to shed light on the situation for everyone's awareness.""

I have been using it for more then 3 months and I am very happy with the performance.
Note that my other machine is a macbook pro M3, with 32 GB RAM.

Coding, movies, document editing, browsing, etc has no performance lags.
It is lightweight, battery life is good enough. Lasts 3+ hours easily.
I use Up/Down arrow keys a lot, and this laptop has the best sized keys.

The only drawback is the sound volume. It is not good enough. Though if you use headsets or external speakers, then no issues.

Display is okay.

It is a workhorse machine. No fancy features, but it has everything to get your work done.; Use after one week I am writing this review. Great laptop at average cost, lightweight, performance is good, also laptop body is good and slim in 15.6 inch.; This Acer inspire lite model (i5 11th gen) is a great value for money product. It has sp many spec like 16 GB ram (expandable) , 512 GB SSD (expandable), intel i5 11th gen processor. A laptop with all these specs cost more than 50k (you can compare it with other brands like HP, LENOVA, DELL, etc - you'll find that this laptop is the option under 40k with all these specs.
I have been using this laptop from last 5 days and I am really happy with the laptop's quality.

Pros:
- Great build quality (Metal alloy body)
- Good processor (i5 11th gen)
- FHD screen
- budget friendly
-180¬∞ hinge
- dual storage capable (SSD + HDD)
- Good battery backup
- C type port

Cons:
- No backlight keyboard
- No Camera privacy shutter
- Okish Sound quality

Great for students and working professionals with normal to medium level usage.
All in all it's a great product!; I had received the product on 5 Oct and found that power button not working on same day. Amazon promised inspection by agent in 48 hours, but the inspection happened only on 11 Oct that is 6 days. After the service engineer verified that the system is faulty, Amazon said they are to arrange a pick up in next 48 hours, that is by 13th. Today is 18th end of day, nobody has picked up despite repeated intimation. Now, I can't talk to Amazon helpline also, presumably they have blocked my number (?). So now I am stuck with a defective product, money held up with hostile Amazon. BTW, most service agents who attend calls in the day time are rude as well. I suppose the combination of this vendor and Amazon does not work well.; Laptop is not upto my expectations with display, sound and usability.; It's working good. Looks cool and functioning well üíØ. Good one. But i feel like battery life is somewhat a issue; This is a good product for my requirement. I do a music production and a little bit of coding. Fabulous display, great battery life. Recommended if you are looking for a good laptop at decent price; Slim design, Light weight :less than 1.6 kg.

Firstly, I did notice mild electric current when the laptop is charging but it is only at metal surface which top of screen - i dont touch it anyway :)

Here is my feedback per feature:

Usage - i use this laptop atleast 3-4hours a day for productivity purposes - i dont play games and i mainly use it for programming

Build quality - The laptop looks great initially however after some time the usage marks on keyboard, touchpad appear quickly, the hinges which hold the screen could have been improved, the screen falls down if it at a certain angle and is not firm
Although it says metal body but feels plastic all over.

Keyboard - this full keyboard is missing one column in the number pad - usually the last column contains + - and enter key but they have omitted that here and it will take sometime to get used to. In short keyboard is not full. However overall it is ok to type to - there is ample space for wrist support.

Heat dissipation - the Fans are right at the bottom and they make a lot of noise when laptop is heated - you will need a cooling pad to keep this laptop cool and if you plan work on your lap wear insulated clothing - in short this laptop cant work on a lap :)

Fingerprint - it is new feature for me in laptop and it works sometimes and sometimes it doesnt

Video / Audio - No complaints.

Battery - With the apps which i run i get 1.5-2hours of backup easily however i assume this would go down eventually but i don't mind keeping it plugged in

Cost - I dont think this laptop is made for rough use - if taken enough care this would survive for years and this configuration at 31k is definitely value for money - similar configuration is minimum 10k more

Lastly, i will recommend this laptop for students and people like me who are on a budget; Display is good but hinge loose but ok and built quality looks average, keyboard is kind of low quality,looks sleek and weight less, with a poor battery life, Fan sounds noisy but speaker sound is good comparitively and also heating too much but liberation of heat via body and fan too poor.charging time is too bad but c type charger is provided and all the port are too tight ... the USB ports and hdmi port. A bit on slow side.It feels like a low quality product with good style and sleek look.This is my personal opinion on the device after using for a while buying it or not is all upto you.; The zebronic I7 model I purchased through Amazon and it worth me nearly half a lakh and they cheated me by giving the refurbished where the product keys are mis matched like @ is mis matched with apostrophy "" and few other keys are not working and using for 1p min it's burning like fire and the processer named high and it's very slow and says quick charging but very slow and the performance are nothing totally got cheated by Amazon because I trust Amazon and buy. They cheated me; Super performance with i7 ,display-10/10
Great build ,looks classy,best things is its with dolby ,I watched movie and sound effect is just awesome, while purchasing I had the fear being this is new brand ,was having 2nd thought too ,but after getting product..decision of buying this was rt..all i can say just go fr it.; Pros:-
i7-12gen
1tb ssd (SATA roughly 100 mbits/s speed)
16 gb ram
Zebronics motherboard
Cons :-
SSD , RAM - chinese brand not of well known brands,
Fingerprint Reader sometimes become unresponsive
SSD provided is of sata which is a joke in this price segment must have pci express rather than sata , ssd name is nmve but it does support high speed data transfer
Ram chinese brand
Of course battery the most worst thing of it non removable , 2 hrs backup for playing online videos and surfing internet , if you used heavy task 1 hr is max because fans are running , charging time is dreadful 3-4 hrs charging whether you use in background or not‚Ä¶..
Wifi 5- which means you dont get wifi 6 which is todays need and next gen support.
Usb C common platform for charging the device , if you use by chance in phone then no one is responsible

Final verdict:-
Price is high according to specs providers .
Build quality is below par.Display quality is below par.Ram is average.SSD is below par.
Go with other brands like MSI you will get better specs interms of connection dont get fooled here.; Best part of this laptop is performance and speed. You can do multitasking and Can edit videos. Photoshop is working very smooth and All editing software's are working excellent. webcam quality was pretty good.

Coming to drawbacks Battery was week. Draining very fast and to charge 100%, it is taking minimum of 4hrs. build quality of keyboard and complete edges of laptop was very poor. It wont seems work for long time.

Pros:
Performance
Value for money
High end software's working smoothly
webcam

cons:
Battery
Build quality
Keyboard; Hi this sai sundeep. I was sharing my happiness of purchasing budget friendly cost with high configurations. I am totally satisfied with design and performance thanks to zebronics team it's a great design with sound quality is to good with dolby support.; Just bought 3-daya back.. received in good condition... Performance very good for day today works. But lack many little little features which reputed brands like HP, Dell, Lenovo etc provide like backlit Keys, scroll on touch pad, better front camera/webcam , detachable battery, Microsoft Office etc. The only advantage is it's i7 processor with 16 GB RAM, 1TB ROM and economic cost. Battery back up 3-5 hrs depending on use... let's see after few months"

The con and drawback is the display Panal is only 60fps so more fps is useless. Would suggest people to buy it if it's for medium gaming and easier carrying due to its weight. I won't recommend this laptop for dedicated gaming tho; ; I boght this laptop for mainly multitasking and virtualization purpose, 16GB version was not available so bought 8 GB version(4x2), then I upgraded it to 32 GB crucial RAM, overall super performance and smooth no lags, installed linux alongside windows, NVMe PCIe gen 3 SSD provided and speed is also good see the speedtest image attached, I bought it for around Rs 52K after bank discount and old laptop exchange offer

here are the pros and cons of this laptop
Pros:
1) 12th gen CPU 1240P, 12 cores/16 threads ( total 16 Virtual processors).
2) Total 2 NVMe slots, 1st slot is PCIe gen 4 NVMe supported, 2nd slot PCIe gen 3).
3) backlit keyboard
4) Thunderbolt 4 supported
5) NVidia RTX 2050 with this price is worth
6) Fingerprint scan is fast

Cons:
1) Battery backup is not upto mark(around 2.5 Hrs) and sound is ok
2)Display is just normal 60Hz 1080P
3) 8GB RAM is 4x2 ( not future proof)
4) out of 2 SSD slots only 1 PCIe 4
5) No SD/microsd slot
6) No mux switch; Expected more speed from Intel i7, screens not flexible to 180 degree, rest of all good; I purchased this laptop for Rs. 46,240 during the 2023 Great Indian Festival Sale. From my perspective, here are the pros and cons:

Pros:

1. Inclusion of an i5 processor within this price range.
2. The RTX-2050 provides excellent value for money.
3. It's a lightweight laptop.
4. Impressive overall performance.

Cons:

1. The build quality is primarily plastic.
2. The keyboard feedback is subpar.
3. Lack of a Type-C charger.
4. Sound quality is unsatisfactory.
5. The label and printed information on the laptop battery appear different, raising suspicions of whether the product may be refurbished.; Ok ok .my one i bought one its battery stopped working within 2 days, then i ordered it again thats mother board stopped working within 12 days,and i couldn't return it as amazon hives only 7 days replacement,so finally after months of requesting and calling, i decided to get it repaired.that they did very fast and currently its working well.; The laptop is good for this price point.
First Day review.
1) Noticed that in multi core performance mode the max cpu frequency was around 2.57Ghz. I think this might be some bios issue. Where as in single core mode cpu runs at its full clock speed (4.1Ghz).
2) The laptop fan has zero noise at low load and when cpu runs at its high clock speed the noise is a bit loud (not very loud).
3) R23 cinebench single core :1657
multi core : 6200
4)Speakers and battery backup are mediocre.
5) Ram 4+4 GB ok dual channel, better than single 8 GB but problem upgrading wise.

After 3 days ( installing windows updates and drivers)
1) cinebench multicore test : 8500 pts.
2) single core : 1650 pts
3) Battery backup increased to 4-5 hrs. (good battery life)
4)Thermals are outstanding max 75¬∞C (during 4-5 hr stretch)
5) Loving this laptop so far.; Cpu 12th gen i5 with 12 core (8efficient+4high perf)
Nvidia rtx series gddr6 4gb gpu perfect mid ranger
Storage is Western digitals brand fitted
Panasonic 3cell 50whr battery
Wifi and bt is Intel
Audio is realtek
Ethernet is Atheros branded.
Thunderbolt 4 type USB c 3.2 generation 4
Usb 3.2 pen drive if connected it can transfer upto 1gb/s copy speed. I tested.
Windows 11 optimum speed and battery balanced as compared to 10. So this pc is good
I bought for 47k,
Adapter 90w medium speed charging...0-100 in 1hour 20mins around..battery is good capacity unlike other brands don't give 50ah, others have 30-40 only
First I compared with Lenovo, it has 11th gen only cpu, also gpu nvidia GTX only. So this pc same price they provide...so this acer is very discounted price brand.

Only negative is touch pad not soo fast..it slow..but works...better use external mouse...perfect...

Every laptop has pros and cons.. this laptop touch pad little low sensitivity...little over heat only..because gpu is there when we play games...
If you are expert go for this GPU pc, otherwise go for non GPU pc"

If you are not a gamer, laptop is heavy, big and not easy to carry. It also do not have a fingerprint reader( Weirdly my first laptop without one apart from my first Toshiba from 2013).
Battery life is really bad
I also was not able to extend the warranty for the product from my acer app
Good
good screen, fast processor, customizable keyboard and fan.; Best at this price range for sure no lag while gaming sare game chala diye most of the big games like gta 5 , froza horizon 5, sab smoothly run krta hai ache graphics main ‚úÖ updates ke baad battery jaldi drain hoti hai but kuch din main it adapts wapas back to normal ho jata hai; This laptop is literally the best laptop u could buy if you're on a budget. I got this for 70k and the price to performance is the best. The processor competes with Intel core i5 12th and the DDR 5 RAM really helps in gaming. I would genuinely recommend this laptop if ur budget is 70 - 80k

Note : Always buy the 16 GB RAM variant bcz come on it 2024, u atleast need 16 GB RAM for best gaming performance.; The laptop crashes randomly, the battery drains very fast. Even with normal tasks the battery drains in 1.5 hours. Total waste of money; Excellent product, I brought AMD Version so battery exceed my expectations.. Display color could have been more better...
RTX 3050 gaming performance is really great

16GB DdR5 ram but even though laptop has 2 slots I got one 16GB STICK only..

Fans has slight noice, when it's run in full speed

Overall if you don't have problem with display color,you can go for it; Here is honest review you might be looking for
Like this laptop is must buy laptop under 62k
Good thermals
Beast performance
4-5 hours backup while doing smalls tasks
2-3 while gaming
Sturdy build quality
Good keyboard with RGB
DISPLAY Is just amazing
Only cons of the laptop is it's doesn't come with lifetime MS office; Best laptop in budget, i got RYZEN 7 7735HS 16 GB in 65740‚Çπ and in this budget, this laptop is out standing in specs it provides. Acer Nitro Sense is quite very amazing and manges heating issues properly, i have played many games like GTA 5, Froza Horizon, and Call Of Duty, this laptop never disappointed me...
At last if you get this machine under 70k go for it.. its really worth buying."

Initially, it was not powering up. Battery was dead, but charging it brought it back to life. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have much time to explore it because it had other issues as well‚Äîspecifically, the display was faulty.
I promptly complained to Amazon, and the situation escalated from there:

On May 15th -
no one from Amazon or pick up service showed up and the scheduled pickup was canceled citing verification failure .
After contacting customer service, they assured me it wasn‚Äôt a major issue and rescheduled the pickup while registering a complaint against the pickup service.

The next pickup date was May 17th-
but once again, no one came to pick up the laptop. Surprisingly, I received a notification stating that the pickup was denied by the customer, which never happened.

On May 20th, the same scenario repeated, and a new pickup date was assigned.

Unfortunately, on May 21st, no pickup occurred because no one showed up.

Now, despite all these events, the customer service team claims that internal checks reveal the pickup was denied by me, and they won‚Äôt take any further action since the product was deemed to be in good condition.""; ; Liked It; Worst service by Amazon got defective piece can‚Äôt return or replace just get repair only misbehaving technician named Aditya something got help by dell so highly recommended not to buy from online; Facing Heating Issues
Battery Backup is also poor
Power adapter is not fitting into normal socket needs Refrigerator/AC power socket to charge
Worst part is Amazon not returning it without visiting Dell Service Center and letter that they can't solve your issue, which is not going to happen.
So Please be aware of it before you purchase it; I have received laptop without user manual. Also screen is flickering. Please return this laptop as i am sure it is refurbished product; Extreme Over heating problem, irritating fan noise on very second day of purchase.; Laptop physically very good no doubt. Performance every thing is good but the main draw back is battery life is only 1hrs. If you have to use this laptop you have use with charging this is not travel friendly laptop"

CPU is low-power series within i5 (1240p). As a result, it doesn't perform as snappily as 12400h, which consumes far more power, and will deplete your battery faster. But overall, it's acceptable, it won't blow you away.
The GPU is the only ampere class gpu in the 2000 series, and performs decently. Almost mid-range performance.
RAM is DDR4. If you really have the budget, go for a model with DDR5 and higher clock (4800 MHz) RAM. These days, the bottleneck in performance is at the RAM level.
But for Rs 46k (after offers) in Diwali 2023, this one was the cheapest laptop with a discrete GPU and a 12th or 13th Gen processor.; Acer Aspire 5 cons: 1) Not that fast
2) Very low speaker sound
3) Games run on 35-40 fps max thats all you get
4) Nvidia Graphic card is only 15watts
5) No usb type c slot
6) No DVD writer ( you dont need it in 2023)
7) Cannot add normal SSD or HDD
8) Very high power consumption
9) 4GB graphics memory insufficient to run even 2012 games (EG: GTA5 needs 6gb atleast for good qualilty., rest of the games post 2023 need atleast 12 GB graphics memory)
10) Insufficient cooling vents. Only one vent on the right top of the laptop below the screen.
11) Gets very hot not suitable to place on lap or it will burn your skin.

Pros: 1) Decent Screen quality and size
2) 3 usb slots( 2 on left and one on right) + Thunderbolt slot +lan cable slot + HDMI slot + 3.5mm headphone jack included
3) Decent for video and audio editing
4) Not made for hardcore gamers or graphic editing
5) Battery is 1.3 hours backup
6) HD webcam included
7) Mouse trackpad is good and it has fingerprint reader on the left of trackpad
8) Wifi 6E (Removable adapter inside the laptop)
9) 256GB NVME SSD included. ( one additional slot for NVME ssd)
10) 12th gen intel i5 cpu very good. 12 core cpu.
11) 4 GB graphics memory NVIDIA with cuda cores.
12) 16 Gb ram included very fast
13) Backlight keyboard only white light
14) Drivers readily available online on intel and Acer websites
15) Supports bluetooth mics headphones all for online meetings even usb heaphones supported. But bluetooth mic should be of good quality.
16) Runs hot during gaming.
17) Medium weight laptop and a bit thick.
18) Aluminium frame. Does leak a bit of current on the top of laptop when you touch it. It can be solved with proper earthing wire.
19) Suggested to buy another keyboard and mouse so that you dont damage its keyboard inbuilt.
20) Supports windows 11 home. Windows 11 pro can be bought on microsoft store if you want encryption of drives.(Bitlocker)
21) 1080p resolution lcd screen.

I think there are better laptops out there in this price range. I only bought this laptop for wifi 6E and backlight keyboard. Better get a touch screen LED type for battery savings and dont pay for windows 11 pro. If possible get a DOS laptop and purchase windows 10 home.

For gaming i wont recommend, it only has 4gb ddr4 graphics memory which is too low in todays standards.

The bios does not have fan speed or voltage control options.

Booting speed is good. Boots under 5 seconds.; So first of all I wanna say I'm writing this review after a use of almost a month and this will be a long but so beneficial for everyone.

So far I'm happy with the product as I realised that this is not a top level gaming like Asus tuf but actually its far better than Asus Tuf Gaming or other gaming laptops in this price range because this purpose is actually for people who don't do much of gaming and do other tasks, though even if you do so play whatever you want it will give you 60 fps in forza horizon 5 at 720p so the heaviest game is going smooth and so on for hours probably we can say its actually for gaming purpose with a look of non gaming laptops so some may find it fascinating and some may not because if you're a student so more likely people will surely mock you if they see using gaming laptop even if you don't do any gaming and study only but we know relatives,, let's get back to topic so as per now its clear that performance is top notch and now it comes on video playback like what is the highest quality you can watch videos on YouTube so first of all to do that I would like to inform that you must first do some setups like turning on GPU and then doing other settings like always optimize for quality and performance and you also have to do it for Forza Horizon 5 if you wants 60fps in 720p otherwise if its turned off then you'll get upset so must turn on GPU as its off by default so turn it on then enjoy so after turning on you are actually able to play 8K videos on YouTube without any lag so that's such an amazing thing because people sometimes are confused regarding will it give you 4K quality or not and here it's giving you 8K quality on YouTube but it is a thing to be noted like most of the content of YouTube is actually 1080p content especially all series and movies so obviously this 8K video streaming is good but not a reason for one should buy this so what's the reason?? Absolutely the performance which is outstanding though that doesn't mean we should ignore this 8K superiority as this shows the capability of this amazing tech and the graphic card RTX2050 have good fans so that's also good for keeping it little cool so not much heating problem and build quality is amazing and due to being aluminium while plugged in you may feel some slight shocks which is like a vibration so don't be worried at all its just ok as its back cover is of aluminium so don't Worry of it as no big shocks it just feels like a vibration so don't worry next thing is the battery backup after you turn it on to the performance mode then battery last upto almost 3 hours on slight usage if you do gaming you can see how fast it drains so don't do gaming while its not plugged in so overall this is all good and it may look suspicious as why there ain't any cons in this laptop so don't worry here are CONS:

First of all and always note that this laptop is not for gaming if you do gaming then absolutely its not for you not at all

It doesn't come with MS office so those who use ms office a lot so please stay away from this because you'll have to pay extra money for MS office but the question does it worth it to purchase ms office? So the answer is depends upon how you wanna use like slight gaming, multimedia etc. Then ofcourse this is worth it and if not then no don't go for it

No free features üò≠ you gotta buy everything so man!! That can make it costly if you use Adobe, MS office, and any other paid subscription app because no matter what just pay!! So again does it worth to be pay so much after purchasing it so that depends on you because you know what you want so here in this case you have to check though it works best and overall performance is good but does it require all that thing well upto you!!

Perhaps for people who do other things especially study and believe this is actually for students because students do slight gaming and other things so for students nothing is better than this though profesinalist can also use because I can say its worth it as I've used because its very easy to use and everything so clean so just now upto you

I just hope this long review could help someone; Attention to anyone considering buying this laptop! Let me recount my experience: I purchased an Acer laptop and used it for about a month without any issues. However, it started overheating and the battery was draining rapidly. On November 18, 2023, the laptop abruptly shut down. I contacted the service center immediately, and on November 21, an engineer came to inspect the laptop. They identified a damaged motherboard and said it needed replacement, estimating a 2 to 3-day wait. After returning on November 28 with a new motherboard, they attempted to install it, but the laptop failed to start. The engineer suspected another issue with the replacement motherboard, necessitating another service request and an additional 3 to 4-day wait. As of December 5, the laptop remains unrepaired. This experience has been frustrating, considering the purpose for which I bought the laptop. I'm sharing this to shed light on the situation for everyone's awareness.""

One of the very few which offers 1 TB of space below 60k.

I have been using it for more then 3 months and I am very happy with the performance.
Note that my other machine is a macbook pro M3, with 32 GB RAM.

Coding, movies, document editing, browsing, etc has no performance lags.
It is lightweight, battery life is good enough. Lasts 3+ hours easily.
I use Up/Down arrow keys a lot, and this laptop has the best sized keys.

The only drawback is the sound volume. It is not good enough. Though if you use headsets or external speakers, then no issues.

Display is okay.

It is a workhorse machine. No fancy features, but it has everything to get your work done.; Use after one week I am writing this review. Great laptop at average cost, lightweight, performance is good, also laptop body is good and slim in 15.6 inch.; This Acer inspire lite model (i5 11th gen) is a great value for money product. It has sp many spec like 16 GB ram (expandable) , 512 GB SSD (expandable), intel i5 11th gen processor. A laptop with all these specs cost more than 50k (you can compare it with other brands like HP, LENOVA, DELL, etc - you'll find that this laptop is the option under 40k with all these specs.
I have been using this laptop from last 5 days and I am really happy with the laptop's quality.

Pros:
- Great build quality (Metal alloy body)
- Good processor (i5 11th gen)
- FHD screen
- budget friendly
-180¬∞ hinge
- dual storage capable (SSD + HDD)
- Good battery backup
- C type port

Cons:
- No backlight keyboard
- No Camera privacy shutter
- Okish Sound quality

Great for students and working professionals with normal to medium level usage.
All in all it's a great product!; I had received the product on 5 Oct and found that power button not working on same day. Amazon promised inspection by agent in 48 hours, but the inspection happened only on 11 Oct that is 6 days. After the service engineer verified that the system is faulty, Amazon said they are to arrange a pick up in next 48 hours, that is by 13th. Today is 18th end of day, nobody has picked up despite repeated intimation. Now, I can't talk to Amazon helpline also, presumably they have blocked my number (?). So now I am stuck with a defective product, money held up with hostile Amazon. BTW, most service agents who attend calls in the day time are rude as well. I suppose the combination of this vendor and Amazon does not work well.; Laptop is not upto my expectations with display, sound and usability.; It's working good. Looks cool and functioning well üíØ. Good one. But i feel like battery life is somewhat a issue; This is a good product for my requirement. I do a music production and a little bit of coding. Fabulous display, great battery life. Recommended if you are looking for a good laptop at decent price; Slim design, Light weight :less than 1.6 kg.

Firstly, I did notice mild electric current when the laptop is charging but it is only at metal surface which top of screen - i dont touch it anyway :)

Here is my feedback per feature:

Usage - i use this laptop atleast 3-4hours a day for productivity purposes - i dont play games and i mainly use it for programming

Build quality - The laptop looks great initially however after some time the usage marks on keyboard, touchpad appear quickly, the hinges which hold the screen could have been improved, the screen falls down if it at a certain angle and is not firm
Although it says metal body but feels plastic all over.

Keyboard - this full keyboard is missing one column in the number pad - usually the last column contains + - and enter key but they have omitted that here and it will take sometime to get used to. In short keyboard is not full. However overall it is ok to type to - there is ample space for wrist support.

Heat dissipation - the Fans are right at the bottom and they make a lot of noise when laptop is heated - you will need a cooling pad to keep this laptop cool and if you plan work on your lap wear insulated clothing - in short this laptop cant work on a lap :)

Fingerprint - it is new feature for me in laptop and it works sometimes and sometimes it doesnt

Video / Audio - No complaints.

Battery - With the apps which i run i get 1.5-2hours of backup easily however i assume this would go down eventually but i don't mind keeping it plugged in

Cost - I dont think this laptop is made for rough use - if taken enough care this would survive for years and this configuration at 31k is definitely value for money - similar configuration is minimum 10k more

Lastly, i will recommend this laptop for students and people like me who are on a budget; Display is good but hinge loose but ok and built quality looks average, keyboard is kind of low quality,looks sleek and weight less, with a poor battery life, Fan sounds noisy but speaker sound is good comparitively and also heating too much but liberation of heat via body and fan too poor.charging time is too bad but c type charger is provided and all the port are too tight ... the USB ports and hdmi port. A bit on slow side.It feels like a low quality product with good style and sleek look.This is my personal opinion on the device after using for a while buying it or not is all upto you.; The zebronic I7 model I purchased through Amazon and it worth me nearly half a lakh and they cheated me by giving the refurbished where the product keys are mis matched like @ is mis matched with apostrophy "" and few other keys are not working and using for 1p min it's burning like fire and the processer named high and it's very slow and says quick charging but very slow and the performance are nothing totally got cheated by Amazon because I trust Amazon and buy. They cheated me; Super performance with i7 ,display-10/10
Great build ,looks classy,best things is its with dolby ,I watched movie and sound effect is just awesome, while purchasing I had the fear being this is new brand ,was having 2nd thought too ,but after getting product..decision of buying this was rt..all i can say just go fr it.; Pros:-
i7-12gen
1tb ssd (SATA roughly 100 mbits/s speed)
16 gb ram
Zebronics motherboard
Cons :-
SSD , RAM - chinese brand not of well known brands,
Fingerprint Reader sometimes become unresponsive
SSD provided is of sata which is a joke in this price segment must have pci express rather than sata , ssd name is nmve but it does support high speed data transfer
Ram chinese brand
Of course battery the most worst thing of it non removable , 2 hrs backup for playing online videos and surfing internet , if you used heavy task 1 hr is max because fans are running , charging time is dreadful 3-4 hrs charging whether you use in background or not‚Ä¶..
Wifi 5- which means you dont get wifi 6 which is todays need and next gen support.
Usb C common platform for charging the device , if you use by chance in phone then no one is responsible

Final verdict:-
Price is high according to specs providers .
Build quality is below par.Display quality is below par.Ram is average.SSD is below par.
Go with other brands like MSI you will get better specs interms of connection dont get fooled here.; Best part of this laptop is performance and speed. You can do multitasking and Can edit videos. Photoshop is working very smooth and All editing software's are working excellent. webcam quality was pretty good.

Coming to drawbacks Battery was week. Draining very fast and to charge 100%, it is taking minimum of 4hrs. build quality of keyboard and complete edges of laptop was very poor. It wont seems work for long time.

Pros:
Performance
Value for money
High end software's working smoothly
webcam

cons:
Battery
Build quality
Keyboard; Hi this sai sundeep. I was sharing my happiness of purchasing budget friendly cost with high configurations. I am totally satisfied with design and performance thanks to zebronics team it's a great design with sound quality is to good with dolby support.; Just bought 3-daya back.. received in good condition... Performance very good for day today works. But lack many little little features which reputed brands like HP, Dell, Lenovo etc provide like backlit Keys, scroll on touch pad, better front camera/webcam , detachable battery, Microsoft Office etc. The only advantage is it's i7 processor with 16 GB RAM, 1TB ROM and economic cost. Battery back up 3-5 hrs depending on use... let's see after few months"

I won't recommend this laptop for dedicated gaming tho; ; I boght this laptop for mainly multitasking and virtualization purpose, 16GB version was not available so bought 8 GB version(4x2), then I upgraded it to 32 GB crucial RAM, overall super performance and smooth no lags, installed linux alongside windows, NVMe PCIe gen 3 SSD provided and speed is also good see the speedtest image attached, I bought it for around Rs 52K after bank discount and old laptop exchange offer

here are the pros and cons of this laptop
Pros:
1) 12th gen CPU 1240P, 12 cores/16 threads ( total 16 Virtual processors).
2) Total 2 NVMe slots, 1st slot is PCIe gen 4 NVMe supported, 2nd slot PCIe gen 3).
3) backlit keyboard
4) Thunderbolt 4 supported
5) NVidia RTX 2050 with this price is worth
6) Fingerprint scan is fast

Cons:
1) Battery backup is not upto mark(around 2.5 Hrs) and sound is ok
2)Display is just normal 60Hz 1080P
3) 8GB RAM is 4x2 ( not future proof)
4) out of 2 SSD slots only 1 PCIe 4
5) No SD/microsd slot
6) No mux switch; Expected more speed from Intel i7, screens not flexible to 180 degree, rest of all good; I purchased this laptop for Rs. 46,240 during the 2023 Great Indian Festival Sale. From my perspective, here are the pros and cons:

Pros:

1. Inclusion of an i5 processor within this price range.
2. The RTX-2050 provides excellent value for money.
3. It's a lightweight laptop.
4. Impressive overall performance.

Cons:

1. The build quality is primarily plastic.
2. The keyboard feedback is subpar.
3. Lack of a Type-C charger.
4. Sound quality is unsatisfactory.
5. The label and printed information on the laptop battery appear different, raising suspicions of whether the product may be refurbished.; Ok ok .my one i bought one its battery stopped working within 2 days, then i ordered it again thats mother board stopped working within 12 days,and i couldn't return it as amazon hives only 7 days replacement,so finally after months of requesting and calling, i decided to get it repaired.that they did very fast and currently its working well.; The laptop is good for this price point.
First Day review.
1) Noticed that in multi core performance mode the max cpu frequency was around 2.57Ghz. I think this might be some bios issue. Where as in single core mode cpu runs at its full clock speed (4.1Ghz).
2) The laptop fan has zero noise at low load and when cpu runs at its high clock speed the noise is a bit loud (not very loud).
3) R23 cinebench single core :1657
multi core : 6200
4)Speakers and battery backup are mediocre.
5) Ram 4+4 GB ok dual channel, better than single 8 GB but problem upgrading wise.

After 3 days ( installing windows updates and drivers)
1) cinebench multicore test : 8500 pts.
2) single core : 1650 pts
3) Battery backup increased to 4-5 hrs. (good battery life)
4)Thermals are outstanding max 75¬∞C (during 4-5 hr stretch)
5) Loving this laptop so far.; Cpu 12th gen i5 with 12 core (8efficient+4high perf)
Nvidia rtx series gddr6 4gb gpu perfect mid ranger
Storage is Western digitals brand fitted
Panasonic 3cell 50whr battery
Wifi and bt is Intel
Audio is realtek
Ethernet is Atheros branded.
Thunderbolt 4 type USB c 3.2 generation 4
Usb 3.2 pen drive if connected it can transfer upto 1gb/s copy speed. I tested.
Windows 11 optimum speed and battery balanced as compared to 10. So this pc is good
I bought for 47k,
Adapter 90w medium speed charging...0-100 in 1hour 20mins around..battery is good capacity unlike other brands don't give 50ah, others have 30-40 only
First I compared with Lenovo, it has 11th gen only cpu, also gpu nvidia GTX only. So this pc same price they provide...so this acer is very discounted price brand.

Only negative is touch pad not soo fast..it slow..but works...better use external mouse...perfect...

Every laptop has pros and cons.. this laptop touch pad little low sensitivity...little over heat only..because gpu is there when we play games...
If you are expert go for this GPU pc, otherwise go for non GPU pc"

If you are not a gamer, laptop is heavy, big and not easy to carry. It also do not have a fingerprint reader( Weirdly my first laptop without one apart from my first Toshiba from 2013).
Battery life is really bad
I also was not able to extend the warranty for the product from my acer app
Good
good screen, fast processor, customizable keyboard and fan.; Best at this price range for sure no lag while gaming sare game chala diye most of the big games like gta 5 , froza horizon 5, sab smoothly run krta hai ache graphics main ‚úÖ updates ke baad battery jaldi drain hoti hai but kuch din main it adapts wapas back to normal ho jata hai; This laptop is literally the best laptop u could buy if you're on a budget. I got this for 70k and the price to performance is the best. The processor competes with Intel core i5 12th and the DDR 5 RAM really helps in gaming. I would genuinely recommend this laptop if ur budget is 70 - 80k

Note : Always buy the 16 GB RAM variant bcz come on it 2024, u atleast need 16 GB RAM for best gaming performance.; The laptop crashes randomly, the battery drains very fast. Even with normal tasks the battery drains in 1.5 hours. Total waste of money; Excellent product, I brought AMD Version so battery exceed my expectations.. Display color could have been more better...
RTX 3050 gaming performance is really great

16GB DdR5 ram but even though laptop has 2 slots I got one 16GB STICK only..

Fans has slight noice, when it's run in full speed

Overall if you don't have problem with display color,you can go for it; Here is honest review you might be looking for
Like this laptop is must buy laptop under 62k
Good thermals
Beast performance
4-5 hours backup while doing smalls tasks
2-3 while gaming
Sturdy build quality
Good keyboard with RGB
DISPLAY Is just amazing
Only cons of the laptop is it's doesn't come with lifetime MS office; Best laptop in budget, i got RYZEN 7 7735HS 16 GB in 65740‚Çπ and in this budget, this laptop is out standing in specs it provides. Acer Nitro Sense is quite very amazing and manges heating issues properly, i have played many games like GTA 5, Froza Horizon, and Call Of Duty, this laptop never disappointed me...
At last if you get this machine under 70k go for it.. its really worth buying."

Initially, it was not powering up. Battery was dead, but charging it brought it back to life. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have much time to explore it because it had other issues as well‚Äîspecifically, the display was faulty.
I promptly complained to Amazon, and the situation escalated from there:

On May 15th -
no one from Amazon or pick up service showed up and the scheduled pickup was canceled citing verification failure .
After contacting customer service, they assured me it wasn‚Äôt a major issue and rescheduled the pickup while registering a complaint against the pickup service.

The next pickup date was May 17th-
but once again, no one came to pick up the laptop. Surprisingly, I received a notification stating that the pickup was denied by the customer, which never happened.

On May 20th, the same scenario repeated, and a new pickup date was assigned.

Unfortunately, on May 21st, no pickup occurred because no one showed up.

Now, despite all these events, the customer service team claims that internal checks reveal the pickup was denied by me, and they won‚Äôt take any further action since the product was deemed to be in good condition.""; ; Liked It; Worst service by Amazon got defective piece can‚Äôt return or replace just get repair only misbehaving technician named Aditya something got help by dell so highly recommended not to buy from online; Facing Heating Issues
Battery Backup is also poor
Power adapter is not fitting into normal socket needs Refrigerator/AC power socket to charge
Worst part is Amazon not returning it without visiting Dell Service Center and letter that they can't solve your issue, which is not going to happen.
So Please be aware of it before you purchase it; I have received laptop without user manual. Also screen is flickering. Please return this laptop as i am sure it is refurbished product; Extreme Over heating problem, irritating fan noise on very second day of purchase.; Laptop physically very good no doubt. Performance every thing is good but the main draw back is battery life is only 1hrs. If you have to use this laptop you have use with charging this is not travel friendly laptop"

CPU is low-power series within i5 (1240p). As a result, it doesn't perform as snappily as 12400h, which consumes far more power, and will deplete your battery faster. But overall, it's acceptable, it won't blow you away.
The GPU is the only ampere class gpu in the 2000 series, and performs decently. Almost mid-range performance.
RAM is DDR4. If you really have the budget, go for a model with DDR5 and higher clock (4800 MHz) RAM. These days, the bottleneck in performance is at the RAM level.
But for Rs 46k (after offers) in Diwali 2023, this one was the cheapest laptop with a discrete GPU and a 12th or 13th Gen processor.; Acer Aspire 5 cons: 1) Not that fast
2) Very low speaker sound
3) Games run on 35-40 fps max thats all you get
4) Nvidia Graphic card is only 15watts
5) No usb type c slot
6) No DVD writer ( you dont need it in 2023)
7) Cannot add normal SSD or HDD
8) Very high power consumption
9) 4GB graphics memory insufficient to run even 2012 games (EG: GTA5 needs 6gb atleast for good qualilty., rest of the games post 2023 need atleast 12 GB graphics memory)
10) Insufficient cooling vents. Only one vent on the right top of the laptop below the screen.
11) Gets very hot not suitable to place on lap or it will burn your skin.

Pros: 1) Decent Screen quality and size
2) 3 usb slots( 2 on left and one on right) + Thunderbolt slot +lan cable slot + HDMI slot + 3.5mm headphone jack included
3) Decent for video and audio editing
4) Not made for hardcore gamers or graphic editing
5) Battery is 1.3 hours backup
6) HD webcam included
7) Mouse trackpad is good and it has fingerprint reader on the left of trackpad
8) Wifi 6E (Removable adapter inside the laptop)
9) 256GB NVME SSD included. ( one additional slot for NVME ssd)
10) 12th gen intel i5 cpu very good. 12 core cpu.
11) 4 GB graphics memory NVIDIA with cuda cores.
12) 16 Gb ram included very fast
13) Backlight keyboard only white light
14) Drivers readily available online on intel and Acer websites
15) Supports bluetooth mics headphones all for online meetings even usb heaphones supported. But bluetooth mic should be of good quality.
16) Runs hot during gaming.
17) Medium weight laptop and a bit thick.
18) Aluminium frame. Does leak a bit of current on the top of laptop when you touch it. It can be solved with proper earthing wire.
19) Suggested to buy another keyboard and mouse so that you dont damage its keyboard inbuilt.
20) Supports windows 11 home. Windows 11 pro can be bought on microsoft store if you want encryption of drives.(Bitlocker)
21) 1080p resolution lcd screen.

I think there are better laptops out there in this price range. I only bought this laptop for wifi 6E and backlight keyboard. Better get a touch screen LED type for battery savings and dont pay for windows 11 pro. If possible get a DOS laptop and purchase windows 10 home.

For gaming i wont recommend, it only has 4gb ddr4 graphics memory which is too low in todays standards.

The bios does not have fan speed or voltage control options.

Booting speed is good. Boots under 5 seconds.; So first of all I wanna say I'm writing this review after a use of almost a month and this will be a long but so beneficial for everyone.

So far I'm happy with the product as I realised that this is not a top level gaming like Asus tuf but actually its far better than Asus Tuf Gaming or other gaming laptops in this price range because this purpose is actually for people who don't do much of gaming and do other tasks, though even if you do so play whatever you want it will give you 60 fps in forza horizon 5 at 720p so the heaviest game is going smooth and so on for hours probably we can say its actually for gaming purpose with a look of non gaming laptops so some may find it fascinating and some may not because if you're a student so more likely people will surely mock you if they see using gaming laptop even if you don't do any gaming and study only but we know relatives,, let's get back to topic so as per now its clear that performance is top notch and now it comes on video playback like what is the highest quality you can watch videos on YouTube so first of all to do that I would like to inform that you must first do some setups like turning on GPU and then doing other settings like always optimize for quality and performance and you also have to do it for Forza Horizon 5 if you wants 60fps in 720p otherwise if its turned off then you'll get upset so must turn on GPU as its off by default so turn it on then enjoy so after turning on you are actually able to play 8K videos on YouTube without any lag so that's such an amazing thing because people sometimes are confused regarding will it give you 4K quality or not and here it's giving you 8K quality on YouTube but it is a thing to be noted like most of the content of YouTube is actually 1080p content especially all series and movies so obviously this 8K video streaming is good but not a reason for one should buy this so what's the reason?? Absolutely the performance which is outstanding though that doesn't mean we should ignore this 8K superiority as this shows the capability of this amazing tech and the graphic card RTX2050 have good fans so that's also good for keeping it little cool so not much heating problem and build quality is amazing and due to being aluminium while plugged in you may feel some slight shocks which is like a vibration so don't be worried at all its just ok as its back cover is of aluminium so don't Worry of it as no big shocks it just feels like a vibration so don't worry next thing is the battery backup after you turn it on to the performance mode then battery last upto almost 3 hours on slight usage if you do gaming you can see how fast it drains so don't do gaming while its not plugged in so overall this is all good and it may look suspicious as why there ain't any cons in this laptop so don't worry here are CONS:

First of all and always note that this laptop is not for gaming if you do gaming then absolutely its not for you not at all

It doesn't come with MS office so those who use ms office a lot so please stay away from this because you'll have to pay extra money for MS office but the question does it worth it to purchase ms office? So the answer is depends upon how you wanna use like slight gaming, multimedia etc. Then ofcourse this is worth it and if not then no don't go for it

No free features üò≠ you gotta buy everything so man!! That can make it costly if you use Adobe, MS office, and any other paid subscription app because no matter what just pay!! So again does it worth to be pay so much after purchasing it so that depends on you because you know what you want so here in this case you have to check though it works best and overall performance is good but does it require all that thing well upto you!!

Perhaps for people who do other things especially study and believe this is actually for students because students do slight gaming and other things so for students nothing is better than this though profesinalist can also use because I can say its worth it as I've used because its very easy to use and everything so clean so just now upto you

I just hope this long review could help someone; Attention to anyone considering buying this laptop! Let me recount my experience: I purchased an Acer laptop and used it for about a month without any issues. However, it started overheating and the battery was draining rapidly. On November 18, 2023, the laptop abruptly shut down. I contacted the service center immediately, and on November 21, an engineer came to inspect the laptop. They identified a damaged motherboard and said it needed replacement, estimating a 2 to 3-day wait. After returning on November 28 with a new motherboard, they attempted to install it, but the laptop failed to start. The engineer suspected another issue with the replacement motherboard, necessitating another service request and an additional 3 to 4-day wait. As of December 5, the laptop remains unrepaired. This experience has been frustrating, considering the purpose for which I bought the laptop. I'm sharing this to shed light on the situation for everyone's awareness.""

One of the very few which offers 1 TB of space below 60k.

I have been using it for more then 3 months and I am very happy with the performance.
Note that my other machine is a macbook pro M3, with 32 GB RAM.

Coding, movies, document editing, browsing, etc has no performance lags.
It is lightweight, battery life is good enough. Lasts 3+ hours easily.
I use Up/Down arrow keys a lot, and this laptop has the best sized keys.

The only drawback is the sound volume. It is not good enough. Though if you use headsets or external speakers, then no issues.

Display is okay.

It is a workhorse machine. No fancy features, but it has everything to get your work done.; Use after one week I am writing this review. Great laptop at average cost, lightweight, performance is good, also laptop body is good and slim in 15.6 inch.; This Acer inspire lite model (i5 11th gen) is a great value for money product. It has sp many spec like 16 GB ram (expandable) , 512 GB SSD (expandable), intel i5 11th gen processor. A laptop with all these specs cost more than 50k (you can compare it with other brands like HP, LENOVA, DELL, etc - you'll find that this laptop is the option under 40k with all these specs.
I have been using this laptop from last 5 days and I am really happy with the laptop's quality.

Pros:
- Great build quality (Metal alloy body)
- Good processor (i5 11th gen)
- FHD screen
- budget friendly
-180¬∞ hinge
- dual storage capable (SSD + HDD)
- Good battery backup
- C type port

Cons:
- No backlight keyboard
- No Camera privacy shutter
- Okish Sound quality

Great for students and working professionals with normal to medium level usage.
All in all it's a great product!; I had received the product on 5 Oct and found that power button not working on same day. Amazon promised inspection by agent in 48 hours, but the inspection happened only on 11 Oct that is 6 days. After the service engineer verified that the system is faulty, Amazon said they are to arrange a pick up in next 48 hours, that is by 13th. Today is 18th end of day, nobody has picked up despite repeated intimation. Now, I can't talk to Amazon helpline also, presumably they have blocked my number (?). So now I am stuck with a defective product, money held up with hostile Amazon. BTW, most service agents who attend calls in the day time are rude as well. I suppose the combination of this vendor and Amazon does not work well.; Laptop is not upto my expectations with display, sound and usability.; It's working good. Looks cool and functioning well üíØ. Good one. But i feel like battery life is somewhat a issue; This is a good product for my requirement. I do a music production and a little bit of coding. Fabulous display, great battery life. Recommended if you are looking for a good laptop at decent price; Slim design, Light weight :less than 1.6 kg.

Firstly, I did notice mild electric current when the laptop is charging but it is only at metal surface which top of screen - i dont touch it anyway :)

Here is my feedback per feature:

Usage - i use this laptop atleast 3-4hours a day for productivity purposes - i dont play games and i mainly use it for programming

Build quality - The laptop looks great initially however after some time the usage marks on keyboard, touchpad appear quickly, the hinges which hold the screen could have been improved, the screen falls down if it at a certain angle and is not firm
Although it says metal body but feels plastic all over.

Keyboard - this full keyboard is missing one column in the number pad - usually the last column contains + - and enter key but they have omitted that here and it will take sometime to get used to. In short keyboard is not full. However overall it is ok to type to - there is ample space for wrist support.

Heat dissipation - the Fans are right at the bottom and they make a lot of noise when laptop is heated - you will need a cooling pad to keep this laptop cool and if you plan work on your lap wear insulated clothing - in short this laptop cant work on a lap :)

Fingerprint - it is new feature for me in laptop and it works sometimes and sometimes it doesnt

Video / Audio - No complaints.

Battery - With the apps which i run i get 1.5-2hours of backup easily however i assume this would go down eventually but i don't mind keeping it plugged in

Cost - I dont think this laptop is made for rough use - if taken enough care this would survive for years and this configuration at 31k is definitely value for money - similar configuration is minimum 10k more

Lastly, i will recommend this laptop for students and people like me who are on a budget; Display is good but hinge loose but ok and built quality looks average, keyboard is kind of low quality,looks sleek and weight less, with a poor battery life, Fan sounds noisy but speaker sound is good comparitively and also heating too much but liberation of heat via body and fan too poor.charging time is too bad but c type charger is provided and all the port are too tight ... the USB ports and hdmi port. A bit on slow side.It feels like a low quality product with good style and sleek look.This is my personal opinion on the device after using for a while buying it or not is all upto you.; The zebronic I7 model I purchased through Amazon and it worth me nearly half a lakh and they cheated me by giving the refurbished where the product keys are mis matched like @ is mis matched with apostrophy "" and few other keys are not working and using for 1p min it's burning like fire and the processer named high and it's very slow and says quick charging but very slow and the performance are nothing totally got cheated by Amazon because I trust Amazon and buy. They cheated me; Super performance with i7 ,display-10/10
Great build ,looks classy,best things is its with dolby ,I watched movie and sound effect is just awesome, while purchasing I had the fear being this is new brand ,was having 2nd thought too ,but after getting product..decision of buying this was rt..all i can say just go fr it.; Pros:-
i7-12gen
1tb ssd (SATA roughly 100 mbits/s speed)
16 gb ram
Zebronics motherboard
Cons :-
SSD , RAM - chinese brand not of well known brands,
Fingerprint Reader sometimes become unresponsive
SSD provided is of sata which is a joke in this price segment must have pci express rather than sata , ssd name is nmve but it does support high speed data transfer
Ram chinese brand
Of course battery the most worst thing of it non removable , 2 hrs backup for playing online videos and surfing internet , if you used heavy task 1 hr is max because fans are running , charging time is dreadful 3-4 hrs charging whether you use in background or not‚Ä¶..
Wifi 5- which means you dont get wifi 6 which is todays need and next gen support.
Usb C common platform for charging the device , if you use by chance in phone then no one is responsible

Final verdict:-
Price is high according to specs providers .
Build quality is below par.Display quality is below par.Ram is average.SSD is below par.
Go with other brands like MSI you will get better specs interms of connection dont get fooled here.; Best part of this laptop is performance and speed. You can do multitasking and Can edit videos. Photoshop is working very smooth and All editing software's are working excellent. webcam quality was pretty good.

Coming to drawbacks Battery was week. Draining very fast and to charge 100%, it is taking minimum of 4hrs. build quality of keyboard and complete edges of laptop was very poor. It wont seems work for long time.

Pros:
Performance
Value for money
High end software's working smoothly
webcam

cons:
Battery
Build quality
Keyboard; Hi this sai sundeep. I was sharing my happiness of purchasing budget friendly cost with high configurations. I am totally satisfied with design and performance thanks to zebronics team it's a great design with sound quality is to good with dolby support.; Just bought 3-daya back.. received in good condition... Performance very good for day today works. But lack many little little features which reputed brands like HP, Dell, Lenovo etc provide like backlit Keys, scroll on touch pad, better front camera/webcam , detachable battery, Microsoft Office etc. The only advantage is it's i7 processor with 16 GB RAM, 1TB ROM and economic cost. Battery back up 3-5 hrs depending on use... let's see after few months"

here are the pros and cons of this laptop
Pros:
1) 12th gen CPU 1240P, 12 cores/16 threads ( total 16 Virtual processors).
2) Total 2 NVMe slots, 1st slot is PCIe gen 4 NVMe supported, 2nd slot PCIe gen 3).
3) backlit keyboard
4) Thunderbolt 4 supported
5) NVidia RTX 2050 with this price is worth
6) Fingerprint scan is fast

Cons:
1) Battery backup is not upto mark(around 2.5 Hrs) and sound is ok
2)Display is just normal 60Hz 1080P
3) 8GB RAM is 4x2 ( not future proof)
4) out of 2 SSD slots only 1 PCIe 4
5) No SD/microsd slot
6) No mux switch; Expected more speed from Intel i7, screens not flexible to 180 degree, rest of all good; I purchased this laptop for Rs. 46,240 during the 2023 Great Indian Festival Sale. From my perspective, here are the pros and cons:

Pros:

1. Inclusion of an i5 processor within this price range.
2. The RTX-2050 provides excellent value for money.
3. It's a lightweight laptop.
4. Impressive overall performance.

Cons:

1. The build quality is primarily plastic.
2. The keyboard feedback is subpar.
3. Lack of a Type-C charger.
4. Sound quality is unsatisfactory.
5. The label and printed information on the laptop battery appear different, raising suspicions of whether the product may be refurbished.; Ok ok .my one i bought one its battery stopped working within 2 days, then i ordered it again thats mother board stopped working within 12 days,and i couldn't return it as amazon hives only 7 days replacement,so finally after months of requesting and calling, i decided to get it repaired.that they did very fast and currently its working well.; The laptop is good for this price point.
First Day review.
1) Noticed that in multi core performance mode the max cpu frequency was around 2.57Ghz. I think this might be some bios issue. Where as in single core mode cpu runs at its full clock speed (4.1Ghz).
2) The laptop fan has zero noise at low load and when cpu runs at its high clock speed the noise is a bit loud (not very loud).
3) R23 cinebench single core :1657
multi core : 6200
4)Speakers and battery backup are mediocre.
5) Ram 4+4 GB ok dual channel, better than single 8 GB but problem upgrading wise.

After 3 days ( installing windows updates and drivers)
1) cinebench multicore test : 8500 pts.
2) single core : 1650 pts
3) Battery backup increased to 4-5 hrs. (good battery life)
4)Thermals are outstanding max 75¬∞C (during 4-5 hr stretch)
5) Loving this laptop so far.; Cpu 12th gen i5 with 12 core (8efficient+4high perf)
Nvidia rtx series gddr6 4gb gpu perfect mid ranger
Storage is Western digitals brand fitted
Panasonic 3cell 50whr battery
Wifi and bt is Intel
Audio is realtek
Ethernet is Atheros branded.
Thunderbolt 4 type USB c 3.2 generation 4
Usb 3.2 pen drive if connected it can transfer upto 1gb/s copy speed. I tested.
Windows 11 optimum speed and battery balanced as compared to 10. So this pc is good
I bought for 47k,
Adapter 90w medium speed charging...0-100 in 1hour 20mins around..battery is good capacity unlike other brands don't give 50ah, others have 30-40 only
First I compared with Lenovo, it has 11th gen only cpu, also gpu nvidia GTX only. So this pc same price they provide...so this acer is very discounted price brand.

Only negative is touch pad not soo fast..it slow..but works...better use external mouse...perfect...

Every laptop has pros and cons.. this laptop touch pad little low sensitivity...little over heat only..because gpu is there when we play games...

If you are not a gamer, laptop is heavy, big and not easy to carry. It also do not have a fingerprint reader( Weirdly my first laptop without one apart from my first Toshiba from 2013).
Battery life is really bad
I also was not able to extend the warranty for the product from my acer app
Good
good screen, fast processor, customizable keyboard and fan.; Best at this price range for sure no lag while gaming sare game chala diye most of the big games like gta 5 , froza horizon 5, sab smoothly run krta hai ache graphics main ‚úÖ updates ke baad battery jaldi drain hoti hai but kuch din main it adapts wapas back to normal ho jata hai; This laptop is literally the best laptop u could buy if you're on a budget. I got this for 70k and the price to performance is the best. The processor competes with Intel core i5 12th and the DDR 5 RAM really helps in gaming. I would genuinely recommend this laptop if ur budget is 70 - 80k

Note : Always buy the 16 GB RAM variant bcz come on it 2024, u atleast need 16 GB RAM for best gaming performance.; The laptop crashes randomly, the battery drains very fast. Even with normal tasks the battery drains in 1.5 hours. Total waste of money; Excellent product, I brought AMD Version so battery exceed my expectations.. Display color could have been more better...
RTX 3050 gaming performance is really great

16GB DdR5 ram but even though laptop has 2 slots I got one 16GB STICK only..

Fans has slight noice, when it's run in full speed

Overall if you don't have problem with display color,you can go for it; Here is honest review you might be looking for
Like this laptop is must buy laptop under 62k
Good thermals
Beast performance
4-5 hours backup while doing smalls tasks
2-3 while gaming
Sturdy build quality
Good keyboard with RGB
DISPLAY Is just amazing
Only cons of the laptop is it's doesn't come with lifetime MS office; Best laptop in budget, i got RYZEN 7 7735HS 16 GB in 65740‚Çπ and in this budget, this laptop is out standing in specs it provides. Acer Nitro Sense is quite very amazing and manges heating issues properly, i have played many games like GTA 5, Froza Horizon, and Call Of Duty, this laptop never disappointed me...
At last if you get this machine under 70k go for it.. its really worth buying."

Initially, it was not powering up. Battery was dead, but charging it brought it back to life. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have much time to explore it because it had other issues as well‚Äîspecifically, the display was faulty.
I promptly complained to Amazon, and the situation escalated from there:

On May 15th -
no one from Amazon or pick up service showed up and the scheduled pickup was canceled citing verification failure .
After contacting customer service, they assured me it wasn‚Äôt a major issue and rescheduled the pickup while registering a complaint against the pickup service.

The next pickup date was May 17th-
but once again, no one came to pick up the laptop. Surprisingly, I received a notification stating that the pickup was denied by the customer, which never happened.

On May 20th, the same scenario repeated, and a new pickup date was assigned.

Unfortunately, on May 21st, no pickup occurred because no one showed up.

Now, despite all these events, the customer service team claims that internal checks reveal the pickup was denied by me, and they won‚Äôt take any further action since the product was deemed to be in good condition.""; ; Liked It; Worst service by Amazon got defective piece can‚Äôt return or replace just get repair only misbehaving technician named Aditya something got help by dell so highly recommended not to buy from online; Facing Heating Issues
Battery Backup is also poor
Power adapter is not fitting into normal socket needs Refrigerator/AC power socket to charge
Worst part is Amazon not returning it without visiting Dell Service Center and letter that they can't solve your issue, which is not going to happen.
So Please be aware of it before you purchase it; I have received laptop without user manual. Also screen is flickering. Please return this laptop as i am sure it is refurbished product; Extreme Over heating problem, irritating fan noise on very second day of purchase.; Laptop physically very good no doubt. Performance every thing is good but the main draw back is battery life is only 1hrs. If you have to use this laptop you have use with charging this is not travel friendly laptop"

CPU is low-power series within i5 (1240p). As a result, it doesn't perform as snappily as 12400h, which consumes far more power, and will deplete your battery faster. But overall, it's acceptable, it won't blow you away.
The GPU is the only ampere class gpu in the 2000 series, and performs decently. Almost mid-range performance.
RAM is DDR4. If you really have the budget, go for a model with DDR5 and higher clock (4800 MHz) RAM. These days, the bottleneck in performance is at the RAM level.
But for Rs 46k (after offers) in Diwali 2023, this one was the cheapest laptop with a discrete GPU and a 12th or 13th Gen processor.; Acer Aspire 5 cons: 1) Not that fast
2) Very low speaker sound
3) Games run on 35-40 fps max thats all you get
4) Nvidia Graphic card is only 15watts
5) No usb type c slot
6) No DVD writer ( you dont need it in 2023)
7) Cannot add normal SSD or HDD
8) Very high power consumption
9) 4GB graphics memory insufficient to run even 2012 games (EG: GTA5 needs 6gb atleast for good qualilty., rest of the games post 2023 need atleast 12 GB graphics memory)
10) Insufficient cooling vents. Only one vent on the right top of the laptop below the screen.
11) Gets very hot not suitable to place on lap or it will burn your skin.

Pros: 1) Decent Screen quality and size
2) 3 usb slots( 2 on left and one on right) + Thunderbolt slot +lan cable slot + HDMI slot + 3.5mm headphone jack included
3) Decent for video and audio editing
4) Not made for hardcore gamers or graphic editing
5) Battery is 1.3 hours backup
6) HD webcam included
7) Mouse trackpad is good and it has fingerprint reader on the left of trackpad
8) Wifi 6E (Removable adapter inside the laptop)
9) 256GB NVME SSD included. ( one additional slot for NVME ssd)
10) 12th gen intel i5 cpu very good. 12 core cpu.
11) 4 GB graphics memory NVIDIA with cuda cores.
12) 16 Gb ram included very fast
13) Backlight keyboard only white light
14) Drivers readily available online on intel and Acer websites
15) Supports bluetooth mics headphones all for online meetings even usb heaphones supported. But bluetooth mic should be of good quality.
16) Runs hot during gaming.
17) Medium weight laptop and a bit thick.
18) Aluminium frame. Does leak a bit of current on the top of laptop when you touch it. It can be solved with proper earthing wire.
19) Suggested to buy another keyboard and mouse so that you dont damage its keyboard inbuilt.
20) Supports windows 11 home. Windows 11 pro can be bought on microsoft store if you want encryption of drives.(Bitlocker)
21) 1080p resolution lcd screen.

I think there are better laptops out there in this price range. I only bought this laptop for wifi 6E and backlight keyboard. Better get a touch screen LED type for battery savings and dont pay for windows 11 pro. If possible get a DOS laptop and purchase windows 10 home.

For gaming i wont recommend, it only has 4gb ddr4 graphics memory which is too low in todays standards.

The bios does not have fan speed or voltage control options.

Booting speed is good. Boots under 5 seconds.; So first of all I wanna say I'm writing this review after a use of almost a month and this will be a long but so beneficial for everyone.

So far I'm happy with the product as I realised that this is not a top level gaming like Asus tuf but actually its far better than Asus Tuf Gaming or other gaming laptops in this price range because this purpose is actually for people who don't do much of gaming and do other tasks, though even if you do so play whatever you want it will give you 60 fps in forza horizon 5 at 720p so the heaviest game is going smooth and so on for hours probably we can say its actually for gaming purpose with a look of non gaming laptops so some may find it fascinating and some may not because if you're a student so more likely people will surely mock you if they see using gaming laptop even if you don't do any gaming and study only but we know relatives,, let's get back to topic so as per now its clear that performance is top notch and now it comes on video playback like what is the highest quality you can watch videos on YouTube so first of all to do that I would like to inform that you must first do some setups like turning on GPU and then doing other settings like always optimize for quality and performance and you also have to do it for Forza Horizon 5 if you wants 60fps in 720p otherwise if its turned off then you'll get upset so must turn on GPU as its off by default so turn it on then enjoy so after turning on you are actually able to play 8K videos on YouTube without any lag so that's such an amazing thing because people sometimes are confused regarding will it give you 4K quality or not and here it's giving you 8K quality on YouTube but it is a thing to be noted like most of the content of YouTube is actually 1080p content especially all series and movies so obviously this 8K video streaming is good but not a reason for one should buy this so what's the reason?? Absolutely the performance which is outstanding though that doesn't mean we should ignore this 8K superiority as this shows the capability of this amazing tech and the graphic card RTX2050 have good fans so that's also good for keeping it little cool so not much heating problem and build quality is amazing and due to being aluminium while plugged in you may feel some slight shocks which is like a vibration so don't be worried at all its just ok as its back cover is of aluminium so don't Worry of it as no big shocks it just feels like a vibration so don't worry next thing is the battery backup after you turn it on to the performance mode then battery last upto almost 3 hours on slight usage if you do gaming you can see how fast it drains so don't do gaming while its not plugged in so overall this is all good and it may look suspicious as why there ain't any cons in this laptop so don't worry here are CONS:

First of all and always note that this laptop is not for gaming if you do gaming then absolutely its not for you not at all

It doesn't come with MS office so those who use ms office a lot so please stay away from this because you'll have to pay extra money for MS office but the question does it worth it to purchase ms office? So the answer is depends upon how you wanna use like slight gaming, multimedia etc. Then ofcourse this is worth it and if not then no don't go for it

No free features üò≠ you gotta buy everything so man!! That can make it costly if you use Adobe, MS office, and any other paid subscription app because no matter what just pay!! So again does it worth to be pay so much after purchasing it so that depends on you because you know what you want so here in this case you have to check though it works best and overall performance is good but does it require all that thing well upto you!!

Perhaps for people who do other things especially study and believe this is actually for students because students do slight gaming and other things so for students nothing is better than this though profesinalist can also use because I can say its worth it as I've used because its very easy to use and everything so clean so just now upto you

I just hope this long review could help someone; Attention to anyone considering buying this laptop! Let me recount my experience: I purchased an Acer laptop and used it for about a month without any issues. However, it started overheating and the battery was draining rapidly. On November 18, 2023, the laptop abruptly shut down. I contacted the service center immediately, and on November 21, an engineer came to inspect the laptop. They identified a damaged motherboard and said it needed replacement, estimating a 2 to 3-day wait. After returning on November 28 with a new motherboard, they attempted to install it, but the laptop failed to start. The engineer suspected another issue with the replacement motherboard, necessitating another service request and an additional 3 to 4-day wait. As of December 5, the laptop remains unrepaired. This experience has been frustrating, considering the purpose for which I bought the laptop. I'm sharing this to shed light on the situation for everyone's awareness.""

Coding, movies, document editing, browsing, etc has no performance lags.
It is lightweight, battery life is good enough. Lasts 3+ hours easily.
I use Up/Down arrow keys a lot, and this laptop has the best sized keys.

Display is okay.

It is a workhorse machine. No fancy features, but it has everything to get your work done.; Use after one week I am writing this review. Great laptop at average cost, lightweight, performance is good, also laptop body is good and slim in 15.6 inch.; This Acer inspire lite model (i5 11th gen) is a great value for money product.

A laptop with all these specs cost more than 50k (you can compare it with other brands like HP, LENOVA, DELL, etc - you'll find that this laptop is the option under 40k with all these specs.
I have been using this laptop from last 5 days and I am really happy with the laptop's quality.

Pros:
- Great build quality (Metal alloy body)
- Good processor (i5 11th gen)
- FHD screen
- budget friendly
-180¬∞ hinge
- dual storage capable (SSD + HDD)
- Good battery backup
- C type port

Cons:
- No backlight keyboard
- No Camera privacy shutter
- Okish Sound quality

Great for students and working professionals with normal to medium level usage.
All in all it's a great product!; I had received the product on 5 Oct and found that power button not working on same day. Amazon promised inspection by agent in 48 hours, but the inspection happened only on 11 Oct that is 6 days. After the service engineer verified that the system is faulty, Amazon said they are to arrange a pick up in next 48 hours, that is by 13th. Today is 18th end of day, nobody has picked up despite repeated intimation. Now, I can't talk to Amazon helpline also, presumably they have blocked my number (?). So now I am stuck with a defective product, money held up with hostile Amazon. BTW, most service agents who attend calls in the day time are rude as well. I suppose the combination of this vendor and Amazon does not work well.; Laptop is not upto my expectations with display, sound and usability.; It's working good. Looks cool and functioning well üíØ. Good one. But i feel like battery life is somewhat a issue; This is a good product for my requirement. I do a music production and a little bit of coding. Fabulous display, great battery life. Recommended if you are looking for a good laptop at decent price; Slim design, Light weight :less than 1.6 kg.

Build quality - The laptop looks great initially however after some time the usage marks on keyboard, touchpad appear quickly, the hinges which hold the screen could have been improved, the screen falls down if it at a certain angle and is not firm
Although it says metal body but feels plastic all over.

Keyboard - this full keyboard is missing one column in the number pad - usually the last column contains + - and enter key but they have omitted that here and it will take sometime to get used to. In short keyboard is not full. However overall it is ok to type to - there is ample space for wrist support.

Heat dissipation - the Fans are right at the bottom and they make a lot of noise when laptop is heated - you will need a cooling pad to keep this laptop cool and if you plan work on your lap wear insulated clothing - in short this laptop cant work on a lap :)

Fingerprint - it is new feature for me in laptop and it works sometimes and sometimes it doesnt

Video / Audio - No complaints.

Battery - With the apps which i run i get 1.5-2hours of backup easily however i assume this would go down eventually but i don't mind keeping it plugged in

Cost - I dont think this laptop is made for rough use - if taken enough care this would survive for years and this configuration at 31k is definitely value for money - similar configuration is minimum 10k more

Lastly, i will recommend this laptop for students and people like me who are on a budget; Display is good but hinge loose but ok and built quality looks average, keyboard is kind of low quality,looks sleek and weight less, with a poor battery life, Fan sounds noisy but speaker sound is good comparitively and also heating too much but liberation of heat via body and fan too poor.charging time is too bad but c type charger is provided and all the port are too tight ... the USB ports and hdmi port. A bit on slow side.It feels like a low quality product with good style and sleek look.This is my personal opinion on the device after using for a while buying it or not is all upto you.; The zebronic I7 model I purchased through Amazon and it worth me nearly half a lakh and they cheated me by giving the refurbished where the product keys are mis matched like @ is mis matched with apostrophy "" and few other keys are not working and using for 1p min it's burning like fire and the processer named high and it's very slow and says quick charging but very slow and the performance are nothing totally got cheated by Amazon because I trust Amazon and buy. They cheated me; Super performance with i7 ,display-10/10
Great build ,looks classy,best things is its with dolby ,I watched movie and sound effect is just awesome, while purchasing I had the fear being this is new brand ,was having 2nd thought too ,but after getting product..decision of buying this was rt..all i can say just go fr it.; Pros:-
i7-12gen
1tb ssd (SATA roughly 100 mbits/s speed)
16 gb ram
Zebronics motherboard
Cons :-
SSD , RAM - chinese brand not of well known brands,
Fingerprint Reader sometimes become unresponsive
SSD provided is of sata which is a joke in this price segment must have pci express rather than sata , ssd name is nmve but it does support high speed data transfer
Ram chinese brand
Of course battery the most worst thing of it non removable , 2 hrs backup for playing online videos and surfing internet , if you used heavy task 1 hr is max because fans are running , charging time is dreadful 3-4 hrs charging whether you use in background or not‚Ä¶..
Wifi 5- which means you dont get wifi 6 which is todays need and next gen support.
Usb C common platform for charging the device , if you use by chance in phone then no one is responsible

Final verdict:-
Price is high according to specs providers .
Build quality is below par.Display quality is below par.Ram is average.SSD is below par.
Go with other brands like MSI you will get better specs interms of connection dont get fooled here.; Best part of this laptop is performance and speed. You can do multitasking and Can edit videos. Photoshop is working very smooth and All editing software's are working excellent. webcam quality was pretty good.

Coming to drawbacks Battery was week. Draining very fast and to charge 100%, it is taking minimum of 4hrs. build quality of keyboard and complete edges of laptop was very poor. It wont seems work for long time.

Pros:
Performance
Value for money
High end software's working smoothly
webcam

cons:
Battery
Build quality
Keyboard; Hi this sai sundeep. I was sharing my happiness of purchasing budget friendly cost with high configurations. I am totally satisfied with design and performance thanks to zebronics team it's a great design with sound quality is to good with dolby support.; Just bought 3-daya back.. received in good condition... Performance very good for day today works. But lack many little little features which reputed brands like HP, Dell, Lenovo etc provide like backlit Keys, scroll on touch pad, better front camera/webcam , detachable battery, Microsoft Office etc. The only advantage is it's i7 processor with 16 GB RAM, 1TB ROM and economic cost. Battery back up 3-5 hrs depending on use... let's see after few months"

I won't recommend this laptop for dedicated gaming tho; ; I boght this laptop for mainly multitasking and virtualization purpose, 16GB version was not available so bought 8 GB version(4x2), then I upgraded it to 32 GB crucial RAM, overall super performance and smooth no lags, installed linux alongside windows, NVMe PCIe gen 3 SSD provided and speed is also good see the speedtest image attached, I bought it for around Rs 52K after bank discount and old laptop exchange offer

here are the pros and cons of this laptop
Pros:
1) 12th gen CPU 1240P, 12 cores/16 threads ( total 16 Virtual processors).
2) Total 2 NVMe slots, 1st slot is PCIe gen 4 NVMe supported, 2nd slot PCIe gen 3).
3) backlit keyboard
4) Thunderbolt 4 supported
5) NVidia RTX 2050 with this price is worth
6) Fingerprint scan is fast

Cons:
1) Battery backup is not upto mark(around 2.5 Hrs) and sound is ok
2)Display is just normal 60Hz 1080P
3) 8GB RAM is 4x2 ( not future proof)
4) out of 2 SSD slots only 1 PCIe 4
5) No SD/microsd slot
6) No mux switch; Expected more speed from Intel i7, screens not flexible to 180 degree, rest of all good; I purchased this laptop for Rs. 46,240 during the 2023 Great Indian Festival Sale. From my perspective, here are the pros and cons:

Pros:

1. Inclusion of an i5 processor within this price range.
2. The RTX-2050 provides excellent value for money.
3. It's a lightweight laptop.
4. Impressive overall performance.

Cons:

1. The build quality is primarily plastic.
2. The keyboard feedback is subpar.
3. Lack of a Type-C charger.
4. Sound quality is unsatisfactory.
5. The label and printed information on the laptop battery appear different, raising suspicions of whether the product may be refurbished.; Ok ok .my one i bought one its battery stopped working within 2 days, then i ordered it again thats mother board stopped working within 12 days,and i couldn't return it as amazon hives only 7 days replacement,so finally after months of requesting and calling, i decided to get it repaired.that they did very fast and currently its working well.; The laptop is good for this price point.
First Day review.
1) Noticed that in multi core performance mode the max cpu frequency was around 2.57Ghz. I think this might be some bios issue. Where as in single core mode cpu runs at its full clock speed (4.1Ghz).
2) The laptop fan has zero noise at low load and when cpu runs at its high clock speed the noise is a bit loud (not very loud).
3) R23 cinebench single core :1657
multi core : 6200
4)Speakers and battery backup are mediocre.
5) Ram 4+4 GB ok dual channel, better than single 8 GB but problem upgrading wise.

After 3 days ( installing windows updates and drivers)
1) cinebench multicore test : 8500 pts.
2) single core : 1650 pts
3) Battery backup increased to 4-5 hrs. (good battery life)
4)Thermals are outstanding max 75¬∞C (during 4-5 hr stretch)
5) Loving this laptop so far.; Cpu 12th gen i5 with 12 core (8efficient+4high perf)
Nvidia rtx series gddr6 4gb gpu perfect mid ranger
Storage is Western digitals brand fitted
Panasonic 3cell 50whr battery
Wifi and bt is Intel
Audio is realtek
Ethernet is Atheros branded.
Thunderbolt 4 type USB c 3.2 generation 4
Usb 3.2 pen drive if connected it can transfer upto 1gb/s copy speed. I tested.
Windows 11 optimum speed and battery balanced as compared to 10. So this pc is good
I bought for 47k,
Adapter 90w medium speed charging...0-100 in 1hour 20mins around..battery is good capacity unlike other brands don't give 50ah, others have 30-40 only
First I compared with Lenovo, it has 11th gen only cpu, also gpu nvidia GTX only. So this pc same price they provide...so this acer is very discounted price brand.

Only negative is touch pad not soo fast..it slow..but works...better use external mouse...perfect...

Every laptop has pros and cons.. this laptop touch pad little low sensitivity...little over heat only..because gpu is there when we play games...
If you are expert go for this GPU pc, otherwise go for non GPU pc"

If you are not a gamer, laptop is heavy, big and not easy to carry. It also do not have a fingerprint reader( Weirdly my first laptop without one apart from my first Toshiba from 2013).
Battery life is really bad
I also was not able to extend the warranty for the product from my acer app
Good
good screen, fast processor, customizable keyboard and fan.; Best at this price range for sure no lag while gaming sare game chala diye most of the big games like gta 5 , froza horizon 5, sab smoothly run krta hai ache graphics main ‚úÖ updates ke baad battery jaldi drain hoti hai but kuch din main it adapts wapas back to normal ho jata hai; This laptop is literally the best laptop u could buy if you're on a budget. I got this for 70k and the price to performance is the best. The processor competes with Intel core i5 12th and the DDR 5 RAM really helps in gaming. I would genuinely recommend this laptop if ur budget is 70 - 80k

Note : Always buy the 16 GB RAM variant bcz come on it 2024, u atleast need 16 GB RAM for best gaming performance.; The laptop crashes randomly, the battery drains very fast. Even with normal tasks the battery drains in 1.5 hours. Total waste of money; Excellent product, I brought AMD Version so battery exceed my expectations.. Display color could have been more better...
RTX 3050 gaming performance is really great

16GB DdR5 ram but even though laptop has 2 slots I got one 16GB STICK only..

Fans has slight noice, when it's run in full speed

Overall if you don't have problem with display color,you can go for it; Here is honest review you might be looking for
Like this laptop is must buy laptop under 62k
Good thermals
Beast performance
4-5 hours backup while doing smalls tasks
2-3 while gaming
Sturdy build quality
Good keyboard with RGB
DISPLAY Is just amazing
Only cons of the laptop is it's doesn't come with lifetime MS office; Best laptop in budget, i got RYZEN 7 7735HS 16 GB in 65740‚Çπ and in this budget, this laptop is out standing in specs it provides. Acer Nitro Sense is quite very amazing and manges heating issues properly, i have played many games like GTA 5, Froza Horizon, and Call Of Duty, this laptop never disappointed me...
At last if you get this machine under 70k go for it.. its really worth buying."

Initially, it was not powering up. Battery was dead, but charging it brought it back to life. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have much time to explore it because it had other issues as well‚Äîspecifically, the display was faulty.
I promptly complained to Amazon, and the situation escalated from there:

On May 15th -
no one from Amazon or pick up service showed up and the scheduled pickup was canceled citing verification failure .
After contacting customer service, they assured me it wasn‚Äôt a major issue and rescheduled the pickup while registering a complaint against the pickup service.

The next pickup date was May 17th-
but once again, no one came to pick up the laptop. Surprisingly, I received a notification stating that the pickup was denied by the customer, which never happened.

On May 20th, the same scenario repeated, and a new pickup date was assigned.

Unfortunately, on May 21st, no pickup occurred because no one showed up.

Now, despite all these events, the customer service team claims that internal checks reveal the pickup was denied by me, and they won‚Äôt take any further action since the product was deemed to be in good condition.""; ; Liked It; Worst service by Amazon got defective piece can‚Äôt return or replace just get repair only misbehaving technician named Aditya something got help by dell so highly recommended not to buy from online; Facing Heating Issues
Battery Backup is also poor
Power adapter is not fitting into normal socket needs Refrigerator/AC power socket to charge
Worst part is Amazon not returning it without visiting Dell Service Center and letter that they can't solve your issue, which is not going to happen.
So Please be aware of it before you purchase it; I have received laptop without user manual. Also screen is flickering. Please return this laptop as i am sure it is refurbished product; Extreme Over heating problem, irritating fan noise on very second day of purchase.; Laptop physically very good no doubt. Performance every thing is good but the main draw back is battery life is only 1hrs. If you have to use this laptop you have use with charging this is not travel friendly laptop"
