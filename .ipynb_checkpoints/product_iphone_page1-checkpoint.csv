You can see who’s calling, track your next ride, check your flight status, and so much more.; INNOVATIVE DESIGN — iPhone 15 features a durable color-infused glass and aluminum design. It’s splash, water, and dust resistant. The Ceramic Shield front is tougher than any smartphone glass. And the 6.1"" Super Retina XDR display is up to 2x brighter in the sun compared to iPhone 14.; 48MP MAIN CAMERA WITH 2X TELEPHOTO — The 48MP Main camera shoots in super-high resolution. So it’s easier than ever to take standout photos with amazing detail. The 2x optical-quality Telephoto lets you frame the perfect close-up.; NEXT-GENERATION PORTRAITS — Capture portraits with dramatically more detail and color. Just tap to shift the focus between subjects — even after you take the shot.; POWERHOUSE A16 BIONIC CHIP — The superfast chip powers advanced features like computational photography, fluid Dynamic Island transitions, and Voice Isolation for phone calls. And A16 Bionic is incredibly efficient to help deliver great all-day battery life.","Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of use

Pros
- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants
- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here
- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless
- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA
- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome
- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.
- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone
- Apples approach on Security!
- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawless

Cons
- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm
- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchases

Industry memes
- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much
- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!
- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?
- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for texting

Tips of managing battery health
- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh
- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up
- I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging
- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%
- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service
- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section
- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc
- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending above

Vendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.

….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience; Design
One of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14.

Display
The iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.

Performance
The iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.

Camera
The iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.

Battery life
The iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14. This means that you can expect to get around a day of use on a single charge. Overall The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade over the iPhone 14.

Pros
New design with rounded edges
More powerful A16 Bionic chip found in 14 pro
New 48-megapixel main camera
Brighter display with upto 2000 nits brightness
USB C can be used for anything
Dynamic Island

Cons
No 120hz display
No Macro photography; Amazing phone, great touch sensitivity; Delivery was satisfactorily
Product was good and safe; Very good battery, very good camera, sound quality is also good. Overall performance is excellent.; At starting am hesitating to buy this much costly phone as I am android user and mostly I used android phones below 20k so am not able to take decision to buy or not but I purchased and now am very happy and not getting feeling like why I spend almost 80k for a phone because am enjoying ui interface and many iPhone functions and feel I didn’t purchase this brand for show off actually am big fan of Steve jobs and I like apple products so overall experience about this phone is awesome and am not getting any regret feeling camera is very good , battery backup also good ,user interface is awesome; Excellent product. The main concern is while charging the mobile is going too hot. If you touch the mobile whole body is too heating.; Sound quality is very good. Performance is good and transfer of data from my old iPhone happened very fast. Software update was completed immediately after starting the phone . Only problem is that the charging cable is different and it doesn’t fit into USB port, so one must have an adapter or order one along with the iPhone."

Pros
- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants
- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here
- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless
- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA
- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome

- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone

Apple phone without a second delay, I would say it is better than all android phones I have used. The phone is like water, it flows in a way you want and shaping in your way. In a best way possible, the phone is designed to only show what the user wants and eliminating unnecessary ads, features that I have seen in android.

Why it is better than Android?
You pay too much money for Apple products, obviously you experience the features, physical components , camera lens etc. Apart from basic things, you can also enjoy the best applications available in app store. If you are a developer you might know the app store policy for application publish and their security posture towards handling payment apps etc. They publish best application and the way the apps, its modules switches is just flawless. Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +1 respect for apple to show such concern with user.

Apple phones are same ? like 13 vs 14
The reason 14 is same as 13 may be business practice followed from 11th edition. But please note that iPhone making changes internally like physical components (small change in battery performance, lens in 14 edition), additional features but that may not satisfy you to buy 14 edition. If you do not find ""the very few changes"" interesting in 14, go for 13. Because physical and even cameras are not visually very much different in 13 vs 14 comparison. Also you get 13 for cheap :)
14 is just added features but that is not for daily use, the features real time use is rare case. But the best part is there is no extra cost between 13 vs 14 prices (except extra 10k slash)

Concern you must have.
Apple is not giving chargers and their silicon cases are very expensive (but very good in touch and scratch friendly in back due to silk layer). This is an issue for sure. You have to buy charger not coming with USB C and claiming that you help carbon footprint, understandable but not customer friendly business model. Even after the purchase I had to spend at least 7k for charger and case.

Apple care.
I am not buying it, I pay for phone which is already expensive for this premium and apple care does have strict policy that if you understand that is waste. Instead I find a private insurance to make things better.; Genuine apple product, delivered as promised by Amazon. It’s total paisa vasool. Being an iPhone you can go for it with total peace of mind. Excellent camera both during day and night with a good battery life.; Positive:
Product looks good, batter life is good, picture quality is good.
Negative:
Lighting charger adapter is not included in the package.
Touch screen is not smooth as in other iPhone; Camera I like. Appearance also good. Value for money product; Iphone always high level; Great Product.; Everything is perfect. Doesn’t matter if it’s having 60Hz refresh rate. Very reliable battery, camera, iOS.; Do not get an iphone for now. Their software updates cause hardware issues like damaged display and camera. In my case the latest 17.5.1 update broke the flash and the so called apple senior advisers read scripts like a robot. The service centers do what they please and they wanted 32000 to fix my flash issue that happened due to their update. Also in service centre’s terms and conditions they can cause cosmetic damage and they will mot be responsible for that. It’s mentioned in their repair terms and agreements."

Performance is good and transfer of data from my old iPhone happened very fast. Software update was completed immediately after starting the phone . Only problem is that the charging cable is different and it doesn’t fit into USB port, so one must have an adapter or order one along with the iPhone."

I got bored to android and wanted some change so switched to iPhone. Redmi phones otherwise are awesome too.😊

Following are my experiences based on 8 days usage:
- Battery backup is very good.
Scenario 1:
I got 3 days of backup with light usage(picking up the calls, replying whatsapp, 30 minutes of gameplay (genshin impact). For 1 and half days, my phone was on battery saver mode. For the rest of duration it was on normal mode.
Scenario 2: Only on normal mode with moderate usage it gives 2 days of backup with light usage.
- Performance is awesome. Everything is buttery smooth from apps to games.
- Latest ios 17 is good as well. I didnt felt much problems while switching from android to iphone. Many things are improved.
- You can remove most of the inbuilt apple apps with ios 17.

Things i love about iPhone over android (redmi phones):
- flawless performance especially for gaming. No android can offer this level of smoothness.
- excellent and all rounder camera.
- more battery backup compared to any android

Things i love about android over iPhone:
- android is more flexible than ios. e.g you can’t select all emails in gmail app in iphone. You cant close all background running apps in one shot like we do it in android.
- apps are way better in terms of usability.
- i personally found that ios has more bugs than android ( which can be felt by a common user). E.g. keyboard sound suddenly increases, not able to receive a call sometimes. Apple do resolve these in their updates but for a phone which costs this much it’s embarrassing.
- cheap cost compared to iphone. People usually go for iphone when they get bored from android (my case) or to be a status symbol or who needs reliable phone for long run. But the things have changed now. Even android offers long term support now and they are bit cheaper compared to iphone giving you more features and usability.

Final verdict: iphone is allrounder phone in my opinion. Great camera, great performance, great battery life, great cost too😁. So if you need a change definitely go for it. Its a great phone.; Charging is fast till 80% , battery backup is good , feels premium and good in hand; The great mobile with amazing features, build quality is so good, amazing camera with stunning pictures. Good battery life,good performance.; ; Battery backup verry good Amazing project Thanks Amazon"

Apple phone without a second delay, I would say it is better than all android phones I have used. The phone is like water, it flows in a way you want and shaping in your way. In a best way possible, the phone is designed to only show what the user wants and eliminating unnecessary ads, features that I have seen in android.

Why it is better than Android?
You pay too much money for Apple products, obviously you experience the features, physical components , camera lens etc. Apart from basic things, you can also enjoy the best applications available in app store. If you are a developer you might know the app store policy for application publish and their security posture towards handling payment apps etc. They publish best application and the way the apps, its modules switches is just flawless. Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +1 respect for apple to show such concern with user.

Apple phones are same ? like 13 vs 14
The reason 14 is same as 13 may be business practice followed from 11th edition. But please note that iPhone making changes internally like physical components (small change in battery performance, lens in 14 edition), additional features but that may not satisfy you to buy 14 edition. If you do not find ""the very few changes"" interesting in 14, go for 13. Because physical and even cameras are not visually very much different in 13 vs 14 comparison. Also you get 13 for cheap :)
14 is just added features but that is not for daily use, the features real time use is rare case. But the best part is there is no extra cost between 13 vs 14 prices (except extra 10k slash)

Concern you must have.
Apple is not giving chargers and their silicon cases are very expensive (but very good in touch and scratch friendly in back due to silk layer). This is an issue for sure. You have to buy charger not coming with USB C and claiming that you help carbon footprint, understandable but not customer friendly business model. Even after the purchase I had to spend at least 7k for charger and case.

Apple care.
I am not buying it, I pay for phone which is already expensive for this premium and apple care does have strict policy that if you understand that is waste. Instead I find a private insurance to make things better.; Genuine apple product, delivered as promised by Amazon. It’s total paisa vasool. Being an iPhone you can go for it with total peace of mind. Excellent camera both during day and night with a good battery life.; Positive:
Product looks good, batter life is good, picture quality is good.
Negative:
Lighting charger adapter is not included in the package.
Touch screen is not smooth as in other iPhone; Camera I like. Appearance also good. Value for money product; Iphone always high level; Great Product.; Everything is perfect. Doesn’t matter if it’s having 60Hz refresh rate. Very reliable battery, camera, iOS.; Do not get an iphone for now. Their software updates cause hardware issues like damaged display and camera. In my case the latest 17.5.1 update broke the flash and the so called apple senior advisers read scripts like a robot. The service centers do what they please and they wanted 32000 to fix my flash issue that happened due to their update. Also in service centre’s terms and conditions they can cause cosmetic damage and they will mot be responsible for that. It’s mentioned in their repair terms and agreements."

Apple phone without a second delay, I would say it is better than all android phones I have used. The phone is like water, it flows in a way you want and shaping in your way. In a best way possible, the phone is designed to only show what the user wants and eliminating unnecessary ads, features that I have seen in android.

Why it is better than Android?
You pay too much money for Apple products, obviously you experience the features, physical components , camera lens etc. Apart from basic things, you can also enjoy the best applications available in app store. If you are a developer you might know the app store policy for application publish and their security posture towards handling payment apps etc. They publish best application and the way the apps, its modules switches is just flawless. Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +1 respect for apple to show such concern with user.

Apple phones are same ? like 13 vs 14
The reason 14 is same as 13 may be business practice followed from 11th edition. But please note that iPhone making changes internally like physical components (small change in battery performance, lens in 14 edition), additional features but that may not satisfy you to buy 14 edition. If you do not find ""the very few changes"" interesting in 14, go for 13. Because physical and even cameras are not visually very much different in 13 vs 14 comparison. Also you get 13 for cheap :)
14 is just added features but that is not for daily use, the features real time use is rare case. But the best part is there is no extra cost between 13 vs 14 prices (except extra 10k slash)

Concern you must have.
Apple is not giving chargers and their silicon cases are very expensive (but very good in touch and scratch friendly in back due to silk layer). This is an issue for sure. You have to buy charger not coming with USB C and claiming that you help carbon footprint, understandable but not customer friendly business model. Even after the purchase I had to spend at least 7k for charger and case.

Apple care.
I am not buying it, I pay for phone which is already expensive for this premium and apple care does have strict policy that if you understand that is waste. Instead I find a private insurance to make things better.; Genuine apple product, delivered as promised by Amazon. It’s total paisa vasool. Being an iPhone you can go for it with total peace of mind. Excellent camera both during day and night with a good battery life.; Positive:
Product looks good, batter life is good, picture quality is good.
Negative:
Lighting charger adapter is not included in the package.
Touch screen is not smooth as in other iPhone; Camera I like. Appearance also good. Value for money product; Iphone always high level; Great Product.; Everything is perfect. Doesn’t matter if it’s having 60Hz refresh rate. Very reliable battery, camera, iOS.; Do not get an iphone for now. Their software updates cause hardware issues like damaged display and camera. In my case the latest 17.5.1 update broke the flash and the so called apple senior advisers read scripts like a robot. The service centers do what they please and they wanted 32000 to fix my flash issue that happened due to their update. Also in service centre’s terms and conditions they can cause cosmetic damage and they will mot be responsible for that. It’s mentioned in their repair terms and agreements."

Pros
- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants
- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here
- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless
- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA
- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome
- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.
- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone
- Apples approach on Security!
- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawless

Cons
- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm
- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchases

Industry memes
- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much
- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!
- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?
- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for texting

Tips of managing battery health
- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh
- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up
- I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging
- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%
- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service
- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section
- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc
- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending above

Vendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.

….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience; Design
One of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14.

Display
The iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.

Performance
The iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.

Camera
The iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.

Battery life
The iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14. This means that you can expect to get around a day of use on a single charge. Overall The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade over the iPhone 14.

Pros
New design with rounded edges
More powerful A16 Bionic chip found in 14 pro
New 48-megapixel main camera
Brighter display with upto 2000 nits brightness
USB C can be used for anything
Dynamic Island

Cons
No 120hz display
No Macro photography; Amazing phone, great touch sensitivity; Delivery was satisfactorily
Product was good and safe; Very good battery, very good camera, sound quality is also good. Overall performance is excellent.; At starting am hesitating to buy this much costly phone as I am android user and mostly I used android phones below 20k so am not able to take decision to buy or not but I purchased and now am very happy and not getting feeling like why I spend almost 80k for a phone because am enjoying ui interface and many iPhone functions and feel I didn’t purchase this brand for show off actually am big fan of Steve jobs and I like apple products so overall experience about this phone is awesome and am not getting any regret feeling camera is very good , battery backup also good ,user interface is awesome; Excellent product. The main concern is while charging the mobile is going too hot. If you touch the mobile whole body is too heating.; Sound quality is very good. Performance is good and transfer of data from my old iPhone happened very fast. Software update was completed immediately after starting the phone . Only problem is that the charging cable is different and it doesn’t fit into USB port, so one must have an adapter or order one along with the iPhone."

I will also give some useful tips for its efficient usage
At the out set the price Rs one lakh rupees favorably compares with the MRP in European countries only. The phone comes with a fairly protruding camera. Hence I suggest using a flip case ( from left to right Fig 1 )or a good quality back case. It comes preinstalled with a protective screen. I suggest retaining it until it shows scratches.
Tips for setting. Use battery setting of “Balanced” Refresh rate of 60 Hz is more than adequate for smooth performance. I use DARK mode and a display resolution of 2400X1080. Draining battery using higher resolution is not worth it. It comes with a unique feature to edit the toggles. You can access toggles by swiping the screen top to bottom. At the bottom use “edit” and this allows for editing and moving the icons. See Fig 2. It is not straight forward to apply wallpapers of your choice. From the settings go to “Wallpaper and personalization. Then press “find more”. In Fig 3 I have shown the option to install your own choice. Press “my account” and will take you to your photo collection. You can choose between lock screen and home screen. I use LEICA vibrant display for camera setting. If you shake the phone, camera makes rattling noise. This is normal
I have been using the phone for the last 18 days. I will gives its positive and negative points
PROS:
Extremely well built phone with vegan leather back and aluminum frame. It gives firm grip and less prone to smudges. Outstanding camera engineered with LEICA SUMMILUX four lenses of different focal lengths of 50 MP. Unique feature is variable aperture from 1.63 to 4. In fig 4 see the depth of field of the flower bunch at aperture 4. Outstanding resolution in macro close-up. See Fig 5 individual flower. Fitted with 1 inch SONY LYT-900 sensor allowing plenty of light. The camera is by far the most versatile compared to any reputed flagship cellphones. Excellent display resolution of 1400X3200px. Very bright display up to 3000 nits.
CONS:
The phone is supplied with 90W charger and it becomes very warm during charging. Even while using 40W charger the becomes warm. I do not understand why the phone becomes warm while using the camera. This did not happen with Xiaomi 13 ultra. I did not shoot videos. This is not good. Users in temperate countries have reported fogging of lenses. I did not face this problem and users in India may not face this problem. Though rated 5000mAh the battery life even under settings that conserve battery is not good. XIAOMI give software support for only FOUR years. This is in contrast to several other phone manufacturers that give 7 years.
VERDICT. It will be hard to find a cellphone which can outperform Xiaomi 14 ultra camera and display. It functions very smoothly and a pleasure to use. It does provide a camera accessory kit at a cost of over Rs 17000 ($200) I used a similar kit on my Xiaomi 13 Ultra. It is not worth the price. In summary I HAVE NO HESITATION TO RECOMMEND XIAOMI 14 ULTRA.; I think it's a very good phone under 1 lakh
Touch quality is awesome,Great display,fingerprint work very fast
Camera quality is far better than iPhone
Very comfortable phone I love Xiaomi mobile
Performance is a beast.
If u love Xiaomi then go for it.awsome phone at this price.; Truly a ""Never have I ever"" moment for me as I was very sceptical in spending flagship money for a Xiaomi phone. It's been only couple of hours since I touched this. Still in honeymoon phase I believe. But here are few quick observations in first few hours -

What I am liking so far-

Haptics, display, Camera quality (without over-sharpening or iphone like flat processing), ergonomics (pretty good to hold despite the camera bump), smoothness of HyperOS, battery usage (only been few hours and seeing no red flags as of now)

What I am nitpicking about-

Phone came with pre installed netflix, facebook, phonepe, fitbit (uninstall-able) and two useless apps called ""getapps"" (a app market of some sorts) and ""Music"" (full of random youtube videos as home feed). Also I saw a ""wallpaper carousel"" option in settings for lock screen which I assume like ""glance"" on midrange phones. Uninstalled the ""Music"" app rightaway and will be disabling few stock google apps (like google tv, google home etc) and ""getapps"" via adb/Universal debloater for Xiaomi. I kinda expected the whole hyperos experience to not be 100% awesome so these are just nitpicks. No random ad notification or stuff anywhere. Oh and the camera unit makes a rattle sound like a baby's toy when shaken. Trust me I have used iphones and Samsungs but never I heard so much OIS related shaky sounds when phone is shaken. Could be a deal breaker for some. Not an issue for me (because the sensors are just 🤌)

So that was my honest feedback for this phone, by only using it for few hours. So far loving this experience and planning to keep it for at least 3-4 years (provided the hardware doesn't fail on me).

If I have to sum up in one sentence what I am liking most about this phone - that is the photo quality. There's a certain overprocessing and ""flat"" style in the photos taken by flagship phones I previously used from reputed brands. This phone is completely out of that league. Hope future updates don't ruin the processing of this camera. Everything depends on Xiaomi.; Even after having such a high price there has been a lack of quality control. Was facing poor call quality within a few days of purchase. At first thought, it was a network/sim issue. Got a new sim but the issue remained. Finally, after speaking to customer care, checked audio recorder and found it was not working. Visit to the service centre confirmed it to be a hardware issue. Xiaomi is refusing replacement of the device citing 10 days have passed since I bought this. The Priority Club people also seem to be rude and were unhelpful and not understanding. Left a bad experience after spending such a huge amount of hard-earned money. Who thinks that such an expensive phone will have such an issue with such a basic phone function. How is one supposed to detect such a defect within 10 days. The device has two mics so the call was still working but poor. One naturally blames the network. Unfair and unprofessional on the part of Xiaomi.; It's a very good mobile under 1lakh
Great display with superfast fingerprint scanner
Very good camera quality with video recording
Look wise very nice phone
charging speed is superb and wireless is also
Go for it.; Camera is good. It feels premium. Battery life is good. Gets warm while using Camera. Overall Value for Money. Gallery App needs to get more features.; Battery life is 1 day plus, best performance in android, sound quality is good for ear, main highlight is camera, if the camera is yours main priority then just buy it, weight distribution is good, feels premium in hand, everyone will notice phone in your hand"

Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +1 respect for apple to show such concern with user.

Apple phones are same ? like 13 vs 14
The reason 14 is same as 13 may be business practice followed from 11th edition. But please note that iPhone making changes internally like physical components (small change in battery performance, lens in 14 edition), additional features but that may not satisfy you to buy 14 edition. If you do not find ""the very few changes"" interesting in 14, go for 13. Because physical and even cameras are not visually very much different in 13 vs 14 comparison. Also you get 13 for cheap :)
14 is just added features but that is not for daily use, the features real time use is rare case. But the best part is there is no extra cost between 13 vs 14 prices (except extra 10k slash)

Concern you must have.
Apple is not giving chargers and their silicon cases are very expensive (but very good in touch and scratch friendly in back due to silk layer). This is an issue for sure. You have to buy charger not coming with USB C and claiming that you help carbon footprint, understandable but not customer friendly business model. Even after the purchase I had to spend at least 7k for charger and case.

Apple care.
I am not buying it, I pay for phone which is already expensive for this premium and apple care does have strict policy that if you understand that is waste. Instead I find a private insurance to make things better.; Genuine apple product, delivered as promised by Amazon. It’s total paisa vasool. Being an iPhone you can go for it with total peace of mind. Excellent camera both during day and night with a good battery life.; Positive:
Product looks good, batter life is good, picture quality is good.
Negative:
Lighting charger adapter is not included in the package.
Touch screen is not smooth as in other iPhone; Camera I like. Appearance also good. Value for money product; Iphone always high level; Great Product.; Everything is perfect. Doesn’t matter if it’s having 60Hz refresh rate. Very reliable battery, camera, iOS.; Do not get an iphone for now. Their software updates cause hardware issues like damaged display and camera. In my case the latest 17.5.1 update broke the flash and the so called apple senior advisers read scripts like a robot. The service centers do what they please and they wanted 32000 to fix my flash issue that happened due to their update. Also in service centre’s terms and conditions they can cause cosmetic damage and they will mot be responsible for that. It’s mentioned in their repair terms and agreements."

Here are some key points about my experience:

1. Seamless Setup: Setting up my new iPhone was a breeze. Apple's migration tool effortlessly transferred all my contacts, photos, and apps from my Android device. It was a stress-free process that ensured I didn't lose any important data.

2. Intuitive User Interface: The iOS interface on the iPhone 14 Plus is incredibly user-friendly. Navigating through the device, customizing settings, and finding apps is straightforward, even for someone who was accustomed to Android.

3. Performance: The iPhone 14 Plus packs a powerful punch. The device runs smoothly, and apps load quickly. Multitasking is a breeze, thanks to the robust hardware and optimized software.

4. Display: The OLED display on the iPhone 14 Plus is stunning. Colors are vibrant, and the screen is sharp and clear. It's a joy to use for watching videos, browsing, and gaming.

5. Camera: The camera quality on the iPhone 14 Plus is exceptional. The photos and videos captured are rich in detail and clarity. The advanced camera features and modes provide ample opportunities for creativity.

6. App Ecosystem: The App Store offers a vast selection of high-quality apps that enhance the iPhone experience. I found all my favorite Android apps and discovered some excellent iOS exclusives.

7. Privacy and Security: Apple's commitment to user privacy and security is evident. Features like App Tracking Transparency and Face ID add an extra layer of protection.

8. Battery Life: The battery life on the iPhone 14 Plus is impressive. I can comfortably go through a day of heavy usage without worrying about running out of power.

In conclusion, my transition from Android to the iPhone 14 Plus has been a positive one. The device offers a premium experience with a top-notch camera, excellent performance, and an ecosystem that keeps everything well-integrated. If you're considering the switch, I highly recommend it for a seamless and satisfying smartphone experience.; It’s my first iphone and i see that it has a verygood battery life, as I’ve used it for 15-16 days and one single charge upto 100% can easily hold till 2complete days, in one charge cycle I’ve watched
6eposids of 30mins each and a movie of 2hr25min.
Overall batter is really osm, I didn’t expect this from iphone. I usually keep the power between 30% to 80% and this holds for 1 to 1(1/2) in a decent use of continuous screen time about 5 to 6hrs smoothly.
Well battery is good..
(single battery% stands for 9-10minutes on light usage if rough usage then 7-8min definitely)

Now come to it’s performance,
Obviously with appleA15 chipset it’s really soo smooth, overall having a 60hz display while all ther brand are running with 120hz display. But still i say it is smooth to a good decent level.
If i come to gaming side, no doubt u can go for it, but as its display is 60hz it may get u some change if u are a heavy gamer(I’m don’t play much games😅)

Well come to the camera part,
Obviously iPhones are verywell known for their camera quality, compared to pro series it has only 12+12 Mp camera setup it doesn’t have 48mp setup as pro. But still it best pics as good as pro.

On screen brightness I not impressed with it, It’s not that bright to see under heavy sunlight quite difficult but can be seen but not clear.
Well compared to pro, pro can be easily seen under heavy sun easily without any difficulties. Can be seen clearly.

On waterproof, no doubt you can swim with it 😅
I’ve done it twice and daily I carry it while I’m bathing.
Definitely 👍 good.

On build quality, screen with ceramic display it’s really soo durable, I’ve placed screen on heavy surfaces without tempered glass and i can’t see any scratches on the screen. But edges are quite disappointing with aluminium frame is quite delicate on third day after buying it slipped from my had on one side of edge and boom it shot with a slight dent on edge.

If i talk about Speakers they are really good and easily audible at a heavy traffic noise too. Overall speakers are good 👍

Overall i can say it’s worth to spend 80k on this mobile.
So you can go for it.; This is my first iPhone experience and I loved using this.
Camera quality is decent and big screen size fullfills my content consumption demand.
Battery backup is also great.
It is smooth in use."

I got bored to android and wanted some change so switched to iPhone. Redmi phones otherwise are awesome too.😊

Following are my experiences based on 8 days usage:
- Battery backup is very good.
Scenario 1:
I got 3 days of backup with light usage(picking up the calls, replying whatsapp, 30 minutes of gameplay (genshin impact). For 1 and half days, my phone was on battery saver mode. For the rest of duration it was on normal mode.
Scenario 2: Only on normal mode with moderate usage it gives 2 days of backup with light usage.
- Performance is awesome. Everything is buttery smooth from apps to games.
- Latest ios 17 is good as well. I didnt felt much problems while switching from android to iphone. Many things are improved.
- You can remove most of the inbuilt apple apps with ios 17.

Things i love about iPhone over android (redmi phones):
- flawless performance especially for gaming. No android can offer this level of smoothness.
- excellent and all rounder camera.
- more battery backup compared to any android

Things i love about android over iPhone:
- android is more flexible than ios. e.g you can’t select all emails in gmail app in iphone. You cant close all background running apps in one shot like we do it in android.
- apps are way better in terms of usability.
- i personally found that ios has more bugs than android ( which can be felt by a common user). E.g. keyboard sound suddenly increases, not able to receive a call sometimes. Apple do resolve these in their updates but for a phone which costs this much it’s embarrassing.
- cheap cost compared to iphone. People usually go for iphone when they get bored from android (my case) or to be a status symbol or who needs reliable phone for long run. But the things have changed now. Even android offers long term support now and they are bit cheaper compared to iphone giving you more features and usability.

Final verdict: iphone is allrounder phone in my opinion. Great camera, great performance, great battery life, great cost too😁. So if you need a change definitely go for it. Its a great phone.; Charging is fast till 80% , battery backup is good , feels premium and good in hand; The great mobile with amazing features, build quality is so good, amazing camera with stunning pictures. Good battery life,good performance.; ; Battery backup verry good Amazing project Thanks Amazon"
