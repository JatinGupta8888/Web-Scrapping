Great 11 inch display, i did not feel any lag ever during my office activities of reading pdf, powerpoint, seeing videos and mp4. I do not do gaming.
Lound ,crystal clear sound with spatial distinction, supports dolby .
Has bluetooth and also headphone jack.
Side slot for microSD card upto 1 TB. My wify model does not support sim.
Those who have bought wify+sim suppport, the side slot supports microSD card and sim.
Usual Samsung One UI ...very convenient and easy to switch contacts, sms, downloads etc. Also logging in and setting up the tab using my another samsung phone was super easy and headache free. Also the Quallcom Snapdragon processor is reliable and heavy duty proof.
Dislike...
The main camera in rear is mediocre. Compared to such great device, configuration and display support ,this camera is just plain ordinary without much features.; This is awesome tablet. Very fast and battery life is good too. Highly satisfied with the purchase. I got this on offer for less than 13k in May 24.; Pros:
8 gb Ram..nice speed no lags..
No heating issue even when playing or charging.
Good big sound.
Good resolution..1080 p youtube videos
Good for reading..eyeshield..feature..screen size is big enough for a book page to fit comfirtably..this is what I wanted..
Con:
Battery is drying up even when I am reading only..in one day..every night I need to charge..my previous tab ..samsung 2 gb used to afford me more battery..but given 8gb speed its understandable..
If your requirement is only reading..better go with s6 lite 4 gb which also comes with pencil. But you want some multimedia n games too..then in this price range this one is best with 8gb RAM.
I am a happy customer. 5 out of 5 stars.; 1)First of all the seal was broken.
2) I found glues are shown between screen and body on all sides of the tab,which looks like a repaired one.
3)Month and Year in the box is showing March 2024 but I found so many screen shots in image folder, whose created date is showing Nov 2023.
4)There is no temporary screen guard on the screen as new phones or tabs usually have.; I got this at a very low price of 14k so it is a value for money amazing speaker quality good screen size for this price point; Has most of the features required in the latest technology tablet. Sufficient speed, memory and picture quality.; Overall tablet is nice ...but if you are using it more than 3.5 hours...then pls dont but it.; i had bought in february and now in june no issues. Tab works smoothly ,only battery drains out quickly even if not using it so have to charge frequently."

Display is good with no extreme stress on eyes. Touch screen is soft to touch. Processor is good and works effectively with speed. I am satisfied with the product.; ; 5g Tab in most affordable price..After buying update the OS,then only touch pen will work properly.; Thy provided me an used product with touch response defect ...and next day refused to exchange rather suggested to go to service center ..... now i am thinking about consumer court; The battery life is extremely poor, draining quickly. I barely had enough time to watch a few YouTube videos and half of a movie on Netflix. Without even using it much the next day, the battery is completely drained, and by evening it's only at 20 percent. The thumb unlocking doesn't work well, and the facial recognition is terrible. Most of the time, you have to type in your password. I can't comprehend why people are so enthusiastic about this product.; Good battery backup good
Display; All of it is perfect...not for heavy gaming; This tablet is only for Arabic regions! My Country/region Is not in it. I will return this tablet and get one that has country choices..... I AM CHANGING MY REVIEW! I FIGURED IT OUT!
I was about to return it when I decided to give it another try! Luckily,
I was able to set it up easily! This tablet is wonderful! Clear picture, very thin and light weight. I am very happy with this tablet and I recommend it. 5 ✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️; Cette tablette ne fonctionne pas au Canada. J’ai parlé à un technicien de Samsung qui m’a dit de contacter Amazon. Incapable de parler à quelqu’un chez Amazon!; Very Happy With It; If you're looking to play casually. Sure. But if you're looking to play professionally or top-tier. Nope. It runs the game just fine, but the screen jitters when you move your camera. It makes precise aiming incredibly impossible sometimes the swiping is fast and sometimes it's slow, it has to do with how the screen registers where your finger is.

And if you play with a six-finger cloth or so many fingers on the screen that this doesn't even know how to sense your fingers.

If you're only looking for performance then this is good, but if you're looking to improve and accurately shoot at people, I can't recommend this.

My previous device was the Apple iPad Pro 2020 11-in and I played professionally on that.

The screen jitteriness on this one makes it almost impossible to be consistently accurate when shooting at people.; Purchased for my wife and she loves everything about it. Nice clear display, great sound quality, and quite a snappy performer. We have had several android tablets but always go back to Samsung. Connects easily to the internet and mobile hotspot from her phone so she can watch her tv shows anywhere. She is very happy and so am I, very happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone."

It just simply delivers what you can expect from an Android tablet at this low price.. You can use it for watching stuff on streaming services at Full HD resolution , netflix prime video hotstar etc all work satisfactorily on this device. And its also okay for reading books/manga thanks to the big and crisp IPS screen.

Pros-
1. 10 inch IPS Full HD screen
2. Okay battery life (lasts for about a day)
3. Surprisingly decent stereo speakers
4. Comes with Android 12 and mostly bloat-free experience, there are a few useless pre-installed apps but you can uninstall/disable all of it pretty easily
5. All Google apps ecosystem are also available on this

Cons-
1. no headphone jack so you need to use bluetooth earphones
2. brightness a bit lacking if you use it in bright area and the screen is also susceptible to glare
3. charging is kinda slow
4. RAM is a bit low at just 3GB so if you multi-task the apps in background usually gets cleared out from memory

Overall I suppose it is fine for an absolutely cheap entry level tablet , cant really expect much more at this price.; After nearly two weeks of using the Honor X8 3/32 tablet, I wanted to share my experience. This tablet truly offers exceptional value for money.

Display: While the display brightness is a bit lower than optimal, the video quality is good overall.

Design: The tablet has an attractive appearance and feels well-made. Its quality gives off a rich feel.

Battery: The battery life is satisfactory, lasting for around 12 hours with intermittent use. However, charging speed, even with a fast charger, is disappointingly slow.

Performance: The tablet's performance is decent across various tasks, thanks to the Mediatek Helio G80 processor and Android 12 with Magic UI 6.1.

Camera: Although not the tablet's strongest feature, the cameras serve their general purpose adequately.

Speakers: The stereo speakers produce impressive sound quality.

Additional Features: Efficient Bluetooth connectivity and support for dual-band WiFi (2.4GHz and 5GHz) are notable highlights. However, the storage transfer speed averages around 20MBps.

User Experience: Despite having only 3GB of RAM, the tablet delivers smooth performance. However, the limited 32GB internal storage, mostly occupied by preinstalled apps, may necessitate purchasing external memory. Additionally, there is a slight touch sensitivity issue, albeit rare and manageable.

Conclusion: The Honor X8 3/32 tablet excels in tasks such as video streaming, reading, light gaming, and multitasking. Its affordability and reliable performance make it a standout choice in its price range. While it lacks certain accessories like a charger and flipback cover, its overall value proposition remains unbeatable. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking an affordable yet capable tablet solution.; Hello all,

I recently purchased the Honor Pad X8 at an effective price of 9.9K. And at this price this is unbeatable! Please note that no charger is included in the box - only the USB cable.
Below are the pros & cons:

Pros:

Crisp 10.1 inch FHD LCD display (60Hz only though - can't expect 120Hz under 10K)
Good sound quality, with good enough base. It becomes quite loud at full volume
Metallic finish, though it's mostly plastic.
File transfers are fairly fast when connected to a PC
Android 12 out of the box, which is just 1 generation old as of 2023
Can play 4K videos too
USB type C support

Cons:

Below average cameras (Rear is 5MP with 1080p/30FPS recording, front is 2MP with only 720p/30FPS recording)
Charges at 10 watts only, so takes a long time to charge the 5100mAH battery
A bit on the heavier side at 460 grams.
No charger included in the box
No 3.5mm jack

I don't know about the gaming performance as I don't play games. But as far as I know, the Helio G80 processor (though over 3 years old in 2023) in this can handle casual gaming & gaming at lower settings.
What I can definitely say is that this is a perfect tablet for watching movies, listening to music, taking online classes, working on documents, video calls etc.; For the price its good. Display is good and battery life too. Its a bit heavier but great for a student. Only con no charger in box; Excellent product, good value for money, good touch sensivity , ease of use , smooth UI , good graphics, high speed for 3: 32 variant only high RAM can be higher speed; Amazing device at this price range....compared with mobile , some features missing...but goof battery backup...for average users , it's comes with 2 , 3 days...big screen very useful for official workers...also enjoyed the reels videos viewers. then two minus point it hasn't jack pin for headsets , only bluetooth headphones and comes without charger.; Clean and simple relatively thin but sturdy product. I needed a big screen with decent clarity & got it. Charging I had 18w charger which charges well. I only felt the absence of 3.5mm jack. Decent performance by Honor X8 tablet. Let me come back after a week of use."

Look no further and buy this one.
1. Screen quality very nice.
2. Sound quality I bet it beats apple 9th gen by far
3. It gives you 128GB with an option to increase further using SD card. Why would somebody stuck with 64GB. I do heavy download of videos for offline, 64 gb out of which almost 20GB used by OS.
4. In Android world OnePlus Oxygen OS stands out. No bloatware, clean and fast. Also promised 4 yrs updates.
5. People say G99 processor, performance is not good. I am spending around 17000 rs . I am getting decent performance for casual gaming and watch media content in good quality resolution, which I may say for most is sole purpose of tablet.
6. Tablet is mostly bought for on the go content watching. This one has very good battery backup and better than ipad ,fast charging.
7. Yes 400 nits max screen brightness, people say less for outdoor. But think how many times you go out in bright sunlight, either you watch in vehicle and in shades. Also 400 nits consumes less battery.
8. If you want tablet to be like laptop with only 17000 rs. Look for something else.
9. For students only con it does not support apple pencil kind of pencil for note taking. But then it is half the price from apple ipad 9 + apple pencil. And note taking works with cheap magnetic tip pencils.
10. Quality, the moment you hold it, it gives premium feeling.

Overall best budget tablet, value for money .; Sim 4G with wifi calling enabled working fine
Battery is good
Ram and memory superb
Decent device for stock trading
WhatsApp calling available
Video calling is available
Display is good & Sound quality is great
Charging is good
Camera decent
Useful split window
Dual window
Best short cuts
Connect to external Bluetooth ear phone
There are several hidden features; Good product for viewing and reading.Charging is excellent and battery life long lasting.
Performance wise very good. Very smooth in handling. Money's worth.; Was looking for a basic tablet around ₹20k to read pdf books. This does that job well . Also videos from apps are good. Can play games as well (unless you are looking for high fps games with6any frame drops)

Very satisfied. Serves my purpose well.

Pros:
+Vibrant display in 7:5 magazine aspect ratio
+ Enough performance for all day today tasks
+ Sleek design
+ Good battery life
Cons:
- Fingerprint sensor on this would haveade it complete tablet; Display is very nice sound is good design and battery back up is good .. overall product is good; Superb big sized screen.It's delightful. Stunning Dolby Atmos with 4 speakers.Good processor and fine bright display.Almost a premium tablet at a bargain price.Feels like Apple iPad at a fraction of its price.; I bought this tablet to study, so on this point the tablet does its work well. The camera is very basic which I can't complain about given the price point. However, my only concerns are the battery and the delivery experience.

First of all, when I received the product two days ago, I found that the packaging was clearly tampered. The seal on the folio case was broken and though the seal was intact on the tablet's packaging case, I could still find clues it was opened before I did. I was very very concerned but because I couldn't find any noticeable damage the customer service couldn't do anything.

Secondly, the battery according to me is draining faster than what should be normal for a brand new device. For example, if I watch a video for 1.5 hours, the battery will drain from 100% to 89%. This is my first tablet so I don't know if this is normal but I am concerned that in the long run this draining will be speed up. Though the charging happens super fast. That's a good point.

The refresh rate is okay. It took me some time to get used to the slight delays and occassional stutters when scrolling, but gradually I got used to it.

Because of the large display it offers a good experience in reading and watching lectures. Overall, I think it's a good and affordable tablet for those who have basic requirements in studing and taking notes. Except I'm still anxious about the battery. I am using a capacitative stylus for note taking.; Amazing screen quality smooth touch good performance camera is also good, quick connectivity, I loved it. Charging is also good, all features are good. Feels amazing to use very classy look"

Also some office work can be achieved.
Charging takes long and battery does deplete fast if the display brightness is kept high.
Sound wise the speaker media volume is on the low side- my phone is louder. And the call audio quality suffers from some intermittent echo.
Touch and colours are nice enough.
The cover and screen guard that come together with are convenient but the screen guard is not DIY. Mine got way too many bubbles. If you're not practiced with it best take it to a professional to get the job done.; Very amazing product with child lock facilities
Gifted my brother and he is just enjoying it!; Lenovo tab uploaded with lots of application of no use, they occupied almost 18 GB space out of 64GB which is so high. This tab is full of glitches and doesn't work properly. It gets hang and freeze the screen until battery dies. Also get switch off in the middle of work even after having good charged battery. Also phone doesn't work; neither voice reach other side nor comes in clearly. Phone call gives so much disturbance.
Now it is not getting switch on after getting switch off in the middle of my work.
So Disappointed. Just Waste of Money, time and Efforts.
It is not worth buying - Not Even 1%.; Awesome product, good sound ,charging ,it's worth; It is not good; For now its charge as fast

Firstly, a big thanks to Amazon for hassle free exchange and delivery on time! And seller Appario retail once again has impressed me with their quality service.
Coming to the tablet, it's hands down the best there is at the budget range.
Screen- 8/10 As good as a TFT panel can be, bright enough and vibrant enough. It's no AMOLED but it's great. I didn't listen to the bad reviews, thankfully. There's no light bleed on my unit, as so many have said. Maybe they've fixed the issue. I had a Galaxy Tab 10.1 with a very good display. The contrast level is much better here. Viewing angles could have been little better though.
Processor- 8/10 I think nobody's buying this tablet to seriously pursue heavy gaming. For the regular user, the updated SD720G is a very snappy processor. No lags or jitters. I've worked with drawing apps and Rough Animator without any issues at all. RAM plus takes care of multitasking and app management.
Battery- good enough to last a day of use. Depends what kind of user you are, for average user it'll last more than a day. Expect SOT of 7-8 hrs at least! Just video streaming can last for 10-11 hrs at medium brightness!
S-PEN- 10/10 The reason why most people will be buying this tablet, and it will not disappoint. It takes the whole experience to a different level. Works like a charm, Samsung has fine tuned it over so many years. Worth it!
Software- 10/10 Samsung IS the most evolved Android UI there is at the moment. And they have optimised it for tablet. So many features like multi windows, gestures, air command and their integrated ecosystem and features like Samsung Dex work seamlessly for work user experience. Plus Samsung is exceptional nowadays with updates.
So my experience with this tablet is awesome and it's the best there is at this range. Period. Some other manufacturers like Lenovo,Realme etc may seemingly give you more bang for the same cost. But nothing can match the overall experience.
Overall 8.5/10
Value for money- 10/10 as the s-pen is included!; I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite during a great summer offer, and at the price of 14k, it's hard to find fault with. It's an ideal choice for professionals needing it for office use, students looking to take notes, and beginner artists.

In terms of performance, I found it to be quite efficient for everyday tasks. However, at its regular pricing, I would complain that it shows some lag when multitasking. The sound quality is good, but it could be louder for a more immersive entertainment experience. Overall, considering its current price, the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a worthwhile investment for those seeking a versatile and affordable tablet; If you are a student or a working professional and need to take notes or create slides, this is what you need. Value for money and under 25k budget this is the best buy.
Fast charging. Screen size is quite good to watch youtube videos, with a quite decent RAM it provides smoothness. And my favourite part is the pen.; Love this tablet, it isn't super powerful like my phone but it's still more fun to use the tablet, and the S pen it's fantastic; S pen working very well.overall satisfied with it performance. camera quality is not too good, overall I can say in this price range good tablet; The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a great tablet for students who are looking for a device that can handle both study and productivity tasks. It comes with an S Pen stylus that is included in the box, which makes it easy to take notes, draw, and annotate documents. The stylus also attaches magnetically to the side of the tablet, so you don't have to worry about losing it.

The tablet has a 10.4-inch TFT display that is bright and sharp, with good viewing angles and colors. The screen size is ideal for watching videos, reading e-books, and browsing the web. The tablet also has dual speakers that are tuned by AKG, which deliver clear and loud sound quality.

The tablet is powered by an snapdragon processor, which is capable of handling most apps and games smoothly. The tablet also has 4GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of internal storage, which can be expanded with a microSD card. The battery life is impressive, as the tablet can last for up to 12 hours of video playback on a single charge.

The tablet has a sleek and premium design, with a metal back and thin bezels. It is available in three colors: Angora Blue, Oxford Gray, and Chiffon Pink. The tablet is also lightweight and slim, making it easy to carry around.

The tablet runs on Android 13 with One UI on top, which offers a lot of customization options and features. The tablet also supports Samsung DeX mode, which allows you to connect the tablet to a monitor or TV and use it as a desktop PC. The tablet also has some useful apps pre-installed, such as Samsung Notes, Samsung Kids, and Netflix.

The only drawbacks of the tablet are that it does not have an AMOLED display, which would have offered better contrast and colors; it does not have a fingerprint scanner or face unlock, which would have made it more secure; and it does not have a keyboard cover accessory, which would have made it more productive. The s Pen is the magic wand 🪄 but it's tip got damaged only after 4 days of use....

Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a fantastic tablet for students who want a versatile device that can handle both study and productivity tasks. It offers a good display, a powerful performance, a long battery life, a premium design, and an S Pen stylus that is included in the box. It is also priced reasonably compared to other tablets in the market. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is definitely a must-buy for students who are looking for a tablet that can do it all.

Great 11 inch display, i did not feel any lag ever during my office activities of reading pdf, powerpoint, seeing videos and mp4. I do not do gaming.
Lound ,crystal clear sound with spatial distinction, supports dolby .
Has bluetooth and also headphone jack.
Side slot for microSD card upto 1 TB. My wify model does not support sim.
Those who have bought wify+sim suppport, the side slot supports microSD card and sim.
Usual Samsung One UI ...very convenient and easy to switch contacts, sms, downloads etc. Also logging in and setting up the tab using my another samsung phone was super easy and headache free. Also the Quallcom Snapdragon processor is reliable and heavy duty proof.
Dislike...
The main camera in rear is mediocre. Compared to such great device, configuration and display support ,this camera is just plain ordinary without much features.; This is awesome tablet. Very fast and battery life is good too. Highly satisfied with the purchase. I got this on offer for less than 13k in May 24.; Pros:
8 gb Ram..nice speed no lags..
No heating issue even when playing or charging.
Good big sound.
Good resolution..1080 p youtube videos
Good for reading..eyeshield..feature..screen size is big enough for a book page to fit comfirtably..this is what I wanted..
Con:
Battery is drying up even when I am reading only..in one day..every night I need to charge..my previous tab ..samsung 2 gb used to afford me more battery..but given 8gb speed its understandable..
If your requirement is only reading..better go with s6 lite 4 gb which also comes with pencil. But you want some multimedia n games too..then in this price range this one is best with 8gb RAM.
I am a happy customer. 5 out of 5 stars.; 1)First of all the seal was broken.
2) I found glues are shown between screen and body on all sides of the tab,which looks like a repaired one.
3)Month and Year in the box is showing March 2024 but I found so many screen shots in image folder, whose created date is showing Nov 2023.
4)There is no temporary screen guard on the screen as new phones or tabs usually have.; I got this at a very low price of 14k so it is a value for money amazing speaker quality good screen size for this price point; Has most of the features required in the latest technology tablet. Sufficient speed, memory and picture quality.; Overall tablet is nice ...but if you are using it more than 3.5 hours...then pls dont but it.; i had bought in february and now in june no issues. Tab works smoothly ,only battery drains out quickly even if not using it so have to charge frequently."

I was able to set it up easily! This tablet is wonderful! Clear picture, very thin and light weight. I am very happy with this tablet and I recommend it. 5 ✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️; Cette tablette ne fonctionne pas au Canada. J’ai parlé à un technicien de Samsung qui m’a dit de contacter Amazon. Incapable de parler à quelqu’un chez Amazon!; Very Happy With It; If you're looking to play casually. Sure. But if you're looking to play professionally or top-tier. Nope. It runs the game just fine, but the screen jitters when you move your camera. It makes precise aiming incredibly impossible sometimes the swiping is fast and sometimes it's slow, it has to do with how the screen registers where your finger is.

And if you play with a six-finger cloth or so many fingers on the screen that this doesn't even know how to sense your fingers.

If you're only looking for performance then this is good, but if you're looking to improve and accurately shoot at people, I can't recommend this.

My previous device was the Apple iPad Pro 2020 11-in and I played professionally on that.

The screen jitteriness on this one makes it almost impossible to be consistently accurate when shooting at people.; Purchased for my wife and she loves everything about it. Nice clear display, great sound quality, and quite a snappy performer. We have had several android tablets but always go back to Samsung. Connects easily to the internet and mobile hotspot from her phone so she can watch her tv shows anywhere. She is very happy and so am I, very happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone."

TAB is real disappointment

It hangs a lot and screen brightness is real issue.

Don't even think of buying this unless you just want to waste your money.; I am writting this review almost after a month of usage of this tablet. I am personally very happy with the product and overall features. Worth to buy with this price for such great performance tablet.; This is a very nice tablet.. Working very smoothly.. Hardware and software both are working fine.. No heating problem.. No hanging.. Viewing experience is very good.. Battery backup is good.. Finish and looks are premium..; Don't expect more with it .. Average product. It is good for browsing and multimedia. Display is good, battery backup could better. Sometimes it will get hang if you use multiple applications.overall it is a average tab. But does its job well.; My best decision to go for the purchase. Display and sound are the highlights for the product with user friendly and smooth UI experience. Overall, great buy at this price point. Definitely recommend to go for this."

Great 11 inch display, i did not feel any lag ever during my office activities of reading pdf, powerpoint, seeing videos and mp4. I do not do gaming.
Lound ,crystal clear sound with spatial distinction, supports dolby .
Has bluetooth and also headphone jack.
Side slot for microSD card upto 1 TB. My wify model does not support sim.
Those who have bought wify+sim suppport, the side slot supports microSD card and sim.
Usual Samsung One UI ...very convenient and easy to switch contacts, sms, downloads etc. Also logging in and setting up the tab using my another samsung phone was super easy and headache free. Also the Quallcom Snapdragon processor is reliable and heavy duty proof.
Dislike...
The main camera in rear is mediocre. Compared to such great device, configuration and display support ,this camera is just plain ordinary without much features.; This is awesome tablet. Very fast and battery life is good too. Highly satisfied with the purchase. I got this on offer for less than 13k in May 24.; Pros:
8 gb Ram..nice speed no lags..
No heating issue even when playing or charging.
Good big sound.
Good resolution..1080 p youtube videos
Good for reading..eyeshield..feature..screen size is big enough for a book page to fit comfirtably..this is what I wanted..
Con:
Battery is drying up even when I am reading only..in one day..every night I need to charge..my previous tab ..samsung 2 gb used to afford me more battery..but given 8gb speed its understandable..
If your requirement is only reading..better go with s6 lite 4 gb which also comes with pencil. But you want some multimedia n games too..then in this price range this one is best with 8gb RAM.
I am a happy customer. 5 out of 5 stars.; 1)First of all the seal was broken.
2) I found glues are shown between screen and body on all sides of the tab,which looks like a repaired one.
3)Month and Year in the box is showing March 2024 but I found so many screen shots in image folder, whose created date is showing Nov 2023.
4)There is no temporary screen guard on the screen as new phones or tabs usually have.; I got this at a very low price of 14k so it is a value for money amazing speaker quality good screen size for this price point; Has most of the features required in the latest technology tablet. Sufficient speed, memory and picture quality.; Overall tablet is nice ...but if you are using it more than 3.5 hours...then pls dont but it.; i had bought in february and now in june no issues. Tab works smoothly ,only battery drains out quickly even if not using it so have to charge frequently."

It just simply delivers what you can expect from an Android tablet at this low price.. You can use it for watching stuff on streaming services at Full HD resolution , netflix prime video hotstar etc all work satisfactorily on this device. And its also okay for reading books/manga thanks to the big and crisp IPS screen.

Pros-
1. 10 inch IPS Full HD screen
2. Okay battery life (lasts for about a day)
3. Surprisingly decent stereo speakers
4. Comes with Android 12 and mostly bloat-free experience, there are a few useless pre-installed apps but you can uninstall/disable all of it pretty easily
5. All Google apps ecosystem are also available on this

Cons-
1. no headphone jack so you need to use bluetooth earphones
2. brightness a bit lacking if you use it in bright area and the screen is also susceptible to glare
3. charging is kinda slow
4. RAM is a bit low at just 3GB so if you multi-task the apps in background usually gets cleared out from memory

Overall I suppose it is fine for an absolutely cheap entry level tablet , cant really expect much more at this price.; After nearly two weeks of using the Honor X8 3/32 tablet, I wanted to share my experience. This tablet truly offers exceptional value for money.

Display: While the display brightness is a bit lower than optimal, the video quality is good overall.

Design: The tablet has an attractive appearance and feels well-made. Its quality gives off a rich feel.

Battery: The battery life is satisfactory, lasting for around 12 hours with intermittent use. However, charging speed, even with a fast charger, is disappointingly slow.

Performance: The tablet's performance is decent across various tasks, thanks to the Mediatek Helio G80 processor and Android 12 with Magic UI 6.1.

Camera: Although not the tablet's strongest feature, the cameras serve their general purpose adequately.

Speakers: The stereo speakers produce impressive sound quality.

Additional Features: Efficient Bluetooth connectivity and support for dual-band WiFi (2.4GHz and 5GHz) are notable highlights. However, the storage transfer speed averages around 20MBps.

User Experience: Despite having only 3GB of RAM, the tablet delivers smooth performance. However, the limited 32GB internal storage, mostly occupied by preinstalled apps, may necessitate purchasing external memory. Additionally, there is a slight touch sensitivity issue, albeit rare and manageable.

Conclusion: The Honor X8 3/32 tablet excels in tasks such as video streaming, reading, light gaming, and multitasking. Its affordability and reliable performance make it a standout choice in its price range. While it lacks certain accessories like a charger and flipback cover, its overall value proposition remains unbeatable. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking an affordable yet capable tablet solution.; Hello all,

I recently purchased the Honor Pad X8 at an effective price of 9.9K. And at this price this is unbeatable! Please note that no charger is included in the box - only the USB cable.
Below are the pros & cons:

Pros:

Crisp 10.1 inch FHD LCD display (60Hz only though - can't expect 120Hz under 10K)
Good sound quality, with good enough base. It becomes quite loud at full volume
Metallic finish, though it's mostly plastic.
File transfers are fairly fast when connected to a PC
Android 12 out of the box, which is just 1 generation old as of 2023
Can play 4K videos too
USB type C support

Cons:

Below average cameras (Rear is 5MP with 1080p/30FPS recording, front is 2MP with only 720p/30FPS recording)
Charges at 10 watts only, so takes a long time to charge the 5100mAH battery
A bit on the heavier side at 460 grams.
No charger included in the box
No 3.5mm jack

I don't know about the gaming performance as I don't play games. But as far as I know, the Helio G80 processor (though over 3 years old in 2023) in this can handle casual gaming & gaming at lower settings.
What I can definitely say is that this is a perfect tablet for watching movies, listening to music, taking online classes, working on documents, video calls etc.; For the price its good. Display is good and battery life too. Its a bit heavier but great for a student. Only con no charger in box; Excellent product, good value for money, good touch sensivity , ease of use , smooth UI , good graphics, high speed for 3: 32 variant only high RAM can be higher speed; Amazing device at this price range....compared with mobile , some features missing...but goof battery backup...for average users , it's comes with 2 , 3 days...big screen very useful for official workers...also enjoyed the reels videos viewers. then two minus point it hasn't jack pin for headsets , only bluetooth headphones and comes without charger.; Clean and simple relatively thin but sturdy product. I needed a big screen with decent clarity & got it. Charging I had 18w charger which charges well. I only felt the absence of 3.5mm jack. Decent performance by Honor X8 tablet. Let me come back after a week of use."

I opted for exchange with my iPhone, while preparing for exchange already we have formatted or remove the iCloud from the mobile for exchanging but they are asking a verification code that too in the exchanging mobile and later I connected to Wi-Fi and opened Amazon website but in that there is no option about verification code so the delivery person is forcing me to pay the charge or cancel the product later I paid the exchange value and receive the product but while buying I paid 129 for the exchange pickup but it’s not reduced in the final value it’s a bad experience; The unboxed Tab had shows that it's been reset to factory settings please use previously used pattern or Gmail I'd to unlock.

Amazon can't you verify incase return product is used or any factory reset are happened.

Lenovo on other hand have a worst warranty registration process. Upon saying tablet having issue they want register warranty first, then only service can be taken up. After sending mail to pop@lenovo.com it's been 10 days No reply.

If ask Lenovo customer care then we didn't receive your mail send mail from different account and takes 3 days for warranty registration only. Its been 15days just sending mails and taking with Amazon and Lenovo teams where each is blaming other one.; my son just stepped into his 1st grade in school. in the last week of may 2021 came the good news that he will have online classes. tried the online classes with a mobile phone--- the screen is so small that he would keep it close to his face. tried the laptop but handling it was difficult for him. both of us being working parents its difficult to be beside him during his classes. then i started to search for a tablet and came across lenovo. saw a few good reviews and had used lenovo products earlier. so went for it. nice product real big screen its about 10 cm big. the touch screen is very responsive . the screen colour too are good. the only flaw was lenovo had some chinese video software which kept popping up. so i had to delete the whole app off pretty simple.
then its the good service from amazon. delivered before the due date even during these lockdown times. now my son listens to his class and his grandparents also can monitor it. i bought the one with a sim card so that even if there is no power the internet connection for the video does not go off.; Quality isn’t good enough so as software so laggy. Poor display etc. Final conclusion don’t waste your money.; Less speed than expected.; Value for money; Very slow n poor performance. Hangs again n again."

Best in all aspects.; I'm using this product since 8 months...
It's just an amazing tablet for Student, and also for movies, webseries etc
No lag, outstanding performance, multitasking is also very good,and amazing battery backup...
(Just one OS update)
Overall very good product 🙌🏾; 1. The display is TFT but quality TFT, viewing angles are good enough.
2. Sound is clear and rich but not loud even it has 5 speakers and 1 woover.
3. Build quality is best in the segment.
Processor is powerful enough, I play asphalt 9 with highest graphics mode.
4. Battery optimisation is very much good.
5. It charges at 22.5 watt max. It takes time to get fully charged, though you can twik that in settings.
6. Camera is there, can take photos, that's all.
7. 4+3 gb ram is well optimised.

I think this is all you should know about before buying a tablet.; I purchased this tab 15 days ago and I m going to share what is my experience with this device so far
POSITIVES -
Biggest screen in this price range and bezels are narrow 120 hz buttery smooth
Build quality is good sleek design gives u a feel of holding a premium tab 😜
I m a normal user so it gives me around 12-13 hour battery backup
Brightness is good even u don't need to go above 50 %
Bloatwares are uninstallable
Sound quality is good like really really good
Ui is really good not feels outdated ( and obviously it's not )
MagicOS 7.1 gives u a lot of customisation and features
Supports otg no heating
Great for multitasking even some pad in this range don't support multitasking like this one
NEGATIVES -
snapdragon 685 is good for daily activity but not for gamers can play bgmi in low settings but who likes low graphics 😅 casual gaming is good
No charger but company compansated it with a decent quality case ( case and charger cost the same )
Camera is not good and I think no one uses a tablets camera
IN SHORT - if u are not a gamer just close ur eyes and order it u won't regret I promise; Screen Quality not good, Touch is average, battery is not that expected, Weight is good, Charging is too slow, Display is TFT that is worst thing at this price point. No Return option that's another disappointment. Last point Speaker Quality is worst 🙂 doesn't comes with Dolby Atmos also not that loud it has 6 speakers but sound is not more than a dual speaker smartphone.; Product is best in the segement.
Display is wide enough and bright.
Sleek and smooth experience.
Touch is bit laggy, but at this price point can adjust.
No words for sound quality 10/10
Multiscreen is awesome.
Best fit for use of office with presentation, accounts and all.

The only thing which this would have the game changer is sim card support."

It feels much more expensive than it is - slim design and stylish looks. But the best part is how well it runs. Apps open fast and everything feels smooth, even when I jump between a bunch of things at once. The battery life is also fantastic - I've been using it for hours on a single charge. Overall, I'm super happy with my purchase. If you're looking for a new tablet, I'd definitely recommend checking this one out.; The Redmi Pad SE is awesome for kicking back and enjoying entertainment. The 11-inch display is super smooth thanks to the 90Hz refresh rate, making everything from movies to games a joy to experience. Plus, the battery lasts for ages, so you can binge-watch worry-free.

The build quality is surprisingly good too - feels really sturdy and secure in your hands. Overall, if you're looking for a big-screen tablet for everyday fun at a great price, the Redmi Pad SE is a great choice!; Nice UX, good screen, good battery, 90hz display is amazing, speakers are above average. Aesthetic form factor. Snapdragon processor. 128gb storage that’s also expandable.
All this for 12k? Il take that.; Firstly, wrong TAB delivered to us (instead of 8 GB - 128 GB, they delivered 6 GB - 128 GB) and moreover, no support from Amazon have to file a consumer case for this.

TAB is real disappointment

It hangs a lot and screen brightness is real issue.

Don't even think of buying this unless you just want to waste your money.; I am writting this review almost after a month of usage of this tablet. I am personally very happy with the product and overall features. Worth to buy with this price for such great performance tablet.; This is a very nice tablet.. Working very smoothly.. Hardware and software both are working fine.. No heating problem.. No hanging.. Viewing experience is very good.. Battery backup is good.. Finish and looks are premium..; Don't expect more with it .. Average product. It is good for browsing and multimedia. Display is good, battery backup could better. Sometimes it will get hang if you use multiple applications.overall it is a average tab. But does its job well.; My best decision to go for the purchase. Display and sound are the highlights for the product with user friendly and smooth UI experience. Overall, great buy at this price point. Definitely recommend to go for this."

Look no further and buy this one.
1. Screen quality very nice.
2. Sound quality I bet it beats apple 9th gen by far
3. It gives you 128GB with an option to increase further using SD card. Why would somebody stuck with 64GB. I do heavy download of videos for offline, 64 gb out of which almost 20GB used by OS.
4. In Android world OnePlus Oxygen OS stands out. No bloatware, clean and fast. Also promised 4 yrs updates.
5. People say G99 processor, performance is not good. I am spending around 17000 rs . I am getting decent performance for casual gaming and watch media content in good quality resolution, which I may say for most is sole purpose of tablet.
6. Tablet is mostly bought for on the go content watching. This one has very good battery backup and better than ipad ,fast charging.
7. Yes 400 nits max screen brightness, people say less for outdoor. But think how many times you go out in bright sunlight, either you watch in vehicle and in shades. Also 400 nits consumes less battery.
8. If you want tablet to be like laptop with only 17000 rs. Look for something else.
9. For students only con it does not support apple pencil kind of pencil for note taking. But then it is half the price from apple ipad 9 + apple pencil. And note taking works with cheap magnetic tip pencils.
10. Quality, the moment you hold it, it gives premium feeling.

Overall best budget tablet, value for money .; Sim 4G with wifi calling enabled working fine
Battery is good
Ram and memory superb
Decent device for stock trading
WhatsApp calling available
Video calling is available
Display is good & Sound quality is great
Charging is good
Camera decent
Useful split window
Dual window
Best short cuts
Connect to external Bluetooth ear phone
There are several hidden features; Good product for viewing and reading.Charging is excellent and battery life long lasting.
Performance wise very good. Very smooth in handling. Money's worth.; Was looking for a basic tablet around ₹20k to read pdf books. This does that job well . Also videos from apps are good. Can play games as well (unless you are looking for high fps games with6any frame drops)

Very satisfied. Serves my purpose well.

Pros:
+Vibrant display in 7:5 magazine aspect ratio
+ Enough performance for all day today tasks
+ Sleek design
+ Good battery life
Cons:
- Fingerprint sensor on this would haveade it complete tablet; Display is very nice sound is good design and battery back up is good .. overall product is good; Superb big sized screen.It's delightful. Stunning Dolby Atmos with 4 speakers.Good processor and fine bright display.Almost a premium tablet at a bargain price.Feels like Apple iPad at a fraction of its price.; I bought this tablet to study, so on this point the tablet does its work well. The camera is very basic which I can't complain about given the price point. However, my only concerns are the battery and the delivery experience.

First of all, when I received the product two days ago, I found that the packaging was clearly tampered. The seal on the folio case was broken and though the seal was intact on the tablet's packaging case, I could still find clues it was opened before I did. I was very very concerned but because I couldn't find any noticeable damage the customer service couldn't do anything.

Secondly, the battery according to me is draining faster than what should be normal for a brand new device. For example, if I watch a video for 1.5 hours, the battery will drain from 100% to 89%. This is my first tablet so I don't know if this is normal but I am concerned that in the long run this draining will be speed up. Though the charging happens super fast. That's a good point.

The refresh rate is okay. It took me some time to get used to the slight delays and occassional stutters when scrolling, but gradually I got used to it.

Because of the large display it offers a good experience in reading and watching lectures. Overall, I think it's a good and affordable tablet for those who have basic requirements in studing and taking notes. Except I'm still anxious about the battery. I am using a capacitative stylus for note taking.; Amazing screen quality smooth touch good performance camera is also good, quick connectivity, I loved it. Charging is also good, all features are good. Feels amazing to use very classy look"

Here is my initial review

1. Build Quality: Very good metal back which makes it look premium in hand.

2: Screen: Quality is very good for the price. SAMSUNG is known for it's displays.

3. Battery: Quite good battery life. I didn't measure it exactly but seems pretty good.
Also FAST CHARGING is supported but the you need to buy a fast charger separately as the box contains only a 7.5W charger.

4. Processor: The thing I liked the most is the processor used by Samsung here...SD 662 which is far better than every other processor found in tablets in this price range. Things are butter smooth.

5. UI: One UI 2.5 is very well optimised for this tablet and the scrolling and stuff feels smooth.

6. Gaming: I tried Subway Surfers, PUBG Mobile and it felt really smooth. SO U CAN BUY THIS FOR CASUAL GAMING.

7. Buttons: I feel the power and volume buttons are little suppressed and they don't feel clickly.

8. Speakers: 4 speakers which are really really loud, probably the loudest ever I have heard on a Tablet.

9. Camera: Both cameras decent.Nothing special here.

Other Things:

1. Dolby Atmos support is there.

2. Headphone jack quality is good.

3. MicroSD card support is there.

PS: I bought the tablet for 17K with 2K cashback and 9 month no cost EMI.
So effective cost is 15K.

I think it is a great deal.; When it comes to budget tablets the choices are very less since no one except brand like Apple took this category to the next level. With that the prices went up as well and it made even harder for normal users to even consider using those devices and this is where Samsung totally nailed it.

Now, I know the specification may not look that attractive but you need to ask ask yourself few following questions-

No 1. Do you own a decent phone?
No 2. Are you looing for something which can be used for video, media consumption?
no 3. Are you low on budget?

If all your answers are YES then you are looking at the right product. Let me tell you one thing don't have any high expectations like doing intensive task , playing games etc. Whatever specification is provided is more then adequate for your daily activities. However, I did face some occasional frizz while using chrome on desktop mode but it gets the job done. I would have loved to see if Samsung provided better optimization for tabs like this. I have zero complains for it's hardware. It feels extremely well build. It has a modern look to it. The best part has to be it's display. Samsung has always been winner in this part. Even though it has an LCD display. Trust me you will not regrade it. In hand feeling is quite premium. The best thing about the tab is the aspect ratio. I have seen others using bigger and expensive tabs. Whenever I see them playing a video there is a thick black border which takes away the experience of having a high resolution big screen. In this tab it's quite minimal plus most videos plays full screen. It has a support for widevine l1. with quad speaker and superb battery. It takes the experience to the next level. Trust me when you buy this it will surely put a smile on your face. back camera is okyish. Nothing much to talk about. I don't thing the processor and RAM is a deal breaker anyway since we are talking about a TAB.
So, Do I recommend it?
The answer is obvious and a big YES. Totally value for money. Just go for it. .Wrote everything after using the tab personally for long time which puts me in a situation of writing this. Thank you..

Lastly, Thank you Amazon for quick delivery. You have done phenomenal job in this covid situation. Thank you..; Very decent design tab with bright screen visible in outdoor also, touch response is very nice, camera front and back is normal, image quality is not so good but decent in this price point, sound output is best in this price range, battery backup of tab is not so good but last upto 3 hours in continuous video playback, processing speed is decent no lag is there in usage for daily tasks. Built is best as it belongs to samsung. Definitely buy it.; I ordered for my 3 year old daughter who is attending nursery classes online, earlier I was using a laptop but it was a little difficult to use for a 3 year old kid, samsung tab A7 is a budget tab with good bright screen, good processor (snapdragon) very loud quad speaker, good front camera for video calls, main camera is avg of course of no use in tabs. Better life is good, with full charge you can attend 3-4 day class with light usages. Weight is normal, I used a tempered glass and a back cover which is after market.overall a good product at this price point, I got it at 15 k in offer of HDFC.
My requirement was SD processor, fast charging support, good big battery 7k amh, this tab fulfilled all.
One more thing although the tab support a fast charge of 15watt , it comes with a normal charger which is quite disappointing. I had a samsung mobile charger of 15 watt which I am using for it. 4/5 star over all."

You simply attach any Keyboard and Mouse over the Micro USB and it will act as a Mini Laptop.
The product is extremely sleek in design and handy to hold. The Metallic back gives it a premium look and feel.
Supports 128gb of memory card and can also be extended with the help on a OTG Pendrive.
The best part supports Dual Wifi Band (@2.4ghz and @5ghz) so you can a blazing fast speed.
No Simcard Facility.
The only con i feel is 5W Charger bundled in the box as it charges the tablet very slow, however i tried charging with A 10W charger and it charged pretty fast then a 5W.
It has very narrow bezles which makes it feel very handy, you feel holding a 7inch tablet instead a 8inch tablet in your hand that how sleek and handy it is.
A must buy product at Rs.9999/- for Day to Day minimalist Usage.
This product was tough to find. It did not show up in regular searches and only appeared when searching for ""2nd generation."" If you want an Android 10 tablet and don't need SIM calling, this is the tablet! I bought this for basic tasks: writing and Web surfing. For writing, I have purchased a Bluetooth keyboard and added a mouse. I do not play games so have no comment on that. The battery life is good and it took a couple of hours to charge fully. The Zoom app has some glitches with Android 10 but the web version works fine. Will update after a few more weeks of use.

Update after one month of use: I continue to be overall happy with this product. Video and audio quality is very good. Battery life is very good. I watched a full 45-minute YouTube video on 2% power without the tablet dying. Battery charging is fairly fast, especially if you turn off WiFi during charge. Word processing through Google Docs works fine. Zoom loads properly now on the app. The camera placement during call is not ideal. It always looks like I'm looking to the side instead of directly into the screen. It's the same problem when tablet is horizontal or vertical. Overall, happy with the purchase.; Good tablet under 6000. A little bit laggy sometimes but it is a good tab for video streaming with good display and sound quality. Serves the basic purposes like entertainment, reading e books and listening to music. Worth the buy if you have tight budget😃😃; I have been using the Lenovo Tab M8 HD Tablets for a few months now, and I am very impressed with its features and performance. This tablet is very sleek and lightweight, with a metal body and an 8-inch HD display. It has a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels, which delivers crisp and clear visuals. It also has an IPS panel, which offers wide viewing angles and vivid colors. The tablet is very powerful, as it has a MediaTek Helio A22 processor, which can handle multiple tasks and apps smoothly. It also has 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 128 GB with a microSD card. The tablet runs on Android 9 Pie, which is fast and user-friendly. It also has a long battery life, as it can last up to 18 hours on a single charge. The tablet is very versatile, as it has a Wi-Fi only connectivity, which allows me to browse the internet, stream videos, play games, and more. It also has a 5 MP rear camera and a 2 MP front camera, which are good for taking photos and video calls. It also has dual speakers with Dolby Audio, which provide rich and immersive sound. It also has a face unlock feature, which is convenient and secure. The tablet is also very affordable, compared to other tablets in the market. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone who wants a sleek and powerful tablet for their entertainment and productivity. It is a great product from Lenovo.; Very good product for this price; Screen quality for good, camera was as good. Battery backup was good.; Like the look; we brought two taps for kids, cant even handle one app at a time (youtube) , cant play games (normal one kids games).
its really laggy. not even fast enough, this sucks, i want to exchange this and buy new one before that i just want to give others review (idk there is exchange policy or not?); "

I ordered Pre booking. I got product late than those who ordered on first day. Also on day 1 there were free Amazon earbuds were provided to those who purchased. But nothing was provided to Pre-bookers. No point in pre-booking. Just avoid it.; Blazing performance, decent battery life and the complimentary keyboard is cherry on the top. Multi-tasking is so convenient on this tablet. Screen quality and sound quality are quite surprising. It's a total delight to watch movies on this, dialogues are crisp clear. Already planning to buy one more for my family members. Total value for money.; Good one suitable for this tab. Value for money.; The Honor Pad 9 is a perfect example of how not to make a tablet. Its performance is sluggish, making even basic tasks feel like a chore. The display is mediocre at best, with dull colors and poor brightness, making it nearly impossible to use outdoors. The build quality feels cheap and flimsy, like it would break if you looked at it too hard. The software is riddled with bloatware and outdated features that make you wonder if they even tried. If you’re looking for a tablet to frustrate you daily, the Honor Pad 9 is your best bet.; This's one of the best tab in category. The performance is super smooth, thanks to Gen 1 processor. The display is also good, far better than my Samsung s6 lite tab. Speakers are loud specially when you play on VLC player with 100% + volume. Camera quality is decent, unlock screen quickly. Despite large size, the weight of the tablet is light. 35 watt charging is decent, doesn't take too long to charge. Touch is very responsive. And the free keypad quality is superb, side hinges are made of metal, hold magnet is strong and keyboard feels premium quality. Overall I'm very satisfied with the tablet at this price point of view.; Very good specs and features.
Long battery. Screen with clarity.
Very user friendly.
Worth to buy.
Not a gaming person so can't comment in this aspect.
Free keyboard is big bonus in this budget.

Expecting a pencil also to make it complete set.; Overall performance is good with Battery, speakers, display, decent camera but don't expect any mobile camera quality.
The keyboard they provided is also of very nice quality and is overall good
Most importantly the sound, the 8speaker system with hires audio works really good
NOTE: Only flaw i encountered is it does not support other universal stylus for note taking., stylus option is available in note app but may be it supports only honor stylus(which is not available currently)if u want to use it for note taking... Wait for their stylus or u can use capacitive touch which is decent enough but not as good as a stylus pen"

Firstly, a big thanks to Amazon for hassle free exchange and delivery on time! And seller Appario retail once again has impressed me with their quality service.
Coming to the tablet, it's hands down the best there is at the budget range.
Screen- 8/10 As good as a TFT panel can be, bright enough and vibrant enough. It's no AMOLED but it's great. I didn't listen to the bad reviews, thankfully. There's no light bleed on my unit, as so many have said. Maybe they've fixed the issue. I had a Galaxy Tab 10.1 with a very good display. The contrast level is much better here. Viewing angles could have been little better though.
Processor- 8/10 I think nobody's buying this tablet to seriously pursue heavy gaming. For the regular user, the updated SD720G is a very snappy processor. No lags or jitters. I've worked with drawing apps and Rough Animator without any issues at all. RAM plus takes care of multitasking and app management.
Battery- good enough to last a day of use. Depends what kind of user you are, for average user it'll last more than a day. Expect SOT of 7-8 hrs at least! Just video streaming can last for 10-11 hrs at medium brightness!
S-PEN- 10/10 The reason why most people will be buying this tablet, and it will not disappoint. It takes the whole experience to a different level. Works like a charm, Samsung has fine tuned it over so many years. Worth it!
Software- 10/10 Samsung IS the most evolved Android UI there is at the moment. And they have optimised it for tablet. So many features like multi windows, gestures, air command and their integrated ecosystem and features like Samsung Dex work seamlessly for work user experience. Plus Samsung is exceptional nowadays with updates.
So my experience with this tablet is awesome and it's the best there is at this range. Period. Some other manufacturers like Lenovo,Realme etc may seemingly give you more bang for the same cost. But nothing can match the overall experience.
Overall 8.5/10
Value for money- 10/10 as the s-pen is included!; I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite during a great summer offer, and at the price of 14k, it's hard to find fault with. It's an ideal choice for professionals needing it for office use, students looking to take notes, and beginner artists.

In terms of performance, I found it to be quite efficient for everyday tasks. However, at its regular pricing, I would complain that it shows some lag when multitasking. The sound quality is good, but it could be louder for a more immersive entertainment experience. Overall, considering its current price, the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a worthwhile investment for those seeking a versatile and affordable tablet; If you are a student or a working professional and need to take notes or create slides, this is what you need. Value for money and under 25k budget this is the best buy.
Fast charging. Screen size is quite good to watch youtube videos, with a quite decent RAM it provides smoothness. And my favourite part is the pen.; Love this tablet, it isn't super powerful like my phone but it's still more fun to use the tablet, and the S pen it's fantastic; S pen working very well.overall satisfied with it performance. camera quality is not too good, overall I can say in this price range good tablet; The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a great tablet for students who are looking for a device that can handle both study and productivity tasks. It comes with an S Pen stylus that is included in the box, which makes it easy to take notes, draw, and annotate documents. The stylus also attaches magnetically to the side of the tablet, so you don't have to worry about losing it.

The tablet has a 10.4-inch TFT display that is bright and sharp, with good viewing angles and colors. The screen size is ideal for watching videos, reading e-books, and browsing the web. The tablet also has dual speakers that are tuned by AKG, which deliver clear and loud sound quality.

The tablet is powered by an snapdragon processor, which is capable of handling most apps and games smoothly. The tablet also has 4GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of internal storage, which can be expanded with a microSD card. The battery life is impressive, as the tablet can last for up to 12 hours of video playback on a single charge.

The tablet has a sleek and premium design, with a metal back and thin bezels. It is available in three colors: Angora Blue, Oxford Gray, and Chiffon Pink. The tablet is also lightweight and slim, making it easy to carry around.

The tablet runs on Android 13 with One UI on top, which offers a lot of customization options and features. The tablet also supports Samsung DeX mode, which allows you to connect the tablet to a monitor or TV and use it as a desktop PC. The tablet also has some useful apps pre-installed, such as Samsung Notes, Samsung Kids, and Netflix.

The only drawbacks of the tablet are that it does not have an AMOLED display, which would have offered better contrast and colors; it does not have a fingerprint scanner or face unlock, which would have made it more secure; and it does not have a keyboard cover accessory, which would have made it more productive. The s Pen is the magic wand 🪄 but it's tip got damaged only after 4 days of use....

Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a fantastic tablet for students who want a versatile device that can handle both study and productivity tasks. It offers a good display, a powerful performance, a long battery life, a premium design, and an S Pen stylus that is included in the box. It is also priced reasonably compared to other tablets in the market. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is definitely a must-buy for students who are looking for a tablet that can do it all.
