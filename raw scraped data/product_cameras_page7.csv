I wanted to buy a camera that is not expensive like A7s3 but still gives out amazing results and I'm happy I got this one as if custom built for me. This is the one. Very good low light performance as well. I give it 5 stars.; This is my first DSLR camera. Did lot of research before buying this as this was a huge investment.
I felt the image has more natural colors and I especially like the controls they provide for manual adjustments. Find some of the first pics that I have taken from this camera.; Man what a camera. A much needed upgrade from entry level to a pro grade level camera. Although not that pro but still works like a pro. Fuji did awesome job creating this timeless design into a masterpiece. Camera is great so does the UI, but lenses are costly.; Excellent!; It's been 1 month I have been using XT-4,
User interface is intuitive, picture quality is top class.
Color are obviously awesome 🙂
Gives a solid well built feel.
Buttons and dials are fun to use ...
Also the camera is very responsive...the settings etc etc; Waiting for the replacement unit. The camera has a really good design. It's not very light weight. Can feel the solid metal built. It did overheat during 4k recording for more than 20 min. Could be a faulty unit. I'll update the review after receiving the replacement and testing. ✨

Update : Don't buy expensive products from amazon. They rejected the replacement blindly. I'm now stuck with the product. Buy from a local store. The delivery boy called and told he can't make the replacement on the day promised and reported on amazon saying the item is broken during their transit. And I'm no longer eligible for replacement. Their fault and they're denying our rights. Woww...what a policy from amazon. When i asked for refund I'm told the return period is over. All because of their fault. The seller was appario. I don't know if it's their fault. Sounds like scam from both Amazon's and seller's end. I'm totally disappointed.

They've lost a prime member and all the people in my contact atleast from purchasing on amazon; Está es la opinión del que la está usando.
Fue un regalo; Soy usuario de Fujifilm y creo que lo seguiré siendo en lo futuro. La calidad de imagen que me brindan sus archivos es inmejorable desde mi punto de vista. El diseño estético de sus equipos invita a salir a la calle, a la playa, al bosque a hacer fotografías, a divertirse; en fin, de eso se trata la vida.; Excelente desempeño y construcción. Definitivamente es la mejor apsc que he tenido, inclusive más que la D500 de Nikon.

Su estilo retro y tamaño, invitan a llevarse a todos lados.

Algo es cierto, no extrañaré el tamaño de las reflex con esta maravillosa inversión.; Después de buscar en diferentes tiendas fue la mejor oferta de compra, producto original y llego en perfecto estado.; Beautiful camera. I chose silver. It looks particularly nice and retro. No matter what the online reviews state, this is a solid and beautifully-made camera. The instruction book is 338 pages long in English. The lens is superb. It is solid cold metal, with a wonderfully positive and smooth action. The viewfinder is like a full-frame SLR. The camera is heavy and solid. Altogether, I find it a beauty of a camera, and full-metal-jacket. I didn't know they made cameras like this any more. I have Nikon and Olympus, but they are reliable, reliable, reliable! Have not had a chance to use the Fujifilm yet, but it looks gorgeous!"

Since this is my first mirrorless and venturing from Canon, I chose this over the 7M3..
The Color in the pictures is mind blowing, the Eterna film pass if closest to the old film movie camera, and there are tons of features to go on and on with; you can directly put the jpeg from camera to insta without much edit/s.
It is a small mini computer and if you put some time, you can customize the entire thing to your liking.
Small, beautiful, light-weight; and that old film camera vibe.. Perfect.. Makes you wanna go out n take pictures and explore your creativity..; This is a world renowned and proven camera in the fields. Used by many professionals. I am using this as a second camera for my Fujifilm GFX 100 camera. The kit lens is of professional quality and renders good contrast, resolution and colours. It can be used in weddings, Landscapes, portraits etc., almost in all fields; The best camera in APSC. Stays at par with full frame or even exceeds it. Value for money can never be better than this. I wanted to buy a camera that is not expensive like A7s3 but still gives out amazing results and I'm happy I got this one as if custom built for me. This is the one. Very good low light performance as well. I give it 5 stars.; This is my first DSLR camera. Did lot of research before buying this as this was a huge investment.
I felt the image has more natural colors and I especially like the controls they provide for manual adjustments. Find some of the first pics that I have taken from this camera.; Man what a camera. A much needed upgrade from entry level to a pro grade level camera. Although not that pro but still works like a pro. Fuji did awesome job creating this timeless design into a masterpiece. Camera is great so does the UI, but lenses are costly.; Excellent!; It's been 1 month I have been using XT-4,
User interface is intuitive, picture quality is top class.
Color are obviously awesome 🙂
Gives a solid well built feel.
Buttons and dials are fun to use ...
Also the camera is very responsive...the settings etc etc; Waiting for the replacement unit. The camera has a really good design. It's not very light weight. Can feel the solid metal built. It did overheat during 4k recording for more than 20 min. Could be a faulty unit. I'll update the review after receiving the replacement and testing. ✨

Update : Don't buy expensive products from amazon. They rejected the replacement blindly. I'm now stuck with the product. Buy from a local store. The delivery boy called and told he can't make the replacement on the day promised and reported on amazon saying the item is broken during their transit. And I'm no longer eligible for replacement. Their fault and they're denying our rights. Woww...what a policy from amazon. When i asked for refund I'm told the return period is over. All because of their fault. The seller was appario. I don't know if it's their fault. Sounds like scam from both Amazon's and seller's end. I'm totally disappointed.

They've lost a prime member and all the people in my contact atleast from purchasing on amazon; Está es la opinión del que la está usando.
Fue un regalo; Soy usuario de Fujifilm y creo que lo seguiré siendo en lo futuro. La calidad de imagen que me brindan sus archivos es inmejorable desde mi punto de vista. El diseño estético de sus equipos invita a salir a la calle, a la playa, al bosque a hacer fotografías, a divertirse; en fin, de eso se trata la vida.; Excelente desempeño y construcción. Definitivamente es la mejor apsc que he tenido, inclusive más que la D500 de Nikon.

Su estilo retro y tamaño, invitan a llevarse a todos lados.

Algo es cierto, no extrañaré el tamaño de las reflex con esta maravillosa inversión.; Después de buscar en diferentes tiendas fue la mejor oferta de compra, producto original y llego en perfecto estado.; Beautiful camera. I chose silver. It looks particularly nice and retro. No matter what the online reviews state, this is a solid and beautifully-made camera. The instruction book is 338 pages long in English. The lens is superb. It is solid cold metal, with a wonderfully positive and smooth action. The viewfinder is like a full-frame SLR. The camera is heavy and solid. Altogether, I find it a beauty of a camera, and full-metal-jacket. I didn't know they made cameras like this any more. I have Nikon and Olympus, but they are reliable, reliable, reliable! Have not had a chance to use the Fujifilm yet, but it looks gorgeous!"

Solid for photography especially wildlife as it has fast autofocus system and a reliable metering system from the flagship dx camera d500.; Black spot in Eye View Finder.; Not perfect when we have mirror less cameras; Cumple su función, es una cámara muy buena, el envío fue rapidísimo; D7500 is an excellent camera that delivers excellent value. It has features that are very useful for enthusiast and amteauers alike.; Máquina atualizada e de grande capacidade com a utilização de vários recursos. Fácil de utilizar, entendo ter sido uma excelente compra.; Excellent camera. This camera is not for beginners, it does have a learning curve. That said the features are amazing. The photos are sharp and clear; Just a short review, more of a user experience. I bought the D7500 for a month long trip to Europe. I was replacing a D7100 that had some nagging problems that often left me less than satisfied (It had been dropped - and repaired - early in its life, but was never as good as I expected). Anyway, I filled 4-5 64 Gig memory cards on the trip, and I have to say that this camera is far better than my old one. The low light abilities are awesome, and on the few instances where I needed to take a picture hand held in low light with some depth of field, ISO 16000 was a very viable option. Not noise free, but better than ISO 6400 on the older camera. Other features that made the user experience better: I could easily transfer pictures to my phone - very important to my wife and convenient for sharing or posting to Facebook when traveling without a computer. The connection to the phone also meant that I could share the phone's GPS with the camera and therefore get location tags on every photo. This worked very well, though it is possible that it negatively affects the phone's battery - but my phone is old and it is hard to really tell. (I think the automatic download was more detrimental to the phone battery, and it took a little searching to figure out how to turn off automatic downloads for every photo). As for the camera battery, it was also good, though again, the automatic download seemed to affect it a lot, as did a lot of activity on the display. The tilting screen was useful to have, but not as useful as a fully articulating screen (like the D5300). The touch screen was awesome, and made it VERY easy to check critical focus and work with the menu - even with gloves on. I was in a cold weather environment, so I had gloves on much of the time. These gloves had something on each finger that would let it work with an iPhone, and therefore it worked just as well with he camera. I liked the feature where you could use the live preview and touch the screen where you wanted it to be in focus, and it would refocus and take the shot.

I understand why people complain about the missing second SD slot, but as long as I carried a second card around, it was fine. I never made automatic backups anyway, and I can live without putting RAW on one card and JPG on the other. It would have been nice, but the other features are more important to me. The depth of field preview seems to be gone, and that is disappointing, but it is usually easy enough to take a shot and check depth of field and then take another. The exposure settings were a little more confusing to me, and I could not reliably determine if the camera tended to over or underexpose. I think I ended up using plus or minus 1/3 of a stop a lot of the time, and sometimes a lot more than that.

Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. I might change my mind after reviewing the thousands of photos I took on the trip, but based on what I have seen, it is a definite upgrade!!"

Unable to save the photos to storage. Will go into the trash as it is usless!
Will have to look for a cammera that formats in eXfat.; Decent camera.I can not remove the tf card.It was already in the slot and it wont come out.; I was just looking for a camera for occasional use, with my job and occasionally on vacations. However I've found that with having one, there's a lot of times where I just want to capture a quick picture or video. Or even just a solution to a problem or to remember something written down and reference it later. It fits really well in my hand, the features are coinvent and easy to use. I was really surprised at how well it performed and the ability to charge the removable batteries in the device itself was very coinvent. If i ever get a second camera to take pictures of the first I'll add some to the review haha.; I was looking for travel and nature camera that I could carry in my pocket that was capable of taking decent photos. This camera was certainly small enough but the quality of the pictures was not good unless you were taking one of a stationary object within 10 feet of you. Also, the manual that came with the camera was a joke."

Size is 86mm×54mm; Good 😊; Suggested better not to buy this product mainly from Amazon .....; Got it as a gift for my friend. It clicks on good pictures indoor but outdoor it fails horribly. Also it fails to focus properly more often than not.; Good product; A câmera é linda! As fotos ficam incríveis! O produto chegou antes do prazo!; Amei perfeita dms e linda vem com as pilhas dentro da caixinha.; A câmera é linda e muito boa,funciona cumpri com o que promete nota 10
Adorei!!!!; Muy buen producto, fotos muy bonitas para capturar los grandes instantes en el momento. La única área de oportunidad es que todavía funciona con pilas y que el flash siempre se activa aunque haya buena exposición de luz, si se pudiera activar/desactivar el flash a discreción estaría mejor. Además, la calidad de las fotos está sujeta a la marca de pilas que se usen; se recomienda cambiar las que ya trae incluidas por unas Duracell.; Ela é linda, levinha, bem fácil de usar. Vale super a pena, a única parte ruim é o preço dos filmes mesmo kkkkkkkk (e ainda acabei usando um a toa porque tirei foto do chão sem querer), mas super vale a experiência e o carinho de guardar momentos em fotos reveladas!!!"

It comes with an SD card and 2 batteries and comes with a charger and a transfer charger so you can easily send pictures from your computer to your phone! Within seconds! This is truly an amazing camera and Id highly recommend I always stray away from cameras because they are hard to use but this is very easy to use and it has instructions too.; This is a great camera for pictures and the video sound is amazing. It was either not compatible with my laptop or the camera itself couldn't transfer videos. I couldn't view any of the videos so I'm returning. If you're looking for a basic starter camera this is for you. It takes amazing pictures but I just needed video too; Battery did not easily install into the battery compartment, either due to the Lithium battery being defective or due to the battery compartment being improperly designed. The battery was stuck in place and I had a difficult time removing it in order to return the camera to Amazon. The battery is a critical component of this camera and the fact that the battery did not fit easily into the battery compartment could be an indicator of future problems that could occur. The fact that the Lithium battery did not fit properly into the battery compartment could also be an potential fire hazard if proper contact is not being made during the charging process. I was not willing to take this chance, so I returned the camera to Amazon.; Bought this for my younger nephew who has been dabbling in vlogging, but using his phone camera was not cutting it since he needed his phone at the same time for monitoring. He's been enjoying this camera. The quality is nowhere near a professional DSLR but then again for the price, this is absolutely perfect for his needs. This package came with everything you need to get started... From the MicroSD card to the charger and even a drawstring carrying pouch.

As for the photo/video quality, he was happy with it. Again, don't expect the color depth, vibrance, or details of a professional-grade DSLR. You're getting a BIG bang for your buck."

Bei vielen anderen Sofortbildkameras geht es nur um die Momentaufnahme - bei der mini 99 jedoch gibt es viele kleine Feinheiten, die beim Fotografieren richtig Spaß machen.
Sie ist optisch ein richtiger Blickfang und fühlt sich dazu auch sehr hochwertig an. Durch die verschiedenen Einstellräder oder das verstellbare Objektiv hat man ein richtiges analoges Bediengefühl.
Ich bin ein großer Fan von den Farbeffekten. Hiermit sieht jedes Sofortbild nach etwas besonderem aus, egal wie einfach das Motiv war.
Von der Qualität der Bilder bin ich ebenfalls sehr begeistert.
Diese Sofortbildkamera ist wirklich für jeden geeignet. Fotografen, die ein wenig mit Funkionen, wie Langzeitbelichtung oder Doppelbelichtung, spielen möchten, aber auch für ""Anfänger"", da die Standardeinstellungen schon tolle Bilder liefern!; J'adore la photo et j'ai globalement suivi l'évolution du marché depuis le milieu des années 90 : les appareils argentiques jetables de mon enfance, les compacts numériques, une montée en gamme en passant au bridge puis au reflex, sans compter les smartphones toujours plus performants. Résultat : des milliers, peut-être des dizaines de milliers de photos qui dorment dans des disques durs, des clés usb... et que je ne regarde jamais ou presque.

L'instax, malgré son aspect plastique cheap en main, malgré ses caractéristiques médiocres sur le papier (un 60 mm f/12,7) procure le plaisir unique de l'instantané et de la photo qui se dessine peu à peu sous vos yeux. Elle devient tout de suite un objet tangible qui crée du lien, et même une émotion liée à son imperfection (à la manière d'un vinyle). Car le but n'est pas d'égaler la précision des appareils numériques mais de créer des photos plus authentiques, dans un style très vintage. Les maniaques du piqué, passez votre chemin : oui il y aura du flou, de la surexposition, des photos complètement loupées... mais c'est aussi le jeu. Et ce doit être compliqué pour quelqu'un qui n'a jamais connu l'argentique. Il faut vraiment gérer la lumière et ne pas chercher des compositions trop compliquées avec de trop fortes dynamiques : c'est voué à l'échec. Mais on apprend et si on se fait avoir au début, on sort ensuite des clichés plus satisfaisants avec beaucoup de charme.

De plus, l'instax mini 99 constitue une évolution par rapport aux autres modèles et propose un peu plus de contrôle sur les photos : les filtres de couleur, le réglage de la luminosité, le vignetage, 3 niveaux de mise au point, le contrôle du flash, plusieurs modes (intérieur, sport, double exposition, bulb). Cela décuple les possibilités créatives !

Bref, oubliez la technique trop compliquée, oubliez les smartphones qui corrigent trop et profitez d'un appareil à mi-chemin entre la tradition et la modernité qui vous redonnera le sourire.; Vraiment un immense plaisir à utiliser !; it is easy to use，vantage style. but It doesn't look as good as the Mini 90. The improvement over the Mini 90 is not significant, and the price might be a bit high. Personally, I think a reasonable price for this machine would be around $150.; The newest of Fuji's Instax range the 99 is a big bulky camera that uses the standard Instax film (it doesn't come with any film so I bought a pack for use with the camera). As with other Instax cameras it doesn't offer the option to print borderless unlike the Kodak Mini Shot range. It features macro & landscape capabilities (accessed by turning the lens) as well light/darkness compensation. I didn't use the camera with the App as I feel the camera should be able to do what I want in camera. The advertising tends to emphasise the novelty features (colour effects, vignetting etc) .
Having tried it on macro I found that when using flash it would focus past the subject. Without flash it struggled with image definition and tended to wash out details.
When taking shots outside (see attached photograph) it struggled with definition and contrast. The first of the three photos was taken on ""N"" and then using the light/darkness compensation dial for the last two. The shots are either too bright or too dark (the sun was behind and to the side).
Overall picture quality is variable (out of twenty shots there wasn't one that was particularly good), the camera build is plastic and bulky and I feel is overpriced."

Produces good colors; Print quality is very good with photos taken from mobile..but camer inbuilt camera is not that good; Rather than looking at it as a camera printer, consider it a printer camera. Because you may not be using the camera as often due to inherent limitations of instant cameras.; The product stopped working in 2 months; I was confused between Kodak and Fujifilm but ended up taking this and am very satisfied. My reasons for purchase were:
1. Brand image
2. Amazing process of printing
3. Best option in this price range
4. Lower cost of film roll compared to Fujifilm; I bought it for my anniversary picture and I am very happy with the product.The ease of access and the print quality is good.Only thing which can be improved is Kodak can give a larger screen and it becomes difficult to guess the exact background.
Pros-Photo filter for variation in photography,Can be paired with mobile and act as a printer,laminated insta pictures for better longer life
Cons-LCD screen size and quality can be improved,Little bit heavy
My verdict-One of the best insta camera.; Picture quality is not that great. Better with mobile photos. Easy & fun to use.; I actually buy this camera due to good review about picture quality but in actual print quality of photo very bad not as expected. Genuinely I feel like it's a waste of money...; Ótimo produto; During the year of use, I took 40 photos, some of them were spoiled by the camera, but in general, it is a very wonderful thing that will bring you a lot of good emotions.; Me agrada que no solo cumple con tomar fotos sino como una impresora de ellas, y de muy buena calidad.

Most smartphones nowadays retail for nearly $1,000 in total, and a key element in their advertising is not only the quality of the built in cameras but the constant improves from model to model. Of course, a smart phone camera is going to produce better quality pictures. It's one of the reasons we spend our hard earned money on them. If all we needed was a device to call and text, we'd still be using flip phones. Let's put our thinking caps on and remember why the little computers in our pockets can take excellent if not astounding quality pictures - because they're built to!

Now, this Kodak camera does state it prints ""superior photo"" quality, but it does not boast ""state of the art"" quality or even ""smart phone"" quality, because it knows its place and that would be a flat out lie. Read the fine print, people! Superior does not automatically equate to breathtaking, especially when you look at the product itself. Once again, this is a basic camera/tool. It is not built to be an equal to a smartphone which is essentially, as I said, a mini-computer; It is not built to be an equal to even the lowest tier of professional photography cameras. It IS however, built to be a simple, basic photo taking device that you can also connect to your phone, iPad or other supported device if you choose to.

It does what it says on the box, so I am happy with this purchase. I suspect other customers were expecting something far more complex and souped up, and that is not what this camera is.

Now, the only cons I have for it is that printing process is a little slow, but it takes less than a minute. The paper quality is good though, so I'll let this slide. You can't have everything, especially if you're buying something that is quite budget when it comes to bells and whistles. And that's another thing I'd like to mention - this prints on modern day photo paper. Do not expect the thick, flimsy paper that actual polaroid cameras printed on. If that's what you're after, then you'll be better off heading over to eBay or a pawn shop.

Don’t think twice and buy it. It’s really worth it. I can just print whichever pic that I took long back. It looks classy and very handy. Love it; It’s a great in-between a digital camera and a old time polaroid. It actually reminiscence early 2000s more then the 80’s though.. but it’s also great for saving some money on film, which is pretty expensive. The Wi-Fi feature is also great. Now you can also have physical copies of your old pictures.; Very cool and fun thing. Mostly we use it like a printer for printing pictures from phone. Very cute device!; ; The camera is easy to use the print out are not rich and would look washed out.
Though instant photo has its charm, I would recommend to go for less expensive options from.
Very expensive per photo cost but that would be same across the board.; when i receive product and i try to start camera there is no battery,then i charged and again try to start but there is no start up screen, in bluetooth setting already one device already paired ....i ordered brand new camera but i received used product; After replacing the item as it wasn't working (not able to print the pictures). After I replaced the item, again same thing is happening. Ot clocks the pictures but unable to print and also eating my films. Preety disappointed by the quality of the camera.; Bought this from nearby camera store, bad color reproduction, too costly at 19k, just a piece of toy. Dont waste money on this"

This is truly an amazing camera and Id highly recommend I always stray away from cameras because they are hard to use but this is very easy to use and it has instructions too.; This is a great camera for pictures and the video sound is amazing. It was either not compatible with my laptop or the camera itself couldn't transfer videos. I couldn't view any of the videos so I'm returning. If you're looking for a basic starter camera this is for you. It takes amazing pictures but I just needed video too; Battery did not easily install into the battery compartment, either due to the Lithium battery being defective or due to the battery compartment being improperly designed. The battery was stuck in place and I had a difficult time removing it in order to return the camera to Amazon. The battery is a critical component of this camera and the fact that the battery did not fit easily into the battery compartment could be an indicator of future problems that could occur. The fact that the Lithium battery did not fit properly into the battery compartment could also be an potential fire hazard if proper contact is not being made during the charging process. I was not willing to take this chance, so I returned the camera to Amazon.; Bought this for my younger nephew who has been dabbling in vlogging, but using his phone camera was not cutting it since he needed his phone at the same time for monitoring. He's been enjoying this camera. The quality is nowhere near a professional DSLR but then again for the price, this is absolutely perfect for his needs. This package came with everything you need to get started... From the MicroSD card to the charger and even a drawstring carrying pouch.

As for the photo/video quality, he was happy with it. Again, don't expect the color depth, vibrance, or details of a professional-grade DSLR. You're getting a BIG bang for your buck."

But there aren't good f/2.8lens for ef-s with f/2.8 in all focal length ranges and ef lenses have a crop of 1.6 factor.
Anyway the af works seamlessly in photos and videos. But the iso performance isn't that great of an upgrade compared to my older 60D, or even worst in some shots especially in high shutter speed, high iso in photos. But the af is spot on and ease of use is unbelievable.. U can change and see settings in multiple ways.. Using tough screen, using all the control wheels, using top small lcd screen, using q button + joystick.. Want more? Need to try out all of them in different scenario to make a decision on which is faster, but with initial experience, all are fast and its a hard decision.
The ergonomics is always great and similar to my older 60D with some minute improvements. You won't be able to feel the weight reduction from 60/70/80D. For me, that's a good thing and have a solid feel.. Havn't tested the weather sealing capabilities. Hope I wouldn't have to torture it anytime soon. Though it boasts to withstands such tortures, I dont trust its ruggedness as much compared to a 7D mii.
4K is nice, but indoor medium to low light and especially under LED and LED tube light, the flicker warning will be shown always and the noise levels aren't great even though the colours and focus is amazing. Noise levels in indoor lighting is worse than my poco f1 indoor videos. Stabilization is decent though not in same league as a gopro hero 8 black with hypersmooth, even with IS on.. I know it lacks IBIS, and no cannon has it ATM.
Anyway simply the best crop sensor canon or any crop sensor cam. Really wished it has the 65 af points from 7D mii. Anyway the af speed is as good or even faster, and live view just obliterates the 7dmii af system. Really wish canon brings 65 af points though a firmware update.. But chances are less as the hardware system is different.

Anyway a good investment.. Sad canon has announced to stop producing EF lens. Hope they restart since they just recently announced 1DX miii and do they want to kill it before its even officially realised?? Its believed to be the king of all Dslrs and mirrorless alike.
Canon.. Please listen to our call and restart production of all EF lenses if you care.

Edit:
About the noise, I was wrong. Initially felt the noise in photos in higher iso is bit higher than older gens like 80/70D. But if you zoom in pixel-peep into the pics, you can see some type of correction has been performed in the noise, and it looks much less like nos and blends with the background color. That will have a good impact n prints or when viewed on large high res screens.
Also I am loving its AF capabilities and faster bursts. I am not missing any moments and every shot is in focus, especially in Live view. The bundled 18-135 is magnificent in focusing speed and accuracy, compared to older 18-135 (which I own and planning to sell off now). Its dead silent and super fast AF in photos or video odes.; product is Dope; It ticks almost all the boxes.; Camera is excellent, There is a significant learning curve. Need to good lens to get extraordinary pictures. Liveview mode is awesome. It can work as mirroless too. All over a great allrounder.

*Need good lenses to get good pictures because of it's 32 megap sensor; Edit: Buy body only unless you need this travel lens.
I bought the camera from a local canon store. Amazing performance with 18-135 combination. It is one of the best cameras anyone can buy without hesitation.
Cons
- 18-135mm performs far better on 80D than 90D ( Better shoot outdoors with enough light)
- In low light Iso above 1600 is noisy with the 18-135 lens but the 80D got better image quality even at 2500 iso. 90D has more Megapixel but fails in low light when compared with 80D
- Lacks ALL-I video processing
- 120fps No Auto Focus & No stabilization; Love the camera. The detailing is amazing. 32MP, is great for landscape and wildlife photography. Works well the 18-135mm USM IS lens. Possibly a strong competition to expensive full frame mirrorless cameras, with extended range of affordable lens options.; I had been using canon1200D since 5 years and suddenly planned to buy canon 90D after reviewing this product. Extremely smooth performance. Video quality is also exclusive among all APS-C cameras. One of the best camera with better upgradation has been launched by canon.; This Dslr is extremely beutifully designed and a crystal clear picture camera and depends on person using it; Free SD 64gb is missing from the package
Pls send; This is an upgrade from a ~10 year old EOS of similar quality as my old EOS was pre Bluetooth/Wi-fi. The convenience of linking the camera to the mobile and other improved features over that time were well worth the upgrade.; I love love my new 90d. Got delivered in 2 days in Sydney from amazon AU. I used the amazon locker for delivery and that was super quick and convenient.
I was unsure to buy from Amazon because I didn't see any reviews from amazon au customers. In addition amazon is offering the camera in around $250 less than other retailers. Hence I am dropping a review here for my fellows in Australia to go for it please.
I am the happiest with my first dslr camera.; Well i have been eyeing this Camera off for over 6 months! at Harvey Norman for $2400 but could not bring myself to buying it at this cost! well Low and behold it was $900 cheaper on Amazon could not Click pass it its a great unit looking forward to opening up and exploring all its full use; I love love love 😄 my 90d with 135mm lenses. If you’re not using flash photography don’t buy any kit lenses. Only buy camera body and search for second hand or new one prime lenses. The cost will be same amount."

Don’t think twice and buy it. It’s really worth it. I can just print whichever pic that I took long back. It looks classy and very handy. Love it; It’s a great in-between a digital camera and a old time polaroid. It actually reminiscence early 2000s more then the 80’s though.. but it’s also great for saving some money on film, which is pretty expensive. The Wi-Fi feature is also great. Now you can also have physical copies of your old pictures.; Very cool and fun thing. Mostly we use it like a printer for printing pictures from phone. Very cute device!; ; The camera is easy to use the print out are not rich and would look washed out.
Though instant photo has its charm, I would recommend to go for less expensive options from.

When I transferred the footage from the MicroSD card directly into the computer, all the videos were jittery and laggy including the ones with 4K 30fps, 1080p 30fps ones too. After a lot of experimentation, found out that the videos have to be downloaded into the mobile through the XDV Pro app. Then if I transfer the file into the computer, it plays normally and the video works well. Strangely both the file sizes match byte to byte but only the one transferred through the XDV Pro app plays well.

Not sure what the issue is.

Produces good colors; Print quality is very good with photos taken from mobile..but camer inbuilt camera is not that good; Rather than looking at it as a camera printer, consider it a printer camera. Because you may not be using the camera as often due to inherent limitations of instant cameras.; The product stopped working in 2 months; I was confused between Kodak and Fujifilm but ended up taking this and am very satisfied. My reasons for purchase were:
1. Brand image
2. Amazing process of printing
3. Best option in this price range
4. Lower cost of film roll compared to Fujifilm; I bought it for my anniversary picture and I am very happy with the product.The ease of access and the print quality is good.Only thing which can be improved is Kodak can give a larger screen and it becomes difficult to guess the exact background.
Pros-Photo filter for variation in photography,Can be paired with mobile and act as a printer,laminated insta pictures for better longer life
Cons-LCD screen size and quality can be improved,Little bit heavy
My verdict-One of the best insta camera.; Picture quality is not that great. Better with mobile photos. Easy & fun to use.; I actually buy this camera due to good review about picture quality but in actual print quality of photo very bad not as expected. Genuinely I feel like it's a waste of money...; Ótimo produto; During the year of use, I took 40 photos, some of them were spoiled by the camera, but in general, it is a very wonderful thing that will bring you a lot of good emotions.; Me agrada que no solo cumple con tomar fotos sino como una impresora de ellas, y de muy buena calidad.
La autonomía de la batería queda un poco corta pero sigue siendo un gran producto, solo tengan cuidado cuando inserten los cartuchos ya que se puede arruinar el mismo.; I rarely write reviews, but upon purchasing and using this product and seeing the onslaught of negative reviews, I had to sit down and type one out.

First, I do not understand the negative reviews. Maybe some critical thinking skills aren't being applied when others have bought this product. You see lots of ""My iPhone/Android camera takes better quality pictures!"" in the complaints. Let's dissect this. Most smartphones nowadays retail for nearly $1,000 in total, and a key element in their advertising is not only the quality of the built in cameras but the constant improves from model to model. Of course, a smart phone camera is going to produce better quality pictures. It's one of the reasons we spend our hard earned money on them. If all we needed was a device to call and text, we'd still be using flip phones. Let's put our thinking caps on and remember why the little computers in our pockets can take excellent if not astounding quality pictures - because they're built to!

Now, this Kodak camera does state it prints ""superior photo"" quality, but it does not boast ""state of the art"" quality or even ""smart phone"" quality, because it knows its place and that would be a flat out lie. Read the fine print, people! Superior does not automatically equate to breathtaking, especially when you look at the product itself. Once again, this is a basic camera/tool. It is not built to be an equal to a smartphone which is essentially, as I said, a mini-computer; It is not built to be an equal to even the lowest tier of professional photography cameras. It IS however, built to be a simple, basic photo taking device that you can also connect to your phone, iPad or other supported device if you choose to.

It does what it says on the box, so I am happy with this purchase. I suspect other customers were expecting something far more complex and souped up, and that is not what this camera is.

Now, the only cons I have for it is that printing process is a little slow, but it takes less than a minute. The paper quality is good though, so I'll let this slide. You can't have everything, especially if you're buying something that is quite budget when it comes to bells and whistles. And that's another thing I'd like to mention - this prints on modern day photo paper. Do not expect the thick, flimsy paper that actual polaroid cameras printed on. If that's what you're after, then you'll be better off heading over to eBay or a pawn shop.

This is a modern take on an old school favorite. Understand what you're buying, and you will be a satisfied customer.; La calidad de las fotos es muy buena y el tamaño es suficientemente grande, a diferencia de otras cámaras instantaneas que te imprimen como mucho tamaño similar al de una foto de carnet. Las funciones que tiene son bastante básicas, pero si lo que buscas es la simplicidad y facilidad de uso de las cámaras instantaneas retro no te hara falta más. Las impresiones son económicas y de buena calidad. Alternativamente con la App de Kodak en el móvil puedes imprimir fotos de la cámara del móvil con todos los filtros y retoques necesarios como si fuese una impresora bluetooth. Ante un apuro también sirve para imprimir un par de fotos de carnet por impresión, eso sí, tendrás que ver que salgan a la escala correcta para que coincidan con el tamaño carnet. No tiene memoria, únicamente puedes imprimir o descartar la foto, para eso mejor usar el móvil y usarla como impresora. A los niños les encanta por ser sencilla de usar y poder ver la foto impresa físicamente. Resulta recomendable comprarle una funda para llevar la cámara y algún recambio de fotos."

I liked the product but the cartridge inside the camera was stuck when i took out the first print and hence entire cartridge got ruined. Can u send me a replacement cartridge only?; ; Away from this digital world where we can easily delete the pictures I always wanted a mini Polaroid camera to click and create amazing moments and memories and print instantly... And this camera is something which i loved and wanted from a long time... The compact looks and a good quality instant print adds a lot of value for the money that we spend... Thanks Kodak for making such a wonderful product... Loved using it!; DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT VERY VERY BAD QUALITY WASTE OF MONEY

++ I have been using instant cameras for a while hence choose Kodak in India as the photo sheets were easily available but that was a mistake

++ pathetic picture quality - I choose two of these kodak cameras as gifts to my nieces and now m so embarrassed as when they clicked pictures ( in day light and night ) I saw the horrible quality product which i got them as gift.

++The product is well build but do not go by pictures on the site its misleading \\

++ I cannot get my money refunded as they do not have return policy - of course why ...since they are selling a bad product; ; As the product is superb in quality of printing pictures, but the camera pixels is very low and the most disappointing thing is its battery backup. I can't print more than 5 photos in one full charge and even the camera is draining the battery when it is not in use; Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing device but if you have a phone with a decent camera you should buy the Kodak 4 pass mini printer instead as you'll never end up using the camera aspect of this camera.; It’s fun to use and I’ve printed many photos as I’ve purchased extra cartridges. The camera is the printer is not good and I’ve used existing photos from iPhone but it is not that clear and tends to pixelate the photo. To have a better result, use the Kodak app by sharpening the photo to 10 and making it a bit brighter. Still the outline of the subject is not that defined. Overall it’s fun but it lacks quality unlike the YouTube reviews. Maybe I got a bad product.; Very important to mention what I've called a quasi instant functionality. Unlike real instant cameras where you can make unintentional clicks and accidental photos (and even when it is intentional - it is not always what you've expected), here you are prevented from that. You are taking the picture, see the intermediate result on a tiny screen and only then you can print it if you want. If not - you can retake it, no film wasted. This is a perfect process for me.

Printing speed is very good (I read some complaints about that and don't get it), quality of the photo is very decent. Of cause, it is not a perfect full scale printing. But what could you expect from such a tiny box? It also adds that old-stile, less-technology, analogue vibe. The lack of internal storage - I think it is a plus. Otherwise, it is just a digital camera, but you already have a way more sophisticated one in your phone. And you can connect it and print from the phone.

We did just one cartridge, but I'me sure we will be shooting a lot on this camera.; This printer is not fast, as it does the four pass print. But the photos come out so good. I also have another brand mini photo printer and the quality of the Kodak is so much better. The only problem I have is the battery drains so fast, like after just a few printings. And the on switch takes several attempts to finally turn on, you have to hold your tongue a certain way I think 🤔. I've had an older models of this printer and never had either of these problems with them. Still, I prefer the prints from this printer over the other brand I have by far. And the app you download to use it is super user friendly and allows for editing, frames, collages and more.; Es una cámara muy buena, la calidad de las fotos dependen mas de la calidad del archivo que de la cámara, su lente es baste bajo o de gama baja te va a ser más útil de impresiona que de cámara en si. Pero si sabes de fotografía te resuelves el problema fácil, en resumen vale mucho la pena en verdad. Es increíble; Taşınabilir baskı makinesi olarak kullanıyorum baskı kalitesi çok iyi telefondan çekip bundan baskı alıyorum kendi kamerası da iyi fakat bazı durumlarda yetersiz kalıyor genel olarak 5/5; Lo bueno es poder imprimiras fotos desde la galería del teléfono móvil a travéz del bluetoot lo malo la calidad de las fotos no es tan buena"

One of the standout features of this camera is its super lightweight design, making it incredibly easy to carry around. This is perfect for on-the-go photography and vlogging.

The 4K resolution and 48MP capability provide excellent image quality, and the 16X digital zoom allows for versatile framing options.

The camera captures good 4K videos and has good stabilization. It also smoothes skin, a kind of beauty mode to make you look good in videos.

The autofocus is also really good. Features like Product Showcase and Background Defocus also make it better. If you need a compact camera for vlogging, get it. This camera is not good for photos. It also lacks longer zoom range. In case you want a camera that can also capture good photos, avoid it. Consider it as a video camera only.; I got this camera after seeing rave reviews in YouTube. However, this review will focus on the shortcomings only. I discovered after 10 days of use.
1. Poor battery life : does not last even 3 hours of use. However, this is compensated by the extra battery provided. But the way battery compartment is designed does no good to the purpose. you need to unscrew from mount to change The battery. So you will need to break your schedule in case u are shooting something continuous.
2. Error Error - the dreaded E:62:10 error appeared in my camera after few days of use. Although I did not face any difficulty in shooting. It did make my experience bitter. Could not resolve though the solutions available on internet. The usual switch on of. Change battery etc does not work and the error message is a part of the display now.
3. Mic : even tough the mic is a strong one. It does not do well to reduce background noise.
4. Charging time : 150 mins. This really restricts ur ability to shoot and u need to plan ahead if you are a serious vlogger.
5. Not weather proof. : the manual says it is not weather proof and small amounts of water may damage the internal circuits. I mean why? It restricts your ability to take outdoor shoot and a vlogger would not take this.

Apart from the above. The camera delivers what it promises in the review videos.

Update :
My lens assembly was faulty. Thankfully Sony service centre was open and as directed by the Sony representative, I gave the camera for repair. It took 14 days to get the part from abroad and complete the repairs. Now, the camera is working fine. No issues as such.
Update 2: Please go through the settings and understand each setting before shooting. There are a lot of helpful YouTube videos on this camera.
Update 3 : The camera worked fine for 2 days after repairs. As of now it is still in the repair shop. 2 months after purchase the camera is 28 days.(and counting) in repair shop. Even after 2 trips of repair shop the error does not go away. Now it is a permanent display in my camera.
Update 4: Sony had finally replaced the camera with a new one. Will update if there are issues in the new one. From mid September to mid December the camera was in the repair centre for at least 50 days before it was finally replaced.; Sony Digital Vlog Camera ZV 1 (Compact, Video Eye AF, Flip Screen, in-Built Microphone, Bluetooth Shoot..... its a very good vloging camera. no problem even after use of one year. good battery back up. I have used during my Kedarnath trip 2022. satisfied with the product. Satisfied with Amazon delivery; So i have been using this Beast For Almost 2 Months Now And Tbh Im Loving it Especially The AF Of This Camera is Really Awesome and the quality it gives is just amazing for a point and shoot camera almost directly comparable to DSLRs worth 100k+ inr
there is only 2 very minor issues that i suffered from
1;- battery life it does not long last if you do vlogging i would recommend you getting a extra battery
2;- lense is not interchangeable (the built in lense kit is good infact really awesome but interchangeable lenses gives a creator flexibility); This is a good camera to buy even in 2022-23,
The battery life is not as bad as some reviews suggest. The picture quality is awesome ,the only thing I didn't quite like is Sony colors. Canon has much better colors straight out of camera. Overall it is a great camera.; Like all modern sony cameras, you gotta know to a certain extent what you're doing to get the most out of the cameras. To be fair, this applies to all cameras including smartphone cameras, but that's beside the point.
Anyway, this camera was released about 2 years ago at the time of me writing this. I bought it for someone else, as it fit the budget and it has all the features that they'll need. I did have a day to test it out and the TLDR is that it's a very easy recommendation for anyone who wants a compact camera that can take excellent stills and videos but doesn't need a huge zoom range.

My primary digital camera is a sony a6600, and the zv-1 has a very similar image quality to that. Both in video and photo modes. The a6600 of course has more dynamic range and better low light but that camera also costs a little over twice as much as this one and both serve different demographics.

The zv-1 has an adequately fast (i.e. wide aperture) lens with equivalent focal length of 24-70mm, which is a solid range for most things. The lens is sharp throughout the zoom range and has very little defects (defects as in chromatic aberration, distortion, vignette etc.).

The video quality is excellent. If you know your way around any NLE, I'd recommend shooting in 4k @100mbps always and with a custom picture profile with gamma set to s-log2 and gamut set to itu709. Set detail to the lowest possible value (-7). That, i find, to be the optimal setting for the low bitrate 8bit footage. If you don't want to do post processing, perhaps I'd suggest using no picture profile but turning up DRO to max.

The cons would include a very short battery life. However, the camera can be powered indefinitely with a power bank. I reckon it's an acceptable tradeoff for the tiny footprint of the camera. Speaking of which, you might also wanna get a strap for it as it doesn't come with one and if you have bigger hands like i do, there's definitely a risk of it falling.

I didn't have time to do super thorough tests, but from what I've seen, I think I can easily recommend this camera to anyone who wouldn't mind the limitations of it. The primary limitations being a smaller sensor size, fixed lens and a small battery.

Oh, and it doesn't have a flash built in but I kinda prefer not having a built in flash because i never use it and it's just one more thing waiting to break."

Neat and natural.; 📷 Perfect for Beginners: The point-and-shoot camera is easy to use for new analogue hobbyists.","La regalé a mi pareja y la llevamos a todos los viajes, es muy ligera y fácil de usar, y las fotos salen preciosas! Estoy muy feliz con la compra. Al ser de doble exposición se ahorra mucho en rollos. Me encanta!; I bought this to take with me on a Europe trip. I wasted a couple shots at the beginning of the roll because the counter isn't super clear when it starts, but not a huge deal; you get 72 vertical shots per roll of 35mm film. I used Kodak Color Plus 200 ISO & am happy I went with that ISO. This camera does not do well in low-light--it couldn't capture a brightly lit Eiffel Tower. It does have flash option, but I opted not to use it.

This camera is compact & light enough that I was able to have it in my cross-body bag along with my phone, passport/wallet, & portable battery along with a few other random things. It survived 5 countries and a week of train travel! I prefer shooting with natural light & I think this camera + film selection was great for getting those types of compositions.

I did not opt for prints when I got the roll developed, but it was a little bit more for development & scanning since it's a half-frame camera. I got 72 4x6 shots on one roll. These photos will be portrait by default, the opposite of a regular camera.; I've gone through my fair share of point-and-shoot cameras and this one has been the best by far. While it is made of plastic and therefore feels a bit cheap, it still does the trick and has lasted longer than any of my other plastic cameras.

The best part, however, is that it takes 2 photos per film frame which means you get double the amount of photos. 36 exposures = 72 pictures. film is expensive these days so this is something I can really appreciate.

No complaints over here! Happy customer; Schöne, handliche Retrokamera mit super BIldqualität.
Ich habe die Kamera anstatt einer Sofortbildkamera gewählt, weil sie viel handlicher ist.
Das kleine Format macht es besonders attraktiv.
Super um schöne Momente festzuhalten!

Die Filme sind jedoch recht teuer, muss es einem schon wert sein.; Facil de usar"

Pros
* Comfortable grip
* 61 MP full frame sensor
* Image is crisp AF

Cons
* Battery is less compared to A7 RIII; The price is to high compared to other market and it around 2.6grand in US so SONY be carefull Panasonic S1 is winning market with 180fps and 4k60.; cost ' is very high; Incredible camera. I upgraded from the A7iii and I am amazed by the picture quality and the ability to crop the photos and still retain the resolution. I took it on a recent trip to Key West for a wild dolphins watch. I am so glad I brought the A7riv with me. I was able to take some amazing pics of the dolphins from far away using the Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 and then crop in. The focus tracking works amazingly well as well. Noise is definitely worst then the A7iii in low light situation. But I am willing to live with that with all the other amazing features of the A7Riv.; The A7R4 isn't for everyone, but if your niche meets the needs of high resolution and mirrorless performance, it is fantastic.

Combined with the Sony 90mm Macro I can attain tac sharp focus handheld on insect eyes. I can shoot tiny jumping spiders, assassin bugs, flowers, lichen, moss, and all kinds of incredibly tiny subjects. APSC mode (or crop in Lightroom) makes this both the highest resolution Full Frame as well as a phenomenal Crop Sensor camera. Win win!

Combined with Sony 24-70 F2.8 GM, I can shoot all of my day-to-day non-macro photos. Things like street photography, infant photography, family photos, and more.

If dual memory card slots is critical to you, then this is a feature you need and will love. Most mirrorless cameras (ie Nikon) are a dang joke! So sad! Seriously, if you don't have dual cards in the camera then it is just a toy, not a tool. Professionals can't risk loosing photos.

File size is huge, managing space might be hard, a fast computer will help in processing and managing your files. Google drive doesn't support Sony RAW files, so I also save jpg versions for quick viewing. More space gone... more upload time required.

The app is actually really great for a newer app. Connecting works all the time, but only if you do things in a particular order. They should fix that... I can control my exposure triangle from the app, shoot, and review a low resolution sample. Great for a remote shutter. Doesnt let me touch to focus... would love remote focus with focus magnifier. Would die for the same with a focus stacking mode from the app. I might be a dreamer though, probably won't ever see this.

Ok, and the back screen. Seriously Sony?! Still poor resolution, but the biggest sin is that the screen still doesn't flip around like canon cameras! Holy smokes, catch a clue Sony! Vloggers are a huge deal, stop ignoring them! At least the app can give you a remote live view experience on your cell phone. So that seems to be a workaround for me. But I can see that not working well for people that blog a lot.

Most people could do well with an A7R3 instead. Could you benefit from the savings? Could you use that for more accessories or glass? Would that help you more than the resolution jump? Maybe!

For macro, the super high resolution is really a big help. Know your needs!

Hope this helps you decide on your next camera! I love my Sony A7R4!; I have owned every A7r camera including the original, A7rii, A7riii, and now the A7riv. The A7riv is the first big image quality improvement in years! Is it worth it to upgrade to 60MP? Definitely but be aware that this still a specialized camera and not an action camera.

The camera industry remained stead at the 24MP range for years now. In the past year the Canon R5 and R6 cameras have pushed the envelope and the new megapixel race is back in full swing. Usually high megapixel wars were more about bragging rights and marketing than actual usability. Noise and image quality decreases with higher resolutions due to smaller physical pixels. This remains true with the A7riv's 60MP sensor over the A7riii's 42MP. However the increased resolution minimalizes the perceivable noise increase (You won't see it unless you pixel peep). In addition, the higher resolution helps with sharpness, contrast, and cropping flexibility across the board and you get an overall better camera.

The Good:

Image Quality. As mentioned above 60MP improves sharpness and cropping flexibility. There is some degradation of dynamic range and noisier ISOs. But again, since the resolution is much finer, the small amounts of noise introduced is much less noticeable at these resolutions. When used with uncompressed RAW (see below) you get much better ISO and dynamic range.

Cropping. I cannot emphasize the ability to crop with 60MP. The larger megapixel count gives greater range of flexibility to crop, refocus, and recompose photos in post. Often I change the entire composition of a photo with extreme cropping of my A7riv files. You can change full body portraits into headshots and retain excellent sharpness. Reframe centered subjects to align with rule of thirds or vice versa. The ability recompose shots afterwards is amazing!

Autofocus. The A7riv has a significantly improved AF that covers much more of the sensor than the A7riii. The A7riii just added a few more contrast detection points over the A7rii but the A7riv has PDAF points nearly covering the entire sensor. With my A7riii it was very difficult to eye-AF on subjects on the corners of the sensor. With the A7riv, unless your subject is on the very edge of the sensor, you will have full AF functionality including eye-AF. Furthermore the AF is much snappier and eye-AF finds the eye faster and stays locked on in dimmer conditions and further away than the A7riii.

Battery. The camera still uses the newer Z batteries that comes with the newer generation of Sony cameras. The Z Batteries have doubled life over the older W batteries. Getting such a long runtime with such a high MP camera is pretty great.

IBIS stabilization. Sony was one of the first large companies to use IBIS in full frame cameras. 5.5 stops of stabilization is amazing and still makes handheld slow light photos seem like they were on a tripod. I am still amazed by this feature sometimes. Tests do show that in real world tests the A7riv has slightly better IBIS stabilization than the A7riii.

Ergonomics/usability: Not much has changed over the A7riii. Every year, each new version of the camera is bigger, thicker, and heavier. The joystick feels nicer and the shape is more comfortable. The camera itself is slightly thicker which is better to hold for your hands. There are no glaring issues here.

The bad:

Dynamic Range. Dynamic range is on par with other cameras of this generation. However shadow recovery is slightly worse than the A7riii. This is mainly due to the use of Compressed RAW setting with continuous shooting. When using Compressed Raw and continuous/burst mode, the camera shoots at 12-bit instead of 14 bit. If you shoot in single shots with uncompressed RAW you can get much better dynamic range and shadow recovery. 60Mp files are huge and not easy to process and this camera is NOT an action camera. But the fact that you can get 10fps with a 60mp camera even at 12-bit is still pretty amazing.

Processing speed: With 60MP, writing to SD cards is even slower than before. As previously mentioned you can improve image quality by using uncompressed raw which DOUBLES file sizes from around 59mb to around 117mb. This makes writing to a regular 90/95mb/s USH-I card EVEN SLOWER. You can't review images after each shot without waiting for the writing to clear. With continuous multiple shots it takes EVEN SLOWER! You can help alleviate this problem with faster UHS-II 300mb/s cards but at the time of this review these cards are RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE. Sony really needs to implement compressed lossless RAW files as 60MP is nearing the limit and resolution will continue to creep up.

Speed. This is not an action or sports camera, but it CAN handle some action at 10fps. As mentioned previously, shooting in burst and continuous does reduce quality a bit. If you are a wedding photographer or lifestyle/street photographer this will be fine for your needs. However if you are shooting sports, dance, motion, a dedicated action sports camera that can handle the speed without quality loss like the A1 or A9 would be better suited for you.

Pixel shift. Pixel shift is a great feature on paper. The sensor shifts very slightly letting you get significantly better quality images by using quadrupling the color information in each pixel. However realistically you can't use it without some smearing or ghosting. Unless you are using it for perfectly static scenes you will get some sort of smearing. Wind moving tree leaves or grass, moving cars in cityscapes, any movement will throw off the sensor. I have never meaningfully used this feature. Additionally you need Sony's Edge software to compile the images which just adds to the processing steps.

This is a great camera and a phenomenal upgrade. It does however have some limitations. For years the A7r series was the flagship camera of Sony's line. However we must remember this is really geared for landscapes and studio work were lighting conditions are controlled and you don't need to shoot fast action. Sony has diversified with the A9 and A1 line with the A9 being sports and the A1 being the dedicated all-around flagship camera with little compromises. For your everyday photographer who is not shooting ballet dancers or basketball games regularly, this should be perfectly suitable for their needs. Even professional wedding and street photographers will find little to complain about. Only the most demanding action photographers pushing the limits will want more.; Great all around camera. Only issue is navigating Sony menu on the camera.; Ok so after a few days upgrading from my good old Canon 6d, here are a few cons :

Noise :
- noisier than A7R3 and A73 so not great for taking pictures of my kids inside with only ambient lightning
- A7R4 is about 1/3 stop noisier than A7R3 which means, to have as little noise, you need to let enter 1/3 stop more light
- which means you need to lower your shutter speed (or increase aperture) by 1/3 stop, for example from f/250 to f/160, which means you will have more difficulty freezing action so your image have chances to be blurrier

File size :
- uncompressed raw files are huge (120mb)
- there is no lossless raw compression
- you will a fast computer ($$) and a lot of SSD space to process these files
- you will need large fast SD cards (UHS-II, U3, at least 256GB) that are expensive ($$)
- even Sony SF-M sd card is relatively slow and won't allow me to quickly see my photos to review focus for example, I have to wait for the buffer to clear, else it's laggy, which is quite annoying, I will have to try Sony SF-G
- Canon r5, Sony a7rIII, a7s3 files are much smaller so they are faster to process, think about it since your time is valuable

Complexity :
- not much is simple with this camera
- menus could be worst but they are not user friendly at all
- a ""slow"" SD card makes shooting in continuous mode quite annoying/odd/slow, Sony should warn the user
- no scene selection mode like on my Canon 6D for people that want or need simplicity (I don't trust full auto mode)
- saved settings for memory recalls can't be renamed to meaningful description
- touch tracking not enabled by default
- limited touch screen functionalities (only useful to set tracking point basically)
- enabling Preview makes Continuous Mode atrocious because the Preview also appears in the Viewfinder
- to zoom a Sony lens, it's the inverse direction than on the Canon (might be Canon's fault)
- would be nice if Sony gave recommended settings (some kind of pre-sets/suggestions for Custom Keys/Buttons and My Menu Favorites)
- no automatic focus bracketing
- PlayMemories software keeps creating .modd files and importing my PC pictures in its library even if I unselected all folders from being imported.

I tried the feature ""View on TV"", I get ""could not authenticate the connection"" on the camera and Registration failed on my sony TV (xbr 65x900e). I tried multiple times. Then I tried connecting by entering the password, I got ""could not find the access point"".

Then I tried the new app for ios devices called Visual Story. First, why not on android ? This is not very respectful of android users. Second, it was not available in Canada. Third, (once I changed my country in apple store) the process to set it up is a mess, the ipad does not see the camera when trying to connect via bluetooth to set up the FTP and I tried with multiple ipads.

Update after a few months : I got used to its many flaws and I was able to get good results without too much trouble. But this does not make it a better product. Another missing opportunity : there is no way to see the focus points using Sony Imaging Edge. Let's say you want to check where your focus was to better understand the end result. Finally, for video, the image stabilization is disappointing. My phone and my gopro are miles better and both are less expensive. Now Sony released the A1, double the price of the R4 and they have not updated the firmware on the R4 since over 6 months, pretty disappointing, not sure I will buy another camera from Sony because I don't want to encourage Sony to release more expensive products instead of improving flawed products already released.

Any pros ? Ok cropping when you have images of that size/resolution is pretty insane (as long as you have low iso and no motion blur), dual slot is always good to have, dynamic range is good, battery life is ok and it survived to Canadian winters."

However it came with a Battery charger that costs around 100$.

Packaging was Okay. Could have been better considering the Camera price.

Bought is during Sale for 12% Off on MRP. After sale the discount is 13% Off on MRP. Thats a 1% loss for buying during the sale.; It's a pure hybrid, that does most of the stuff one wants. I just wish it had 4k 60 uncropped, but that's a business choice Sony made. Pretty pricey, but it's a camera you know why are buying.

Really good AF. It does get slightly hot recording in 4k.

My seller was Appario and I received order a good few days before promised delivery date.; The Sony a7 IV is the fourth generation of the company's core a7 full-frame mirrorless camera model. It's the most advanced yet, bringing many of the improvements Sony has made in terms of autofocus and interface design since the launch of the a7 III, back in February 2018.

Key Specifications
33MP BSI CMOS full-frame sensor
Up to 10 fps shooting in lossy Raw with extensive buffer
In-body stabilization rated up to 5.5EV
Full-width oversampled 4K from 7K, up to 30p
4K/60p (from 4.6K capture) in Super35 / APS-C mode
10-bit video or HEIF stills capture
H.265 video, S-Cinetone color mode
3.69M dot OLED viewfinder
Twin card slots (1x CFe A/UHS-II, 1x UHS-II SD)
Full-time Bluetooth LE connection
The a7 IV sees just about every one of its specifications improved over the a7 III, from basics such as the resolution of the sensor and viewfinder to significantly increased video capture options.

The Sony a7 IV is the latest in Sony's a7 full-frame mirrorless camera lineup, boasting advanced improvements in autofocus, interface design, and key specs such as a 33MP BSI CMOS sensor, 10 fps shooting with ample buffer, 5.5EV in-body stabilization, oversampled 4K video, 10-bit capture, H.265 video, S-Cinetone color mode, a high-resolution OLED viewfinder, dual card slots, and full-time Bluetooth LE connectivity. Compared to its predecessor, the a7 III, nearly every aspect of the a7 IV has been upgraded, from sensor resolution to enhanced video capabilities.; ; The camera is super awesome, have been waiting for this model for 2 years.
The camera body is highly recommended though I suggest not to take the kit lens as it is not that sharp, instead by your custom range lens online and the kit lens is not going to be much useful.; Just buy it. If you're not cropping in your images, there's no need for an a7r iv or v.
I am using it with a 50mm 1.4 and soon 35mm 1.2 - It's everything I'll need.; Although price is little bit high but we get extra accessories with this as 64gb v60 sony sdxc card, battery charger. Other than rest all are good.; Great going. Best ever mirrorless Camera for photography. Loving it.
BUT IT GETS HEATED IF U VIDEO SHOOT IN 4K RESOLUTION. THERE IS NO WAY OUT TO STOP THE HEATING PROBLEM IN THIS CAMERA WHEN YOU SHOOT IN 4K.
A VERY SMART BUT A HANDICAPPED CAMERA.
THIS CAMERA IS HIGHLY OVER PRICED.
SO IT IS BETTER TO TAKE TWO CHEAPER CAMERAS ONE FOR PHOTOSHOOT AND ANOTHER FOR 4K VIDEOGRAPHY IN MUCH LOWER BUDGET.
NOT RECOMMENDED DUE TO HEATING ISSUE IN 4K VIDEO SHOOTING."

After going through many reviews and user experiences of both gopro 12 and action 4, I decided to bet my money on this.

And oh boy, I wasn't disappointed at all. Very good build quality, better performance than its competitor, no overheating, no crashes, good battery life. You'll just have to play around with the video settings until you get your preferred quality, and once that is set (I have found mine pretty quickly), you just need to record. That's all.

The accessories provided make life much easier on a trip and 3 batteries can last you from 6am to 6pm (unless, obviously you are recording continuously) with around 6-7 hours of recording time. The battery case makes things even more convenient as you can just plug it to a power bank and toss it in your backpack to get the batteries ready.

Overall, I think this was an excellent purchase at 45K (price dropped to 41K when I was writing review :')) if you are a content creator or just want to capture memories without having to care about a dozen other settings in other cameras. Very happy with the purchase.; I read many positive reviews but somewhere in my mind there is a doubt whether should I buy this product or not. Somehow I convinced to buy this and brought it. Even while opening the product also I was bit hesitate.

But after opening and testing the DJI Osmo4 , my hesitations completely went off from my mind. This is just Awesome action camera. Afte 3 days of testing, I am giving this review. Guys, just go for it. Value for money. Everything is perfect as per my requirement. Really awesome product.; I'm still a newbie to using this camera. But upon a bit experimenting I realized the video is amazing during daylight, but a bit hazy during night or where there is less of light. The major problem that I'm facing is the heating issue. I just used it for 20 mins and it started heating like anything. I'll put my review comment to stop and will back with next edit if I find any other flaws or pros.; ; Really great quality photos..
Non lens cap, bought a silicon case with lens cap.
Works as a webcam also.
Tiny , sturdy, great battery life and really good quality image/videos; Buy it; GoPro 7,9 और 11 इस्तेमाल करने के बाद जब मैं कैमरा अपग्रेड के बारे सोचा तो गोप्रो 12 और dji में से किसी एक को choos करना बड़ा मुश्किल था। क्यों कि पॉपुलैरिटी में गोप्रो बाजी मारता दिखाई दे रहा था और मैं गोप्रो के 3 मॉडल काफी समय इस्तेमाल भी कर चुका था। फिर भी एक रिस्क लिया और फाइनल DJI को खरीद लिया। सच में मैं हैरान था इसकी वीडियो क्वालिटी और परफॉर्मेंस देख कर! सबसे ज्यादा हैरान तो मैं इसके ना के बराबर हीटिंग को लेकर था। जो कि Gopro कैमरे की खास पहचान है। वीडियो क्वालिटी के तो कहने ही क्या! मैने टेस्ट करने के लिए पूरी शादी का वीडियो बना डाला। तीन बैटरी में पूरी शादी कवर हो गया। ना तो कैमरा कहीं गर्म हुआ ना ही hang! अगर कोई वीडियो क्वालिटी देखना चाहे तो मैं clips दे सकता हूं।
D-log m 10 bit to कमाल का फीचर है इस कैमरे में। मैने ज्यादातर D-log का ही इस्तेमाल किया क्योंकि normal calor mod पर over सैचुरेटेड कलर प्रोड्यूस कर रहा था। ये भी अपनी अपनी पसंद की बाद हो सकती है। शादी में आए प्रोफेशनल वीडियो shoot करने वालों ने सैंपल के तौर पर जब DJI के वीडियो को लैपटॉप पर play करके देखा तो अपना माथा पकड़ कर बैठ गए। अपना ढाई किलो का कैमरा साइड में रख कर इसे नमस्कार करने को मजबूर हो गए। मुझे खुशी है कि मैं gooro की भेडचाल से निकलने में कामयाब रहा।
और सबसे खास बात तो ये लगा कि वीडियो देख कर लगता ही नहीं ये video action camera से shoot किया गया है। क्योंकि वीडियो में distortion बिल्कुल भी नहीं है। मैने सभी वीडियो horizon बैलेंसिंग (HB) mode पर shoot किया था।; i loved gopro since its early days. those times also competition was there.

but this time dji goes ahead of gopro & with quite a margin.

i love its magnetic clamp, low light performance, voice quality, the dji ecosystem including the awesome mics, dual screens and not to forget better battery over the gopro.

highly recommended. i am also gonna buy dji osmo pocket 3 creative combo so that i can use the wireless mics with this beauty.

must have for content creators.; As an avid adventurer and content creator, I recently acquired the DJI Osmo Action 4 Adventure Combo, and I must say it has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance, versatility, and convenience. This comprehensive kit offers everything needed to capture stunning action footage and photos during outdoor excursions and adrenaline-packed activities.

The DJI Osmo Action 4 camera itself is a powerhouse of technology, boasting impressive 4K video recording capabilities and advanced stabilization features that produce smooth and steady footage even in the most dynamic environments. The camera's dual screens—a front-facing and rear touchscreen—enable effortless framing and composition for vlogs, selfies, and action shots.

The Adventure Combo includes an array of essential accessories that enhance the Osmo Action 4's capabilities and provide added value for outdoor enthusiasts. The included waterproof case allows for underwater shooting adventures, granting access to depths up to 60 meters and ensuring protection against water damage.

I particularly appreciate the multiple mounts and attachments included in the Adventure Combo, such as the handlebar mount, chest harness, and adhesive mounts, which facilitate hands-free filming and creative shooting angles during various activities like cycling, hiking, and watersports. The included carrying case provides convenient storage and transport for all components and accessories, keeping everything organized and easily accessible on the go.

The Adventure Combo's extended battery life ensures prolonged shooting sessions without interruptions, enabling me to capture all the action and excitement of my adventures without worrying about running out of power. The overall build quality and durability of the Osmo Action 4 and its accessories inspire confidence during rugged outdoor activities, making it a reliable companion for all my adventures.

In conclusion, the DJI Osmo Action 4 Adventure Combo is a comprehensive and high-quality kit designed for adventure enthusiasts who demand top-notch performance, durability, and versatility in their action cameras. This combo offers an exceptional value proposition for capturing and documenting memorable moments in the great outdoors with unparalleled ease and precision.; You can watch many reviews on youtube and see for yourself why this is better than go pro. The list is very extensive. This might also sometimes come down to personal preference however. I have a few DJI drones and I find that the picture quality matches better in post production when using the same brand.

I like it for the simple fact that it is easy to use and has the portrait mode for making videos for social media.

I also like the magnetic mounts that DJI uses, no more fiddling around and dropping screws!

Cons: You cannot pause and resume recording like you can on your phone. This was annoying when I discovered it but hopefully this can be resolved with a future firmware update? Currently when you stop recording , there is no way to continue. When you press record again it starts recording a new video.

Another downside is I find the battery does not last as long as I expected but I have been testing it in 4k so that is probably why.

All in all, great little action cam, glad I waited for the 4 and held out on the 3!; Comienzo comentando que estuve a nada de regresar la cámara, debido a los malos comentarios que tiene en las reseñas y quise permitirme comprobar todo lo que mencionan por mi propia cuenta.

les comento que muchos indican que la cámara se apaga a los 5 minutos de estar funcionando. si y no, la cámara no se apaga, se apagan las pantallas pero no deja de grabar. es una función que incluso se puede modificar en los ajustes de la cámara, es solo una manera de ahorrar batería.

La puse a grabar a sus máximas calidades, para comprobar que no se apagara incluso con los casi 40° de temperatura que hace en mi localidad, y la cámara se calienta lo normal, nada que alarmarse y tampoco por ese motivo dejo de grabar o se apagó.

otra de las cosas es que muchos indican que se congela la toma o se corta la grabación, eso solo ocurre si le colocas una tarjeta micro sd que no sea la correcta, la propia cámara menciona las que son compatibles y le funcionan mejor, yo le coloqué una sandisk Extreme Pro de 64 y me ha ido bastante bien.

Cosas que debo resaltar, La calidad excepcional de la imagen, muy nítida incluso haciendo zoom digital, se distorsiona muy poco, es una cámara muy rápida en cuanto a desplazamiento en sus pantallas, su configuración es sencilla e intuitiva y la propia cámara te va ayudando poco a poco. Es una cámara super elegante, la calidad de sus materiales es impresionante, es discreta, es ligera, y el sistema de anclaje rápido con imanes es mas funcional de lo que parece. La batería es cosa de otro mundo, dura lo suficiente y necesario para sacar muchas buenas capturas.

cosas que la verdad aun puede mejorar, las tomas con poca iluminación, sin embargo es superior que otras cámaras.

les invito a que le den una buena oportunidad a la cámara, de intentar llevarla al extremo obviamente con los requerimientos que la misma cámara solicita y que no se dejen llevar por cualquier comentario.

De mi parte estoy mas que feliz de haber realizado esta compra.; Having had GoPros since they came out, there were some concerns about moving to DJI and the Action 4. I have to say, wish I had done this a few years ago. The device is so good, small, light but also strong and the image quality for pictures and video is so good. I would recommend this for sure. The Apps are also great to and simple to use, but allow editing to the max too if required. Can’t wait for any upgrades now.; Como usuario de un dron DJI no me ha sorprendido la gran calidad del vídeo, lo que es cierto en cualquier resolución (1080, 2,7K o 4K). La óptica aguanta bien el flare. Impresionante que haya un perfil de color de 10 bits, y un ajuste de reducción de ruido y de nitidez que graba en un perfil relativamente plano para editar mejor en post, si es lo buscado. Lo que me ha sorprendido también, pero no positivamente, es el gran tamaño de los archivos. Para que os hagáis una idea: salida de 70 min. grabando en 1080 y 60 fps: 27 GB. Salida de 39 min. grabando a 2,7K y 25 fps: 14 GB. Salida de 46 min. grabando en 4K y 24 fps: 29,5 GB. No hay mayor problema, excepto que en una micro-SD de 128 GB caben pocas excursiones. Si es el precio a pagar por la calidad del vídeo, bienvenido sea. La estabilización del metraje es sencillamente impresionante: no pestañea ni en descensos en bici a 40 km/h por caminos medio-rotos (cámara en el manillar). La autonomía es superior a cualquier cámara de acción que haya tenido anteriormente. El anclaje por imán / pestañas es rápido y fiable.
He podido navegar por los menús y configurarlos sin mirar una sola vez el manual. El sistema operativo es muy intuitivo, y gracias a las dos pantallas táctiles, muy práctico de usar. Suelo empezar la grabación, terminarla, y apagar la cámara por comandos de voz, aunque sólo entiende inglés (start recording, stop recordig, shut down). Comodísimo. No la he probado en fotos.
En resumen, estoy bastante impresionado. Son sólo tres salidas las que he hecho, pero ni un problema, ni una sola incomodidad o limitación.
Se ve un producto ""redondo"", de calidad. No llego a imaginar de qué forma se podría mejorar esta cámara. No la puedo comparar con la Gopro 12 ya que no la he probado, pero estoy seguro de que quien compre esta Osmo 4 no se va a sentir decepcionado. Lo único que he echado en falta es un protector de lente. Por aquí se lo encuentra por unos 8 € (no de la marca)."

If you're in the market for an affordable yet high-quality action camera, I highly recommend giving the IZI Click a try. It's an incredible value for money, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase!; This is a very basic camera, very poor video quality also video flickering issue while recording,neither does it have any much function nor is the video quality so good, it would be better to visit a shop and buy it instead of buying it online. So that you can avoid wasting your money like me, Amazon has a return policy only if it is defective and not a refund.; Bought this on Summer sale for INR 8,499.

Stabilization not upto the mark, but ok. Data transfer is fast. Considering the price, this action camera offers exceptional value for money. Overall, I highly recommend the IZI One PLus; You just need a high processing memory card otherwise 60FPS will not work
Video quality is very nice
Sound quality is okay but it cannot reduce noise
Battery is also good
Value for money; Showing IZI new One+ in product description but have received IZI one normal one which is available at Amazon in rs. 1000/- less price.

The camera is not gud at all. Only good thing about this camera is accessories that we get with it, else everything is pooor. The main thing for which one buys an action camera is stabilization, which is worst in this camera.....dynamic range sucks ......a one minute video in 4k 60 fps takes 1 gb of storage which is too much as compared to the quality it delivers. I mean1 gb space for a video of 1 minute that too in poorest quality is way too much. Highly highly disappointed by this product. 5 hazaar or add karke DJI action 2 lena sahi hai. Iska wide angle ekdum bekaaar ....kora bakwaaas wide angle. Video clarity ghatiyaaa.....self vlogging jisme aap khud ko jada dikhate ho uske liye ye cam thoda theek hai....baaki motovlog, carvlog, action vlog ke liye isse bekaar koi product nahi ho sakta ....do not waste ur money.

The camera works perfectly fine. Prints good quality images and will also record a voice QR for your memorable behind the scene giggles and joys. Do not expect the picture quality of the highest standards, this is meant to keep your moments in a print format as it occurs. Not everyone may like it a lot due to the individual pictures price. But to me capturing pictures and the joy of getting an instant image is far greater. Combo package gives you an option of instantly keeping your photos into. The fridge magnets are another good way to show your memories to the visitors. Though placing the magnet is a bit tricky.
I was looking at the Instax mini 11 before looking into pros and cons of both. Then this seemed like a better option for few extra bucks (with all the offers I got it for 10.4k approx).
*Give a thumbs-up if you like the review.; Easy to use, The print quality (from phone) is really good. Camera picture quality gets slightly out of focus/ undefined but decent when close to subject (the sound recording and frame option is only available in camera picture). One advantage of camera picture is that it doesn't print immediately, you can retake pics and choose the best to print - you can avoid under/over exposure this way (the rest can be stored in SD card). The photo book quality that comes along with this pack isn't great, so i bought another one. Over-all happy with my purchase.; Good packaging . Good quality . Go for it; Best in Instax mini Model.; The camera clarity is not at all good, though it can be used as a printer as it provides convenience of printing, one should rather go for only printer version from Fuji instead of camera; No doubt . .

It is easy to use and the pictures turn out great. My other camera broke. Great buying experience!; El pedido me llego super rapido, antes de la fecha estipulada, perfecto. la camara es de excelente calidad, facil de utilizar. lo que no me gusto es que el instructivo es muy pobre y no explica claramente. La forma de pasar por wi-fi las fotos de la camara al ordenador es un verdadero calvario, tarde como una semana pegado investigando y picandole a la camara para poder lograrlo. por fin lo logre, pero aun encuentro complicado ese proceso. Las fotos la transfiere rapido, pero los videos se tarda muchisimo en hacerlo.; From a day one aspect, it does what it is supposed to do. This is my 3rd Canon ELPH, previous models being the 110 HS and 330 HS.
No discernable difference in picture quality when compared to my 330.
Zoom has greatly improved, and has a bit better image stabilization vs the 330. MP4 has replaced the aged MOV format for videos.

I am NOT a camera techie, and don't use half the features on this camera, but know a good picture when I see one, and one of the main things that impress me with the ELPH line is how great pictures and videos look when displayed on a large screen TV. That's the test for me... I've purchased other models that failed, and were returned.
It's true that today, many cellphones take WONDERFULL pictures and vids, but you are NOT going find the kind of zoom that point and shoots have. When on vacation, I'd have to say 50% of my pictures involve the use of the zoom lens. Actual cameras are still relevant in today's cellphone centric world (at least for the time being).

The REAL reason I upgraded this go around (my 330 is in excellent working condition) was that Canon FINALLY made MP4 the format for the 360's videos. Although previous versions took wonderful HD videos, you have no idea how frustrating it is to transfer a video to your phone, and having to convert it from MOV format first! Converting formats always involves a loss of quality, and I never understood why an Apple format had to be standard on a non-Apple device. MOV is an age old format and MP4 beats it hands down, and is playable on almost any PC or Android device.

Nit-picking... this model has a flimsier battery/card door, and using the Wi-Fi feature I had to use ""manual"" steps to do so, as the ""auto"" feature would recognize the device, but not connect.... not a big thing, but would be nice if it would connect to devices as easily as cellphones do these days.

Over all, I'm quite happy with the camera, and feel the ELPH series offer the best pictures and smallest size in the compact point and shoot category. If it didn't....I wouldn't be on my third model of the line. My first ELPH (110HS) is still working wonderfully 5 yrs later, the only reason I upgrade is for the improved features . I can't recommend this camera highly enough...it's GREAT.

A piece of good advice is when buying a case...look for a hard/semi hard ""clamshell"" type case. My ELPHs look and act pristine after years of use, because they are well protected when being carried or not in use. Pouch style cases won't protect your camera from bumps or accidental drops, which I have encountered many times, and have had no ill effects due to the clam shell cases superior protection.

Update 4-24-16
Just got back from a Vegas trip, where this camera was use extensively. I had nose bleed seats at the T-Mobile Arena Guns n Roses concert. My 1080p cellphone camera could not capture stage action, as the low light filter does not work in zoom mode (all it could capture at full zoom was a blurry mess). Was able to get video with my HS 360 in zoom mode clear enough to actually capture facial expressions....GREAT video, from some of the worst seats in a 40,000 seat arena. How can you beat that from an ultra compact point and shoot? When filming in full HD, I was getting about 45 mins a battery (I took 2 extra). Low light ability is A LOT better than my Note 4's camera. In DAYLIGHT....my cellphone takes excellent pictures and video....at NIGHT....not so much. Glad I had this camera with me.
If you are taking pictures, expect to get 300+ to a battery charge....video, around 45-60 mins. Extra batteries are cheap and quite fast to change out when filming extensively....well worth the money.; Bought this camera for my daughter as a Graduation gift. She loves it! Pictures are beautiful & great quality. She loves that she can take pictures & access them on her phone, through an app, right away. Shipping was also fast, order arrived a day or two earlier than we expected.; I bought this little camera to use on our vacation, my wife finds our Nikon DSLR too complicated and cumbersome to travel with. We wanted a reasonably good point and shoot for the trip. This little camera was fantastic! It is loaded with features you usually only see in a DSLR or bridge type camera and is 1/3 the price at least. I am actually going to set all 4 of my cameras up side by side to take a picture and compare them side by side just because i would almost be w that this little canon elph would at least perform as well if not better than my other dslr and bridge cameras. It’s a very capable little camera with enough manual control to keep me enjoying it and the point and shoot capability to make it fun for my wife to enjoy. I would highly recommend it for travelling light and still having a great camera at the ready."

Straight forward and easy to use. Two batteries give one required for use, equipped with a 32g micro sd. Pictures are clear on the display but they're more cool toned.; ; ; Funny but not so funny story I had been charging and charging this camera in hopes that it would work, never realizing that it required a battery in which it came with, but somehow when I opened it, I was overly excited and misplaced the battery. Now that I have the battery, it is easy to use. The quality of the images are unfortunately not as clear as I would like for them to be however, I’m not too familiar with cameras and where it should be for such a small Camera, I’m still happy with it and plan to use it and upload photos to my computer and play around with it. For $60 as a starter camera, I don’t think it’s too bad. Will update review once I’ve been able to take more photos and use more of the features. It does zoom in pretty well and captures an images with movement .; I received this camera just in time for a few trips I was attending. I set everything up before I left just to ensure I didn’t have any issues. The camera was very easy to setup and use. I have a digital camera that I purchased back in 2008 and this camera was very similar in size and setup. The only difference between the two is that the older camera has to remove the batteries in order to charge each individually. This camera can be charged as is with the battery still inside. There is an opening on the side of the camera where the cord goes and the other end goes into the wall. It came with 2 batteries but in order to charge them both you had to remove the battery from one and insert the other one. This ultimately meant that the settings were not saved as far as date and time and would have to be reset each time. I was gone all day on excursions so I didn’t want to take the chance of not charging both batteries. This was a con for me but no different than what I was used to so not as much of a big deal.

I did not find the quality of the pictures to be as sharp an image as it should have been. It gave the same quality I felt as my older digital camera. The quality is still very good but like I said there’s not that much of a difference between that and my older camera.

A MAJOR con for me is that my pics kept getting cut off. Not blurry. I was not moving. I would be standing right in front of the object and for some reason half the photo would be cut off. There’s nothing blocking the lens. I even cleaned the lens with the soft cloth that had come with it. It still only gives half the pic or just the top of it. It never got wet and I kept it in a hard case that I purchased specifically for the camera. I kept it in my day bag that had nothing else in it except my cash and a couple keychains I bought. None of that matters though because it was still kept protected in a hard case. It didn’t do this for every photo. I definitely took a hundred or so photos with the camera but I have at least 10-12 that were cut off.

I also felt like it took too long to actually take the pic. You have to hold the shutter for a second or two which meant standing very still pushing the button, waiting for the flash, then watching the screen go from live to all black to the still of what you’re taking. It was cumbersome and waaay slower than my original digital camera. I just want to be able to point and shoot. I ended up taking most of my pics on my phone or resorting back to my old camera.

I’m quite a bit disappointed with this camera. It’s ok for the price but you definitely get what you pay for."

Comes with an Indian Fujifilm warranty card to register the product online.
In box items include only a lanyard and micro-USB charging cable. PS - no memory card included (even though the description says a 256gb card is included)
It stores up to 47 pics in the cameras memory without a memory card inserted.
Theres no cover for the front shutter - it's always open.
It's almost the size of an Instax Mini 90 Neo - but a bit smaller in width.
It uses the same film as other Instax Mini cameras, so that's a big plus. You can preview the pic and edit it with various basic filters before printing it. The filters are printed only on the films printable area and not on the borders. However, as of now, you can not edit a pic if you're printing from a phone wirelessly.
(Edit Aug2020 - you can now edit the picture when printing it wirelessly via a mobile. The app got updated so thats good)
I would definitely recommend going for this one since it has an option to save pictures onto a memory card and print later or connect to your phone and print any picture you want from that. Removes the chance of printing a dark or over exposed pic since you can first view the shot and then print, or print a pic you took earlier.
All in all a great camera+printer. But dont expect exceptional photo details/quality.; Looks cool, decent battery life and easy to carry around. Won’t fit in your pocket but is still travel convenient. Photo quality is what you would expect from a film camera. Cartridge can hold 20 film sheets at a time which is standard; Good product; I gifted this to my wife and she absolutely loved it!!! The photo printing capability from smartphone is just amazing. The quality of the photos are really very good. The camera is not upto the mark when compared with today's smartphone cameras but they are decent at this price point.

There are other features in this device (like remote shooting, audio in photo) which I haven't tried yet but they seem really cool as well. Overall, an excellent device at 10.5K!; I am in love with this camera. The picture quality clicked directly with this camera is really nice for its megapixel and the direct printing option is amazing. I wish there the app would allow more edits on direct printing but overall this has fulfilled everything i wanted😊; Quality of picture is really good. We tried both clicking directly from cam and printing from mobile phone . It worked for my 16 year old daughter as well in one go.; Amazing printer and versatile camera. I was actually wanting to buy a printer for instant print but got two in one. Camera quality decent, print quality good. Best part it can take print out of pics taken on mobile too.; easy to use.
picture quality is good
the size of photo is like visiting cards.
if you likes square size of your photos then u go for sq 10.; Lo mejor de esta cámara es que puedes ver las fotos antes de imprimirlas, incluso puedes usarla de impresora de fotos que tengas en tu celular, es la combinación perfecta entre cámara digital e impresora de fotos al estilo polaroid, funciona con los mismos cartuchos de la instax mini, incluso incluye una app para poder imprimir las fotos desde tu celular o transferirte las fotos impresas al teléfono, además se puede colocar una tarjeta SD y pasarte las fotos a la computadora, la calidad de las fotos es buena, no como una cámara profesional pero si mejor que la instax mini, además que tiene flash y la opción de grabar audios en las fotos, las cuales se imprimirán con un QR para poder escanearlas y oírlas, realmente vale la pena y no gastas hojas del cartucho porque puedes revisar las fotos antes de imprimirlas.; Es sencilla y práctica de usar, además puede guardar varias fotografías en la memoria interna o una Micro SD (no incluida) y permite imprimir de tú teléfono, haciendo que si no te termina de convencer del todo la calidad de la cámara, podrás imprimir de un equipo propio que tenga mejor lente, por último, puedes hacer ediciones bonitas con los marcos incluidos o si tienes tiempo y dedicación, hacerte unos propios.; I reviewed a number of instant cameras before settling on this one. It is easy to use one handed and has fun features like frames, moustaches, horns if you want them. I like the quality of the prints having previously used a zink paper printer. Bought through Warehouse, so the discount was the final push.; Mir gefällt die Kamera super auch das man es wenn es gut aussieht sofort ausdrucken kann. Meinen Kindern gefällt es auch Fotos zu machen.; Nice value for money instax camera! Gives the best pictures when you having good lighting.
Also really nice is that it has a bluetooth function which you can send pictures to print them via the camera!
Only downside is that it sometimes cannot take the filmrol (a new one). It keeps saying that you need to apply a new film rol in it."

Quality - Meh
Performance - Almost adequate
Image Quality - Don’t let the pictures on the listing fool you. You’ll get better pics from your cellphone.
Portability - It is definitely portable. Not sure why you would want to take it anywhere with you, but it is very portable.
Ease of Use - The auto settings are pretty useless so you need to know a bit about photography and how cameras work to get anything resembling a passable photo. I’m being generous with that statement.

My advice - Spend a little more money and get yourself a better camera."

Perfect size and is easy to use.; Great little camera. It won't win any photo contests but it takes good, clear photos with decent light. Bit uneven / can get blurry in low light conditions without flash, but no worse than any other pocket camera or even the best smartphone cameras out there in my experience. In dark settings with flash, it does good enough, no complaints. True optical zoom in a camera this price is a huge bonus. The LCD/display isn't too choppy or slow, but you won't mistake it for a high dollar camera. It's got a fast enough refresh rate/quality to do the job without being frustrating.

My only qualm is it either eats batteries quickly or doesn't read battery level correctly with rechargeable Ni-MH batteries. With a fully charged battery, after a couple dozen photos (some with flash, some not), the batteries read low. I continued to use it without the camera dying, so I assume it's conservative in it's battery level readout, or it's optimized for 1.5V alkaline batteries.

Dispone di diversi accessori come un coordino per poterla tenere al polso e di un cavetto per rendere ancora più semplice scaricare foto e video direttamente su un PC.
Utilizza due batterie AA da 1,5V ed è necessario acquistare un scheda SD da utilizzare come memoria (non in dotazione alla fotocamera).
Ci sono inoltre molte modalità di utilizzo e le foto / video vengono molto bene anche con scarsa illuminazione.
Per il prezzo che ho pagato mi aspettavo qualcosa di peggiore invece è andata decisamente oltre le mie aspettative.

Very fine quality; The product was delivered in good condition; Nice product. All good. Working is also good.; We purchased feiyutech scrop -c .Very simple to set camera balance. easy to get allignment. Allignment red marker dot in gimbal is very nice when we need to remove camera from gimbal and fix again on gimbal.
Very nice gimbal for beginners also.Battery life is good. Body material is rigid and motors are very precise.
Easiness for use is the main thing we liked.
Only one minus point we feel that the gimbal come with out charger, bag and also cable to connect for our 5d mark4; I was looking for a gimbal under 25k segment and finally bought Scorp-c , was hesitant at first but it is really great.
And balancing wasn't that hard , once you got used , it is even more easier.
Downside is, it doesn't come with a carry case and not able to find one.

Worth it .; Super nice product; Great gimbel very sharp and stable video shot I'm shoot the wadding video my experience is very good; ; This is the first gimbal I own and it works very well. It took me a couple days to figure out how to work it but after reading the manuals and a lot of YouTube videos, I got it down. I took the SCORP-C out to document some soldiers completing various obstacle courses and let me tell you, this thing can get dirty and keep going. I put this gimbal through dirt, mud, rain, and it never stopped stabilizing. Even after recording all day, it still had half a charge left. I only wish it could handle more weight. Currently I have a Canon R6 MII with an EF 50mm 1.4 f/s setup on the SCORP-C. It can handle an EF 24-105 but barely; Produto chegou rápido, a embalagem um pouco amassada. Porem o scorp-c foi otima compra.
Recomendo.; It's like my camera is to heavy or something. It just can't lift it up! So annoying. I set the balance / motors and all that. It just can't seem to be strong enough to raise my A73 sony; For beginners that are getting their first gimbal this thing is pretty advanced. It is a bit tricky to learn. Balancing your camera on it correctly took me a few tries even with watching a few youtube video. You just have to be logical rather than following direction on youtube because those sometimes are skipping important steps. Once you have it stabilized correctly, make sure you run through the app leveling it and motor adjustments so it corrects itself. The app on the phone is really cool and easy to use. Getting used to all the features and buttons on the gimbal take a bit of practice so just be patient. Start with one lens, best is prime and just have fun with it. Battery holds well so it gives you plenty of time to practice or film. This thing over all gave me a lot more options that I imagined. It is a very cool tool to have considering it isn't all that expensive.; Excelente producto en buen tiempo y muy bueno"

My seller was Appario and I received order a good few days before promised delivery date.; The Sony a7 IV is the fourth generation of the company's core a7 full-frame mirrorless camera model. It's the most advanced yet, bringing many of the improvements Sony has made in terms of autofocus and interface design since the launch of the a7 III, back in February 2018.

Key Specifications
33MP BSI CMOS full-frame sensor
Up to 10 fps shooting in lossy Raw with extensive buffer
In-body stabilization rated up to 5.5EV
Full-width oversampled 4K from 7K, up to 30p
4K/60p (from 4.6K capture) in Super35 / APS-C mode
10-bit video or HEIF stills capture
H.265 video, S-Cinetone color mode
3.69M dot OLED viewfinder
Twin card slots (1x CFe A/UHS-II, 1x UHS-II SD)
Full-time Bluetooth LE connection
The a7 IV sees just about every one of its specifications improved over the a7 III, from basics such as the resolution of the sensor and viewfinder to significantly increased video capture options.

The Sony a7 IV is the latest in Sony's a7 full-frame mirrorless camera lineup, boasting advanced improvements in autofocus, interface design, and key specs such as a 33MP BSI CMOS sensor, 10 fps shooting with ample buffer, 5.5EV in-body stabilization, oversampled 4K video, 10-bit capture, H.265 video, S-Cinetone color mode, a high-resolution OLED viewfinder, dual card slots, and full-time Bluetooth LE connectivity. Compared to its predecessor, the a7 III, nearly every aspect of the a7 IV has been upgraded, from sensor resolution to enhanced video capabilities.; ; The camera is super awesome, have been waiting for this model for 2 years.
The camera body is highly recommended though I suggest not to take the kit lens as it is not that sharp, instead by your custom range lens online and the kit lens is not going to be much useful.; Just buy it. If you're not cropping in your images, there's no need for an a7r iv or v.
I am using it with a 50mm 1.4 and soon 35mm 1.2 - It's everything I'll need.; Although price is little bit high but we get extra accessories with this as 64gb v60 sony sdxc card, battery charger. Other than rest all are good.; Great going. Best ever mirrorless Camera for photography. Loving it.
BUT IT GETS HEATED IF U VIDEO SHOOT IN 4K RESOLUTION. THERE IS NO WAY OUT TO STOP THE HEATING PROBLEM IN THIS CAMERA WHEN YOU SHOOT IN 4K.
A VERY SMART BUT A HANDICAPPED CAMERA.
THIS CAMERA IS HIGHLY OVER PRICED.

This camera seems to be tailored for those just starting in the field, offering a budget-friendly option that helps build a foundation of camera knowledge.

One aspect that stands out is its user-friendly design. Navigating through the settings and controls is relatively straightforward, making it an excellent choice for beginners who might be overwhelmed by more advanced options. The camera's compact size also adds to its convenience, making it easy to carry around and capture moments on the go.

However, I must admit that the image and video quality did not meet my initial expectations. While the camera performs reasonably well, especially considering its affordable price point, there is a noticeable difference in quality compared to more high-end models. This is particularly evident when shooting in low-light conditions, where the images tended to lack the crispness and clarity I was hoping for.

Upon seeking advice from other users, one common suggestion was to invest in an external light to mount on the camera. Taking this advice into consideration, I found that using additional lighting significantly improved the overall quality of both my photos and videos. It seems that the camera's performance benefits from external accessories, and this is something potential buyers may want to keep in mind.

I noticed a marked improvement in the camera's performance when shooting outdoors. The natural lighting conditions contributed to better image and video quality, showcasing the camera's potential when used in optimal environments. This suggests that the camera is well-suited for outdoor photography and videography, making it a suitable choice for capturing moments in well-lit settings.

In conclusion,VETEK Digital Cameras is a commendable entry-level camera for individuals venturing into the realms of photography and videography. While it may not deliver the highest quality results in all situations, it serves as an excellent starting point for beginners to hone their skills. Investing in additional accessories, such as external lighting, can enhance the overall performance of the camera and make it a more versatile tool for creative expression. If you're on a budget and looking to build a solid foundation in camera knowledge, this camera is a worthy contender.; NA; ; ; So I bought this because I wanted to record myself doing hair, but the quality of the video is definitely not good. It is a cute camera though ❤️Nice and sturdy, easy to work, but the video quality wasn’t giving what was supposed to be gave. You are better off just using an iPhone to record."

Produces good colors; Print quality is very good with photos taken from mobile..but camer inbuilt camera is not that good; Rather than looking at it as a camera printer, consider it a printer camera. Because you may not be using the camera as often due to inherent limitations of instant cameras.; The product stopped working in 2 months; I was confused between Kodak and Fujifilm but ended up taking this and am very satisfied. My reasons for purchase were:
1. Brand image
2. Amazing process of printing
3. Best option in this price range
4. Lower cost of film roll compared to Fujifilm; I bought it for my anniversary picture and I am very happy with the product.The ease of access and the print quality is good.Only thing which can be improved is Kodak can give a larger screen and it becomes difficult to guess the exact background.
Pros-Photo filter for variation in photography,Can be paired with mobile and act as a printer,laminated insta pictures for better longer life
Cons-LCD screen size and quality can be improved,Little bit heavy
My verdict-One of the best insta camera.; Picture quality is not that great. Better with mobile photos. Easy & fun to use.; I actually buy this camera due to good review about picture quality but in actual print quality of photo very bad not as expected. Genuinely I feel like it's a waste of money...; Ótimo produto; During the year of use, I took 40 photos, some of them were spoiled by the camera, but in general, it is a very wonderful thing that will bring you a lot of good emotions.; Me agrada que no solo cumple con tomar fotos sino como una impresora de ellas, y de muy buena calidad.
La autonomía de la batería queda un poco corta pero sigue siendo un gran producto, solo tengan cuidado cuando inserten los cartuchos ya que se puede arruinar el mismo.; I rarely write reviews, but upon purchasing and using this product and seeing the onslaught of negative reviews, I had to sit down and type one out.

First, I do not understand the negative reviews. Maybe some critical thinking skills aren't being applied when others have bought this product. You see lots of ""My iPhone/Android camera takes better quality pictures!"" in the complaints. Let's dissect this. Most smartphones nowadays retail for nearly $1,000 in total, and a key element in their advertising is not only the quality of the built in cameras but the constant improves from model to model. Of course, a smart phone camera is going to produce better quality pictures. It's one of the reasons we spend our hard earned money on them. If all we needed was a device to call and text, we'd still be using flip phones. Let's put our thinking caps on and remember why the little computers in our pockets can take excellent if not astounding quality pictures - because they're built to!

Now, this Kodak camera does state it prints ""superior photo"" quality, but it does not boast ""state of the art"" quality or even ""smart phone"" quality, because it knows its place and that would be a flat out lie. Read the fine print, people! Superior does not automatically equate to breathtaking, especially when you look at the product itself. Once again, this is a basic camera/tool. It is not built to be an equal to a smartphone which is essentially, as I said, a mini-computer; It is not built to be an equal to even the lowest tier of professional photography cameras. It IS however, built to be a simple, basic photo taking device that you can also connect to your phone, iPad or other supported device if you choose to.

It does what it says on the box, so I am happy with this purchase. I suspect other customers were expecting something far more complex and souped up, and that is not what this camera is.

Now, the only cons I have for it is that printing process is a little slow, but it takes less than a minute. The paper quality is good though, so I'll let this slide. You can't have everything, especially if you're buying something that is quite budget when it comes to bells and whistles. And that's another thing I'd like to mention - this prints on modern day photo paper. Do not expect the thick, flimsy paper that actual polaroid cameras printed on. If that's what you're after, then you'll be better off heading over to eBay or a pawn shop.

This is a modern take on an old school favorite. Understand what you're buying, and you will be a satisfied customer.; La calidad de las fotos es muy buena y el tamaño es suficientemente grande, a diferencia de otras cámaras instantaneas que te imprimen como mucho tamaño similar al de una foto de carnet. Las funciones que tiene son bastante básicas, pero si lo que buscas es la simplicidad y facilidad de uso de las cámaras instantaneas retro no te hara falta más. Las impresiones son económicas y de buena calidad. Alternativamente con la App de Kodak en el móvil puedes imprimir fotos de la cámara del móvil con todos los filtros y retoques necesarios como si fuese una impresora bluetooth. Ante un apuro también sirve para imprimir un par de fotos de carnet por impresión, eso sí, tendrás que ver que salgan a la escala correcta para que coincidan con el tamaño carnet. No tiene memoria, únicamente puedes imprimir o descartar la foto, para eso mejor usar el móvil y usarla como impresora. A los niños les encanta por ser sencilla de usar y poder ver la foto impresa físicamente. Resulta recomendable comprarle una funda para llevar la cámara y algún recambio de fotos."

Very fine quality; The product was delivered in good condition; Nice product. All good. Working is also good.; We purchased feiyutech scrop -c .Very simple to set camera balance. easy to get allignment. Allignment red marker dot in gimbal is very nice when we need to remove camera from gimbal and fix again on gimbal.
Very nice gimbal for beginners also.Battery life is good. Body material is rigid and motors are very precise.
Easiness for use is the main thing we liked.
Only one minus point we feel that the gimbal come with out charger, bag and also cable to connect for our 5d mark4; I was looking for a gimbal under 25k segment and finally bought Scorp-c , was hesitant at first but it is really great.
And balancing wasn't that hard , once you got used , it is even more easier.
Downside is, it doesn't come with a carry case and not able to find one.

Worth it .; Super nice product; Great gimbel very sharp and stable video shot I'm shoot the wadding video my experience is very good; ; This is the first gimbal I own and it works very well. It took me a couple days to figure out how to work it but after reading the manuals and a lot of YouTube videos, I got it down. I took the SCORP-C out to document some soldiers completing various obstacle courses and let me tell you, this thing can get dirty and keep going. I put this gimbal through dirt, mud, rain, and it never stopped stabilizing. Even after recording all day, it still had half a charge left. I only wish it could handle more weight. Currently I have a Canon R6 MII with an EF 50mm 1.4 f/s setup on the SCORP-C. It can handle an EF 24-105 but barely; Produto chegou rápido, a embalagem um pouco amassada. Porem o scorp-c foi otima compra.
Recomendo.; It's like my camera is to heavy or something. It just can't lift it up! So annoying. I set the balance / motors and all that. It just can't seem to be strong enough to raise my A73 sony; For beginners that are getting their first gimbal this thing is pretty advanced. It is a bit tricky to learn. Balancing your camera on it correctly took me a few tries even with watching a few youtube video. You just have to be logical rather than following direction on youtube because those sometimes are skipping important steps. Once you have it stabilized correctly, make sure you run through the app leveling it and motor adjustments so it corrects itself. The app on the phone is really cool and easy to use. Getting used to all the features and buttons on the gimbal take a bit of practice so just be patient. Start with one lens, best is prime and just have fun with it. Battery holds well so it gives you plenty of time to practice or film. This thing over all gave me a lot more options that I imagined. It is a very cool tool to have considering it isn't all that expensive.; Excelente producto en buen tiempo y muy bueno"

Its compact design makes it easy to hold and carry around, the camera offers decent picture quality for its price range, making it a fun introduction to photography without the risk of damaging more expensive equipment.

One of the standout features is its simple interface, which is intuitive enough for children to navigate without adult assistance. The camera also comes in a variety of bright, playful colors that appeal to kids

However, it's important to manage expectations regarding its performance. The picture quality is basic with zoom feature. Battery life is adequate but could be better, especially during extended use.

Overall, Camera excels in its primary role: providing a fun, inexpensive and lightweight tool for children to explore photography.; I got this digital camera as a gift for my sister-in-law and she really likes it! I wanted a camera that was easy to use and would take great pictures, and this one does the job.

The camera takes super clear pictures and videos, and the zoom feature is really helpful. It's also small and easy to carry around, making it perfect for everyday use.

I was happy to see that it came with a big memory card, so she can take lots of photos and videos without running out of space. The camera is also really easy to use, even if you're not tech-savvy.

My sister-in-law has been taking lots of pictures and having a blast with it. I'm glad I got it for her and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good digital camera.; This is a nice camera for occasional use. I do not think it is sturdy enough to stand up to the rigors of kids, or teens, and especially not as a main camera. I do think it is a good value, and comes with everything needed to get started. I don't know how good the pics are because I sent it back. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this as a primary camera.; Designed with teens in mind, the FHD 4K 44MP Digital Camera in vibrant purple offers a perfect blend of style and functionality. Paired with a generous 64GB SD card and featuring a 16X digital zoom, this compact point-and-shoot camera is ideal for young photographers eager to explore their creativity.

The sleek and compact design of the camera makes it easy for teens to carry it wherever they go, whether it's to a friend's birthday party or a weekend adventure. Its user-friendly interface ensures that even beginners can start capturing high-quality photos and videos in no time.; Don’t waist your money on it. Within less than two hours it was already having problems with the battery compartment. The whole thing looks and feels cheaply made."

About the camera ~
Camera is gorgeous, it's as good as it looks. It's my first camera & the difference in camera vs phone is mind blowing! Camera is Op... The only drawback is, phone has a better wide-angle as compared to camera.
Other than that, the image quality is incredible, you'll know when you try it, the colors straight out of the camera are good. Tbh, the image quality as compared to phone is so good, i think it's a bit of overkill for me. But I'm enjoying it.; Excellent camera - light weight, great looks and easy-to-use.
But the combo is fantastic. Everything you need at a great price. 👍; Was eagerly looking forward to owning this. My order came with extras which was like cherry on the top.; My first mirror less camera. It’s fantastic. Will need a few gears to avoid slipping; I bought it from Appario. Received the box which was open, seal was tampered, SD card was missing, L share grip was missing and the sensor had fingerprint marks on it !!!

Never expected this from Amazon. I placed a return request and Amazon return pickup kept getting rescheduled for 15days because their pickup executive was probably the same guy who delivered this package and he was angry that during delivery I was not ready to accept the package as it was damaged. So, he was not coming to pick it up and was marking it as ""Customer denied return"". After several escalations also I did not get any resolution and finally I had to leave the place of delivery and Amazon was not ready to pick it up from my new place as it is a different city. Even lodging a complaint at Consumer Grienvances portal of Govt of India didn't help. Since the camera was operational, I got the sensor cleaned and kept it. I however lost 25000rs in this as L share grip and SD card was missing. On top of this I got a used camera.

Coming to the camera - it is a good camera if you want a vintage looking camera. But otherwise Z50 is better in terms of grip and general usability.

Picture quality is excellent and Autofocus is fast.

Battery backup is decent.

Overall I would not recommend to buy such expensive items online. Also, offline prices are nearly the same or even cheaper.; ; Atende ao anunciado; Compré esta como mi primera cámara, apenas estoy aprendiendo un poco de fotografía, pero en resumen creo que fue muy buena opción aunque hay modelos más económicos.

Para uso en manual o semi automático es muy práctico que sólo con los diales puedas configurar rápidamente los valores de exposición y velocidad de la foto, pudiendo incluso rescindir de la pantalla y tomar las fotos sólo con el visor.

La cámara en cuanto a cuerpo se siente muy bien construida, solamente de la parte inferior se siente de una calidad o acabado que definitivamente pudo ser mejor, el agarre de la cámara no es el mejor pero venden una empuñadura marca Smallrig que hace bastante diferencia al momento de sostenerla, eso o utilizarla con un tripié.

La cámara la compré con fines de uso casuales y para viaje, no es la cámara más compacta, pero no es difícil llevarla guardada discretamente con su lente desmontado en alguna mochila pequeña.

Hablaré de por qué elegí esta cámara, tenía entre opciones la Sony a6400, la Olympus Om10 y la Lumix G100.

De Sony me llamaba la atención por la marca (en cuanto a calidad) comentaban que tenía muy buen auto focus, resistencia a salpicaduras, buena calidad de foto y más discreta (creo que incluso más compacta) pero no me gustó que la pantalla no fuera 100% táctil, ni completamente articulada (por facilidad de uso y protección, temía que a largo plazo al llevarla en el cuello al chocar con los botones de mis camisas se rayara) carga vía micro Usb (no quiero tener que cargar un 3er cable aparte del Usb C y el Lightning) y no es tan bonita como la Nikon.

De Olympus que tenía el look similar a la Nikon pero a menor precio, y también un poco más discreta al no ser una marca taan comercial en México que llamara atención indeseada, no me gusto por la pantalla tampoco articulada, construcción sólo en plástico, carga via micro Usb y menor rendimiento en condiciones de poca luz o de alto rango dinámico (por ser M 4/3)

De la Lumix por el precio (casi la mitad), pantalla articulada como la Nikon, según reseñas buena calidad de construcción y más compacta, no me gustó por los mismos motivos que la Olympus salvo lo de la pantalla, además de ser más enfocada a videoblogging.

Al final compré esta Nikon Z Fc (sí, por capricho) porque para INICIAR era mejor comprar la Lumix y gastar mucho menos, pero me gustó mucho el look de la cámara y que ahora que la tengo, su forma de utilizarla con los diales que con las otras no hubiera podido, carga vía Usb C, Nikon como marca también tiene fama de tener muy buena calidad, y el tema de las lentes, es verdad que hay pocas para esta cámara de la propia marca Nikon, pero hay bastantes opciones e incluso mucho más económicas por parte de fabricantes terceros como Ttartisan, Viltrox, etc.; gran funcionalidad y opciones. El diseño es muy bueno si estás acostumbrado a cámaras antiguas. Los diales superiores se vuelven algo más natural a estar cambiando modos y combinaciones de botones. Y como extra tiene muchas funciones que esperaba en este tipo de cámaras.
La calidad de imagen en ISOs bajos y altos es bastante buena. quizás ergonomicamente no sea lo mejor. Pero es la única ""queja"" que le puedo poner.

El diseño me encanta y quisas pasa más por una cámara vieja y que podría no llamar tanto la atención. Aunque si note que llama la atención.

Hay muchas funciones por descubrir aunque hay que ir a los menús... los cuales también son configurables al igual que los botones.

Muy satisfecho con la compra. Aunque si el precio es un poco elevado.

Vale la pena.; A Leica user for many years.
This is a beautiful camera.
I ordered a black body and I was sent the wrong one. Disappointing. This is a little flashy, but classic.
Could do without the video. Then maybe include a complete instruction book instead.
That’s my only gripe.

Perfect size and is easy to use.; Great little camera. It won't win any photo contests but it takes good, clear photos with decent light. Bit uneven / can get blurry in low light conditions without flash, but no worse than any other pocket camera or even the best smartphone cameras out there in my experience. In dark settings with flash, it does good enough, no complaints. True optical zoom in a camera this price is a huge bonus. The LCD/display isn't too choppy or slow, but you won't mistake it for a high dollar camera. It's got a fast enough refresh rate/quality to do the job without being frustrating.

My only qualm is it either eats batteries quickly or doesn't read battery level correctly with rechargeable Ni-MH batteries. With a fully charged battery, after a couple dozen photos (some with flash, some not), the batteries read low. I continued to use it without the camera dying, so I assume it's conservative in it's battery level readout, or it's optimized for 1.5V alkaline batteries. No big deal, I didn't buy this for long photo shoots, just something I can give to the kids on trips and things, since it will be a cold day in the underworld before I buy my kids cell phones until midway into their teen years or later.; Ottima fotocamera, molto bella, leggera e non troppo grande, proprio come la volevo.
Dispone di diversi accessori come un coordino per poterla tenere al polso e di un cavetto per rendere ancora più semplice scaricare foto e video direttamente su un PC.
Utilizza due batterie AA da 1,5V ed è necessario acquistare un scheda SD da utilizzare come memoria (non in dotazione alla fotocamera).
Ci sono inoltre molte modalità di utilizzo e le foto / video vengono molto bene anche con scarsa illuminazione.

The 5K resolution it offers at such an affordable price is simply remarkable. I never thought I could get such excellent video quality without breaking the bank.

It's a fantastic tool for vlogging, capturing memories, and creating engaging content for my audience.

If you're in the market for an affordable yet high-quality action camera, I highly recommend giving the IZI Click a try. It's an incredible value for money, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase!; This is a very basic camera, very poor video quality also video flickering issue while recording,neither does it have any much function nor is the video quality so good, it would be better to visit a shop and buy it instead of buying it online. So that you can avoid wasting your money like me, Amazon has a return policy only if it is defective and not a refund.; Bought this on Summer sale for INR 8,499.

Overall, I highly recommend the IZI One PLus; You just need a high processing memory card otherwise 60FPS will not work
Video quality is very nice
Sound quality is okay but it cannot reduce noise
Battery is also good

The camera is not gud at all. Only good thing about this camera is accessories that we get with it, else everything is pooor. The main thing for which one buys an action camera is stabilization, which is worst in this camera.....dynamic range sucks ......a one minute video in 4k 60 fps takes 1 gb of storage which is too much as compared to the quality it delivers. I mean1 gb space for a video of 1 minute that too in poorest quality is way too much. Highly highly disappointed by this product. 5 hazaar or add karke DJI action 2 lena sahi hai.

Love the pictures; I had bought this as a gift for a loved one, with the intention of giving them an entrance into film photography. It is a point and shoot 35 mm with that disposable feel. Very beginner friendly, very intuitive.
It has turned out to be very nice for capturing moments and giving aesthetic Instagram photo dumps.
However, what you are paying for with this camera is 100% the aesthetics. Other similar film cameras can be found for far cheaper.
Buy it if you like the CONCEPT of film photography above all else, and maybe you may sink deeper into the hobby.; This was my first film camera and I’ve had so much fun with it. It’s compact, durable and easy to use. The instructions are very easy to understand and you just load it up and go. I use Kodak 400 35mm film and I’ve shared some of my favorite shots. I’ve got to learn how lightning/flash situations work but I honestly love the underlit grainy vibe from my results. I’ve never regretted this purchase and love it so so much!

Just be aware, with all film there is the risk of light fog which means you can lose those moments forever on film. It’s not the cameras fault however, so always have a back up photography option in the moment ex: your phone. 10/10 ⭐️; desde cuándo quería una cámara con un diseño así.

For its price range, the WT3130 offers commendable stability. It is well-suited for lightweight cameras, smartphones, and action cameras.

The WT3130 is designed with user-friendliness in mind. The flip-lock leg locks are easy to operate, and the quick-release plate allows for fast camera mounting and dismounting.

Paired it with sigma 18-50mm f2.8 instead of getting the kit lens.; I just got this camera like literally 15 mins ago , I've waited so long for this moment. I've been following up on sony since 2016 and a6400 and a6600 these two cameras have outworked every single camera out there . AF is unreal and if you're beginner but you do want a semi-proffesional camera a6400 is a must buy. I'll get the hang of it in few days will post updates here... But anyone who's looking to buy a mirrorless camera go for 6400 .; You can capture decent photos on this, but first of all you must understand it's limitations. You won't be able to achieve the dynamic range of a full frame on this but for the price its good enough.
For videos 1080p nowadays is outdated. And 4k is supported only at 30 fps. Moreover it records in 8-bit which you can extend a bit using s-log profiles. And no image Stabilization inbuilt.
Final verdict: Good for photos. Okayish for videos.
Build quality is good.

If you are starting and need one lens you can start with sony 18-105 f4, or, tamron 17-70 f2. 8. Tamron is bit more expensive but image quality is good.
After getting any one of the above lens. You can look for some prime especially 50mm f1.8 apsc from sony for potratis. And a sigma 16mm f1.4 or sony 15 mm f1.4 for wider angle to capture landscapes. Also these lenses will offer good clarity and low light capabilities.

You can check out more sample shots on my insta id aman_aditya; I like each and everything from this cute little camera, misses the IBIS though, but this is not a problem. For beginners or intermediate photographers, this is cheap and best, for advanced and pro photographers, this will be a backup camera. Best part is, autofocus, iso handling, dust and splash proof body. Must go for it, sony lovers.; For years i have been waiting to get a dslr , and i wanted to get the A6100 because its cheaper and pretty much similar to 6400 but then i chose this over the 6100 for 2 major reasons , better build quality and picture profiles (if you are serious about videography then its a must for you or else you can go for A6100) .

It has a great autofocus best in class , quick and sharp . The Sony's colour profile is also great. The build and feel of the camera is very good. The menus and overall UI is abit difficult to understand but you have to do alot of to and fros to get used to it.

I would suggest to get a body and then purchase lens separately as those kit lenses are useless anyway.; Far better than any other camera in this price range.; It's good for beginners like me.; Comes with small bag and 64gb sony memory card in the box, picture and video quality is great. Go for the body only and invest in a better lense like F1.8 50mm Sony or F1.4 16mm Sigma which are best and cheapest lenses for this camera as compared to other lenses."

But at half the price.
The 1 inch sensor coupled with 25-400 mm (35 mm equivalent) telephoto capability makes this camera perfect for any enthusiast photographer trying to find his own tastes.
Many beginners make the mistake of buying a DSLR with 18-50mm kit lens and get stuck with landscapes and portraits. Unless they are willing to spend double the cost to buy a telephoto lens, they usually leave the camera in the closet after a while.

But with Lumix Fz1000 Mark ii one can explore all aspects of beginner photography at half the cost.
You will always be taking this camera with you on any outing.

Pros:
1 inch sensor
25-400 Leica lens
More customizable controls, functions, dials than Sony Rx10 iv
Excellent LVF
Great articulating touch screen
Decent battery life
Great Cinelike profiles and RAW capabilities

Cons:
Lens a bit soft at telephoto end
No phase detect auto focus
No USB C 3.1

Verdict: Overall great value for money camera for enthusiastic photographers until they want to move on to something higher.; Some time zoom not working...zoom performance not satisfied...
In invoice not mensone serial number.
So warenty not clame.
This is my camera but in invoice not menson; I purchased a Panasonic Lumix DC-FZ10002 on October, 2023, for my holiday trip from another e-com website which was delivered inside a sealed box in working condition. I was able to take several photographs and record videos for the first few days without any problem.

However, while I was taking photographs during my trip, suddenly the autofocus stopped working and the display showed System Error (Focus). The problem lies in the autofocus mechanism, where the lens suddenly stops moving and an abrupt sharp mechanical noise is heard while lens is being extended prior to this failure mode. Since then, I have turned off the camera, removed the battery, reinserted it and tried to turn it on multiple times but the issue persisted. I decided to carry this bridge camera as my primary one since I had high expectations on the reliability of this device and as a result of the sudden malfunction, I was unable to capture any photograph during the rest of my trip.

Now, the real story begins when I emailed Panasonic India support regarding this issue. As the camera was under warranty, I was directed to visit Panasonic service centre on 28 October, 2023 and drop the camera at the authorised service centre for repair, which I did. Since then, nearly 1 (One) month has passed by the time I am writing this review on 26 November, 2023 and each time the service centre is contacted, their standard response is that due to unavailability of parts they are unable to complete the repair. I have been handling digital cameras and camera equipment for more than 20 years and this is the first time a brand-new camera has spectacularly failed within 15 days of purchase despite being handled with utmost care.

So, in summary, a brand-new Panasonic Lumix, which is not cheap by the way, develops a problem in the autofocus mechanism out of the blue within 15 days of purchase and brand authorised service centre is unable to repair the same due to unavailability of parts which, when and if, arrives at an unforeseeable future, might result in getting the camera back from service centre.

One might ask what will happen if some failure occurs after 5 or 10 years? I will leave that to your imagination."

Never buy it if the price is 15k; Excellent Product, Excellent quality for the price we pay.; Tripod is very heavy and good in quality, but umbrella is very bad.; Each individual product is good . No dispute from the seller . As professional photographer you need extra light along with porta . Stand , white umbrella are very good .You can avail a pair set within this price .

As I said, being as professional you need more bright Modeling Lamp - for that you need to pay more . But you can do creative photography with this bulb . For Phone video recording, light is enough.

Over all stand + umbrella are really awesome.. within this price .. need one more pair .; Don’t they offer bulbs and after buying bulbs worth 600 i got that it’s not reflective that way it shows in the picture.

Don’t go for fancy pictures.; Best for short film and photoshots. Need to improve bag quality.; "

Image quality is much better in low light, and the 40MP sensor gives way more options in post than the G9 20MP sensor. The auto-focus is much better than the G9 for everything except macro, where the X-H2 seems to focus just a little bit short -- e.g. on the nearest leg of an insect, rather than they eye or thorax -- even when using the ""insect detect"" feature added in firmware 3.0.

I'm not getting nearly the promised battery-life -- maybe ""battery life"" didn't factor in the AF power draw? -- so I'll have to buy spares to do a full day's shooting.

Be warned that Fuji RAW files are a challenge for some RAW processing programs -- Affinity Photo and Lightroom both produced desaturated and low-detail images from it -- so you should definitely use the freeware version of Capture One provided from Fuji. Its processing demands will strain ordinary laptop CPUs and older desktop CPUs too, and you will have to choose whether to put C1 on your laptop or desktop since the freeware version of C1 allows only one installation.

However, the SOOC Fuji jpegs are almost as good at dynamic range as what I can get from editing any half-way-decently-exposed RAW files, so I have fewer photos that I have to run through a full RAW processing regimen than I did with the G9.; Coming from the Fujifilm X-T3 , this camera feels more robust and easier to handle because of the large grip. I absolutely love shooting with it and I take it everywhere. With that being said, the looks and feel shouldn’t justify your purchase decision alone. I don’t shoot videos at all so I didn’t opt for the S version but this camera is certainly capable. The battery life is great compared to the XT3 and I love the always on display. The view finder is bright and crisp. The auto focus is very nice as well. With the 40 megapixels, I notice the difference when I crop images and zooming in to see the clarity and sharpness. I won’t be an amateur much longer. I feel like I have arrived when I shoot with this lol. No seriously, great camera. If you want to upgrade or just try it out you should. The price may be steep so your current camera may get the job done just fine.; Lots to like. Even has GPS that I didn’t knew it had. Coming from full frame Canon DSLR’s. Got the Fringer adapter for all my Canon lenses and they work well with it. The Jpegs coming right out of the camera are extremely nice with lots of film simulations to choose from. It may change how you think about raws on this camera. I would more heavily edit the raws on my Canon’s to get what I like, not so much on the XH2. Jpegs edit well but not really needed imagine that. Low light high iso is just ok, not quite like my full frames. The resolution is fantastic but the file sizes are large and will become an issue. More storage solutions coming my way. Kit lens is good but not stellar for this high resolution camera. Everything you would expect from a flag ship camera.; Never thought I would say this but the best multiuser camera I ever had the pictures are amazing the videos are extraordinary and even a novice can hold the camera steady and shaking is non existent the lens is heavy but perfect fit overall the best ever and I had and have many cameras; I've been shooting pictures and a little video since the film days. I've mainly used DSLR's and had some reservations switching to mirrorless cameras. This camera has put all my reservations to rest. The viewfinder provides an electronic view better than the best digital SLR cameras because of its electronically controlled brightness that shows what your actual picture will look like, or you can have it show the natural view like DSLR. The difference is that at 120 MHz, the view is just as good as a pentaprism used in a DSLR.
Secondly, it is somewhat lighter than an equivalent full frame camera since its APSC, but the pictures look just as good with the advances in sensor technology.
Fujifilm's latest lenses developed for the 40 MP sensor are fast and sharp edge to edge and priced less than equivalent full frame lenses.
I am in love with this system and this camera in particular, and the viewfinder was what finally sealed the deal for me."

Además, la calidad de las fotos está sujeta a la marca de pilas que se usen; se recomienda cambiar las que ya trae incluidas por unas Duracell.; Ela é linda, levinha, bem fácil de usar.

Bref, le Panasonic Lumix 25mm F1.7 est un excellent choix pour les photographes débutants ou intermédiaires en quête d'un objectif polyvalent, performant et abordable. Je le recommande vivement pour son excellent rapport qualité/prix.; Chi è figlio degli anni '70, come me, ma anche se si è ancora più anziani, ed è appassionato di fotografia, ricorderà i tempi in cui si mettevano da parte i risparmi per acquistare la prima fotocamera reflex. E la si prendeva, obbligatoriamente, con un obiettivo 50 mm.
Il cinquantino...
Un obiettivo economico, buono un po' per tutto, e dove non andava bene, lo si faceva bastare.
Poi, col tempo, e in base al budget, si espandeva il corredo, con dei grandangolari e dei teleobiettivi, rigorosamente a focale fissa.
L'arrivo degli zoom fu una rivoluzione, ma, a meno di non essere professionisti, oppure molto facoltosi, ci si doveva accontentare di obiettivi poco luminosi e dalla resa mediocre, o, al più, discreta.
Se si voleva luminosità e definizione, il 50 mm era ancora la scelta migliore.

Sono passati molti, molti, anni, ma la situazione non è cambiata. Gli zoom economici hanno migliorato molto la resa ottica, ma la luminosità rimane sempre limitata. Quindi, avere nella borsa fotografica un ""cinquantino"", è sempre un'ottima idea.
Ci sono zoom che battono il ""normale"", ma a che prezzo?

Col sistema micro 4/3, l'angolo di campo del 50 mm, è coperto dal 25 mm, perché le focali equivalenti di questo sistema, sono sempre la metà delle focali per pellicola 35 mm (adesso però, si chiama full frame).
Quindi questo Lumix 25 f/1.7, ricopre, nel sistema Lumix micro 4/3, il ruolo del 50 mm f/1.7 o f/1.8 nei sistemi full frame.
Un'ottica che consente di fare parecchie cose, a patto di avere lo spazio per allontanarsi dal soggetto, nel caso di paesaggi ed edifici, o di avvicinarsi nel caso di ritratti e soggetti piccoli. Ha un angolo di campo di 47° circa, e un'ingrandimento prossimo a 1x, quindi ricalca quello dell'occhio umano.
Luminoso, in modo da non dover aumentare l'impostazione iso per fare foto con un po' meno luce di quella solare, nitido, più della media degli zoom economici.
Un compagno fidato, insomma. L'obiettivo da montare quando lo zoometto di serie ""non ce la fa"".

Costa pochissimo, e rende tantissimo.

Ok, non è stabilizzato, ok, non è tropicalizzato, ok, è tutto in plastica, baionetta a parte, ma è una spada. Un piccolo ed economicissimo obiettivo da avere nella borsa fotografica di un sistema micro 4/3, Lumix o Olympus.
Tra l'altro pesa pochissimo.
In dotazione c'è anche un paraluce, molto efficace, con innesto a baionetta, che, ovviamente, accresce le dimensioni totali, ma può essere montato rovesciato per quando si ripone l'ottica. Un fatto curioso: l'ottica viene venduta con un ""anello estetico"" premontato, sulla baionetta destinata al paraluce. Per montare il paraluce va rimosso l'anello. Inutile dire che l'ho messo via e non lo monterò mai più.

L'obiettivo non è così piccolo come ci si aspetterebbe da un 25mm micro 4/3. Abituato con i 50 mm Pentax, questo 25 lumix, è perfino un po' più grande, ma molto più leggero.

A piena apertura, la resa è appena morbida verso i bordi, ma parliamo di f/1.7, quindi ci sta.
Diaframmando a f/4 la resa diventa tagliente dal centro ai bordi.
Con le fotocamere Lumix, come la mia G90, stabilizzate sul sensore, permette di scattare con tempi di posa di 1/8 di secondo, ottenendo foto ancora nitide.

La messa a fuoco, in AF, è silenziosissima, sempre rapida e affidabile.
In MF, il feeling è ""strano"" se si è abituati alle ghiere con collegamento meccanico alle lenti, perché qui è tutto motorizzato, ma non ci ho messo più di un minuto ad abituarmi, perché il sistema funziona molto bene.

Insomma, per me è un must have per chi ha una mirrorless Lumix. Esiste l'alternativa Olympus, ma costa parecchio di più, e alcune marche di concorrenza, ma per il prezzo richiesto per questo 25 f/1.7, direi che non è nemmeno il caso di prendere in considerazione altro.; Bra skärpa. Solskyddet kräver stor kraft vid montering.; Before buying this lens just be aware that it is a micro 4/3 lens which means it will only fit M4/3 camera (Lumix G and such) it won't fit full frame or APS-C without an adapter! Additionally M4/3 crop factor means that while this is a 25mm lens it is actually the equivalent to 50mm on a full frame camera.

Before I talk about what I like and don't like about this lens let me give you some context. (skip to the end for pros and cons)

Earlier in the year I purchased a Panasonic Lumix GH5 with the standard 12-60mm f/3.5 kit lens. I mainly use it for personal photo and video work, but have done some semi-professional projects with it too. And, while the kit lens is good it isn't amazing. It doesn't quite give you that professional outcome you desire when purchasing an expensive camera. I never quite got the bokeh effect (background blur) I wanted. I was a bit disappointed, and even thought about getting a new camera, since this wasn't giving me the result I wanted.

Additionally, I'm fairly new to this, and I know with the right know-how you can make even a cheap camera create amazing results, but I am still developing that skillset.

Fast forward a little, I did some research and looked into buying a new lens. I came across this 25mm (50mm equivalent) f/1.7 and realised it may give me a slightly better result. Safe to say it absolutely did. This lens completely saved my camera from being traded in and gave me the professional quality I sought after.

The images included were all taken with this lens and have not been edited. I couldn't believe the result all from slapping it on and using autofocus.

So let's talk about what works:
- Outstanding picture quality
- Quick and reliable autofocus (I have also tried this with video and the results blew me away)
- Amazing bokeh effect - can't stress how impresses I was with this
- Definitely great value for money

What could be improved?:
- Colours look a bit flat (honestly this could just be the way I have my camera set but things just don't look too vibrant)
- made of plastic - not really an issue for me but if you're particular about your lenses then you may want to spend more on a metal lens. But as I said, to me this doesn't really matter.

Hope this helps anyone researching cameras and lenses. If you have a M4/3 and want a lens to create a great bokeh effect for photo or video then you can't go wrong with this one.; 25mm is your normal view. Everything is quality. I use it with Olympus body since it adds stabilization and i don't want to take chances with blurry pictures. Phone cameras are getting very good, but you can still tell the difference when using a prime lens as quality is still unmatched."

Je le recommande vivement pour son excellent rapport qualité/prix.; Chi è figlio degli anni '70, come me, ma anche se si è ancora più anziani, ed è appassionato di fotografia, ricorderà i tempi in cui si mettevano da parte i risparmi per acquistare la prima fotocamera reflex. E la si prendeva, obbligatoriamente, con un obiettivo 50 mm.
Il cinquantino...
Un obiettivo economico, buono un po' per tutto, e dove non andava bene, lo si faceva bastare.
Poi, col tempo, e in base al budget, si espandeva il corredo, con dei grandangolari e dei teleobiettivi, rigorosamente a focale fissa.
L'arrivo degli zoom fu una rivoluzione, ma, a meno di non essere professionisti, oppure molto facoltosi, ci si doveva accontentare di obiettivi poco luminosi e dalla resa mediocre, o, al più, discreta.
Se si voleva luminosità e definizione, il 50 mm era ancora la scelta migliore.

Sono passati molti, molti, anni, ma la situazione non è cambiata. Gli zoom economici hanno migliorato molto la resa ottica, ma la luminosità rimane sempre limitata. Quindi, avere nella borsa fotografica un ""cinquantino"", è sempre un'ottima idea.
Ci sono zoom che battono il ""normale"", ma a che prezzo?

Col sistema micro 4/3, l'angolo di campo del 50 mm, è coperto dal 25 mm, perché le focali equivalenti di questo sistema, sono sempre la metà delle focali per pellicola 35 mm (adesso però, si chiama full frame).
Quindi questo Lumix 25 f/1.7, ricopre, nel sistema Lumix micro 4/3, il ruolo del 50 mm f/1.7 o f/1.8 nei sistemi full frame.
Un'ottica che consente di fare parecchie cose, a patto di avere lo spazio per allontanarsi dal soggetto, nel caso di paesaggi ed edifici, o di avvicinarsi nel caso di ritratti e soggetti piccoli. Ha un angolo di campo di 47° circa, e un'ingrandimento prossimo a 1x, quindi ricalca quello dell'occhio umano.
Luminoso, in modo da non dover aumentare l'impostazione iso per fare foto con un po' meno luce di quella solare, nitido, più della media degli zoom economici.
Un compagno fidato, insomma. L'obiettivo da montare quando lo zoometto di serie ""non ce la fa"".

Costa pochissimo, e rende tantissimo.

Ok, non è stabilizzato, ok, non è tropicalizzato, ok, è tutto in plastica, baionetta a parte, ma è una spada. Un piccolo ed economicissimo obiettivo da avere nella borsa fotografica di un sistema micro 4/3, Lumix o Olympus.
Tra l'altro pesa pochissimo.
In dotazione c'è anche un paraluce, molto efficace, con innesto a baionetta, che, ovviamente, accresce le dimensioni totali, ma può essere montato rovesciato per quando si ripone l'ottica. Un fatto curioso: l'ottica viene venduta con un ""anello estetico"" premontato, sulla baionetta destinata al paraluce. Per montare il paraluce va rimosso l'anello. Inutile dire che l'ho messo via e non lo monterò mai più.

L'obiettivo non è così piccolo come ci si aspetterebbe da un 25mm micro 4/3. Abituato con i 50 mm Pentax, questo 25 lumix, è perfino un po' più grande, ma molto più leggero.

A piena apertura, la resa è appena morbida verso i bordi, ma parliamo di f/1.7, quindi ci sta.
Diaframmando a f/4 la resa diventa tagliente dal centro ai bordi.
Con le fotocamere Lumix, come la mia G90, stabilizzate sul sensore, permette di scattare con tempi di posa di 1/8 di secondo, ottenendo foto ancora nitide.

La messa a fuoco, in AF, è silenziosissima, sempre rapida e affidabile.
In MF, il feeling è ""strano"" se si è abituati alle ghiere con collegamento meccanico alle lenti, perché qui è tutto motorizzato, ma non ci ho messo più di un minuto ad abituarmi, perché il sistema funziona molto bene.

Insomma, per me è un must have per chi ha una mirrorless Lumix. Esiste l'alternativa Olympus, ma costa parecchio di più, e alcune marche di concorrenza, ma per il prezzo richiesto per questo 25 f/1.7, direi che non è nemmeno il caso di prendere in considerazione altro.; Bra skärpa. Solskyddet kräver stor kraft vid montering.; Before buying this lens just be aware that it is a micro 4/3 lens which means it will only fit M4/3 camera (Lumix G and such) it won't fit full frame or APS-C without an adapter! Additionally M4/3 crop factor means that while this is a 25mm lens it is actually the equivalent to 50mm on a full frame camera.

Before I talk about what I like and don't like about this lens let me give you some context. (skip to the end for pros and cons)

Earlier in the year I purchased a Panasonic Lumix GH5 with the standard 12-60mm f/3.5 kit lens. I mainly use it for personal photo and video work, but have done some semi-professional projects with it too. And, while the kit lens is good it isn't amazing. It doesn't quite give you that professional outcome you desire when purchasing an expensive camera. I never quite got the bokeh effect (background blur) I wanted. I was a bit disappointed, and even thought about getting a new camera, since this wasn't giving me the result I wanted.

Additionally, I'm fairly new to this, and I know with the right know-how you can make even a cheap camera create amazing results, but I am still developing that skillset.

Fast forward a little, I did some research and looked into buying a new lens. I came across this 25mm (50mm equivalent) f/1.7 and realised it may give me a slightly better result. Safe to say it absolutely did. This lens completely saved my camera from being traded in and gave me the professional quality I sought after.

The images included were all taken with this lens and have not been edited. I couldn't believe the result all from slapping it on and using autofocus.

So let's talk about what works:
- Outstanding picture quality
- Quick and reliable autofocus (I have also tried this with video and the results blew me away)
- Amazing bokeh effect - can't stress how impresses I was with this
- Definitely great value for money

What could be improved?:
- Colours look a bit flat (honestly this could just be the way I have my camera set but things just don't look too vibrant)
- made of plastic - not really an issue for me but if you're particular about your lenses then you may want to spend more on a metal lens. But as I said, to me this doesn't really matter.

Hope this helps anyone researching cameras and lenses. If you have a M4/3 and want a lens to create a great bokeh effect for photo or video then you can't go wrong with this one.; 25mm is your normal view. Everything is quality. I use it with Olympus body since it adds stabilization and i don't want to take chances with blurry pictures. Phone cameras are getting very good, but you can still tell the difference when using a prime lens as quality is still unmatched."

It brought her to tears when opened the gift. Weeks later the parents told me that she said it is very easy to use and uses it all the time. And the quality of the picture and video is very high. So glad I chose this camera as a gift!; First thing to note it's not an expensive camera. If you want an expensive camera go spend $1000 on a Canon or Nikon. I do look fo a certain level of quality. For around $100 this was perfect. Bought a similar camera last year about the same price. I abuse cameras and that one broke out of the box and had a lot of super glue on it. This one feels more durable. But I just took it out of the box. I tend to abuse cameras. I feel confident about this one.

Screen quality: passable. Not super cheap but not 4K.

On board mic quality: Decent. Not a studio mic quality but if I forget my external mic it will be passable. If I wasn’t publishing video it would suffice.

Video/photo quality: really good over all quality. Vibration reduction stinks. Not a walking around camera or a good handheld. But takes sharp images.

Cons. No firmware updates. And a lot of glitches. Will not stay connected to my computer. Have to use a separate card reader. Had some glitches on the photos. The telephoto lens provided is useless

External mic port has a bad humming noise. I have tried multiple mics they all turn out the same. Amazon approved a replacement. We'll see if it was just that unit.

Got unit 2 tried multiple external mics. Same issue. This one is getting returned.; The camera itself feels cheap and like a child’s toy. It does come with 2 batteries which is nice. I took multiple pictures inside and outside and compared them to my iPhone 12 max and the iPhone was way better. I was hoping for an option instead of my phone but this one did not work out. The pictures were ok but the colors and clarity just weren’t as sharp and vibrant as the iPhone. The zoom did work well. I returned the camera.; This camera is beginner-friendly with a 48-megapixel resolution and 4K video capability. Its 8-megapixel CMOS sensor ensures good image quality, and the 3-inch screen is handy for framing shots.

Worse service by amazon for this order. Dont buy.; This is multipurpose device if you love travelling or you are a regular traveller then you should have it; Feel like I am having magic stick in my hand. One of the amazing product.; Ho recentemente acquistato la Insta360 X3 360 e sono rimasto semplicemente sbalordito dalla sua performance e versatilità. Questa fotocamera ha portato la mia esperienza di fotografia e videografia a un livello completamente nuovo, anche se comporta nuove modalità di ripresa a cui non ero abituato.
Iniziamo con il design. La Insta360 X3 360 è compatta e leggera, il che la rende facile da trasportare ovunque. La qualità costruttiva è solida, e si nota subito che è un prodotto di alta qualità. Gli accessori inclusi, come il treppiede e la custodia protettiva, sono ben realizzati e completano l'esperienza di utilizzo.

Ma ciò che rende davvero eccezionale questa fotocamera è la sua capacità di catturare immagini e video a 360 gradi in modo straordinario. La qualità delle immagini è sorprendente, con colori vibranti e dettagli nitidi. La modalità 360 gradi offre una prospettiva completamente nuova su ogni scena, consentendo di catturare non solo ciò che si trova di fronte a te, ma tutto intorno. Questo è un vero e proprio cambiamento di paradigma nella fotografia.

La stabilizzazione dell'immagine è fenomenale. Anche durante i movimenti o le riprese in condizioni di luce scarsa, le immagini rimangono stabili e nitide. Questo è particolarmente importante quando si scattano video, poiché garantisce una visione fluida e professionale.

La connettività Wi-Fi e Bluetooth è un vantaggio significativo. Ho potuto collegare facilmente la fotocamera al mio smartphone android attraverso l'app Insta360, il che mi ha permesso di controllare la fotocamera, visualizzare le immagini in tempo reale e condividerle immediatamente sui social media. Questa funzionalità è estremamente comoda ed efficiente, ma l'esperienza con il collegamento con un iPAD è - ahimé nettamente superiore.

La durata della batteria non è particolarmente performante. Ho potuto utilizzare la Insta360 X3 360 durante un crociera in barca a vela: consente riprese per l'intera mattinata a condizione che la SD montata sia particolarmente capiente (ne ho installata una da 256GB). La Insta360 X3 è anche resistente all'acqua, il che la rende adatta per l'utilizzo in ambienti esterni e in condizioni meteorologiche avverse. Questo è un plus valore non da poco.

L'applicazione Insta360 è altamente intuitiva e ricca di funzionalità. Mi ha permesso di personalizzare le impostazioni, applicare filtri e effetti speciali alle mie foto e ai miei video in modo semplice e divertente. Inoltre, l'app offre una vasta gamma di opzioni di editing che mi hanno consentito di creare contenuti davvero unici.

In conclusione, la Insta360 X3 è una fotocamera rivoluzionaria che ha superato le mie aspettative. La sua capacità di catturare immagini e video a 360 gradi, la qualità delle immagini, la stabilizzazione e la connettività sono tutte caratteristiche che la rendono una scelta eccezionale per chiunque voglia portare la propria creatività fotografica e videografica a nuove vette. Non posso che raccomandare caldamente questa fotocamera a tutti gli appassionati di fotografia e videografia: è una vera e propria rivoluzione nel mondo della cattura di immagini.; I am absolutely blown away by the Insta360 camera! This device has redefined my photography and videography experience. The versatility it offers is unmatched. From capturing breathtaking 360-degree landscapes to producing incredibly smooth and stabilized action shots, it delivers beyond expectations.The image and video quality are outstanding. The details are sharp, the colors are vibrant, and the stitching of the 360-degree images is seamless. It's like having a professional-grade camera in the palm of your hand.The app integration is smooth and user-friendly, allowing me to control the camera remotely and easily edit my shots. The real-time preview feature is a game-changer, ensuring that I always get the perfect shot.What sets the Insta360 apart is its exceptional stabilization technology. Even in fast-paced scenarios, the footage remains steady and free from any shakes. This feature alone puts it ahead of many other action cameras on the market.The battery life is impressive, giving me ample time to capture all the moments I want without worrying about running out of power.Whether you're an amateur looking to elevate your content or a professional seeking innovative tools, the Insta360 camera is an investment you won't regret. It's compact, durable, and offers a level of creativity that's hard to find elsewhere. I can confidently say that this camera deserves every bit of its 5-star rating.Kudos to the Insta360 team for creating a product that truly revolutionizes how we capture the world around us.; Se pretende uma camera 360 para viajar, a X3 deve ser tia em conta.
Tenho usado para documentar os meus passeios e a qualidade de imagem é excelente com boa luz e aceitável em ambientes de pouca luz. Atenção que sendo uma camera 360 implica passar algum tempo a editar video para que se poder ver de um modo ""normal"".; Super Aufnahmen im Rundumblick. Ein neues Erlebnis mal seine motorradfahrt aus einem neuen Winkel betrachten. Auch die App funktioniert super.; Fantastische camera. Vraagt wel wat oefening om de opnames te editen. Maar groot voordeel dat je geen pc nodig hebt. Uiteraard kan dat wel. Op fiets of motor in alle standen te monteren zonder rekening te hoeven houden of je onderwerp wel in beeld komt. Is daarmee de ideale reis- en actiecamera."

La única área de oportunidad es que todavía funciona con pilas y que el flash siempre se activa aunque haya buena exposición de luz, si se pudiera activar/desactivar el flash a discreción estaría mejor. Además, la calidad de las fotos está sujeta a la marca de pilas que se usen; se recomienda cambiar las que ya trae incluidas por unas Duracell.; Ela é linda, levinha, bem fácil de usar. Vale super a pena, a única parte ruim é o preço dos filmes mesmo kkkkkkkk (e ainda acabei usando um a toa porque tirei foto do chão sem querer), mas super vale a experiência e o carinho de guardar momentos em fotos reveladas!!!"

Risultava sprovvisto anche di scheda. Ma anche qui potevo passarci sopra. Procedo alla ricarica delle 12 ore. L'accendo e la macchina funziona giusto 3 secondi il tempo di una foto di prova, poi da quel momento praticamente morta.

Così ho dato un'occhiata alle recensioni ( cosa che non avevo fatto prima ) e ho notato che è un problema di molti.

L'ho resa puntualmente. Consiglio di stare lontana da questo fornitore in quanto continua a spedire macchine difettate anche dopo le recensioni negative.

4. Although the panel can be mounted on a tripod in horizontal as well as vertical position, I am unlikely to use it in vertical position.

My sole purpose was lens protection as digital cameras do not require UV filter.

Though it is priced very competetive and also claimed to have multilayered coating, I noticed significant depreciation in image quality at the 600 mm length in compared to images taken without. I never realized why my photos were not coming crystal clear while I use the latest full frame camera Sony Alpha 7C. It was only when a senior photographer and Sony ambassador suggested to try the photographs without the filter. And it worked withoutthe filter. Well, A7C has got an internal Anti-alias filter and using a UV filter on telephoto range may be the factor behind deteriorating in my case. Others may get different output. I would suggest using this filter only if absolutely necessary such as dusty and windy situation or walking through thorny forests , else the lens hood will be enough for protection of your lens.
One more thing, this filter also gets smudges very easily. So overall I wont recommend this.; Close up clarity too good; Images are blurred out defeating the sole purpose. If the image isn't usable then what is the point ?
I would not recommend this to anyone.
No wonder this product cannot be returned.; I have ordered this filter for Nikkor 200-500 lens , with the filter on the image quality reduces and I mages becomes soft even at iso 100 .

I came to the conclusion that this is defected. Neither does it charges nor it works.; Mi sono stupito del fatto che i supporti presenti in confezione con la GoPro non fossero compatibili con gli attacchi a vite standard per apparecchi fotografici.

Prodotto ben realizzato, buoni materiali, solido e fa bene quello per cui è realizzato.; Rien à redire, ces adaptateurs pour GoPro font leur taf, juste peut-être un prix un peu élevé pour de simples morceaux de plastique, mais le contrat est rempli.; Definately sturdy enough, and easy to fit my Go pro to the standard mount for the tripod I already had.

Lo uso para colocar la gopro en un gorillapod y ningún problema, encaja todo perfectamente, resiste los movimientos que le des y como he dicho antes, no da sensación de que sea material débil o que se vaya a romper.

Lo mejor es el precio, que he visto en tiendas físicas adaptadores parecidos que se van a veinte euros, solo por ser para gopro... este no tiene nada que envidiar, cumple su función y tiene un precio razonable tratándose realmente de un trozo de plástico.

100% recomendable, es el mejor adaptador en relación calidad precio.; Si eres aficionado al video y tienes la fortuna de tener una o varias Gopro yo creo que estos accesorios son vitales ya que te permiten utilizar cualquier accesorio para cámara normal o DSLR, poder utilizarla con un tripie genérico puede ser la diferencia entre cargar mucho equipo a una sesión o llevar y comprar algo especifico para cada cámara.

Los materiales son de plástico ambos pero se nota que su construcción esta bien hecha y que aguantan un uso más rudo de lo habitual, ademas de que es ligero.

En general no hay mucho que decir además de que si vale la pena aún cuando sea para estar prevenido en caso de tener que usar diferentes monturas o poder adaptarlo a equipo de fotografía mas especializado."

The kit lens is as such a very general lens and you need to buy a prime lens to get the feel of photography and shoot good portraits. You always have options to buy sophisticated lens made for the purpose but being tight on budget and love towards trying new things i stopped on this lens. You can either buy sony's e mount lens or buy an adaptor and use lenes of other mounts. This being dirt cheap, i tried my hand on it and found it utter amazing. You can check its review in the link i mentioned.
Pros-
-compact and sturdy body. Full metal and glass.
-gives a good bokeh effect.
-fully manual.
- can replace your kit lens :)
Cons-
- clarity is in the center and gives a toy effect to photographs. Its not really a down side if you like taking such pics.
-it is imported from US so it might take 15 days for delivery
-no lens cap; using it with sony a 7 mark I, works like charm, good build quality, cheap and best!! using it for closeup and some macro shots. fully satisfied!!; Product is awesome but taken too much time to deliver. But, still I am satisfied; Circular Bokeh is cool. Metal body with good build quality. Lens can be easily taken apart. Flares unpredictably. MF and clickless aperture is good. Suitable for soft dreamy video/portrait. Infinity focus stopped working after a day or two and gets stuck if I try to do so. Cheap lens for mirrorless cameras as a toy/special effect glass. Shipping time and sticky inf. focus = 3/5. If both sorted, quite worth it. I used it on a Sony A6000.; For the price it's an amazing lens , produces some really dreamy and swirly bokeh. The focus plane is not flat . The pictures gets blurry on the corners at lower F stops . But does the job ✌ For more pictures from this lens checkout my Instagram page @ecstaticcontrast . Happy Clicking 😊; Its a good lens to have the feeling of a prime lens.; This Lens is good for portrait photography.
Outcome of picture is sharp at center,
Fun to use.

Cons:-
packaging is not so good.
Take more than a month for delivery @ Chennai
There is no back cover for the lens.; Awesome lens for the price.; First of all let me just say this:
if you are on the fence about buying this lens, DONT THINK JUST BUY PLEASE YOU WONT REGRET IT!!! Especially at such a low price!

it’s ridiculous how good this lil piece of glass is. Seriously. I shoot a whole variety of different kinds of things, mostly nature, animals, and sometimes people(and soon cars too). This lens is amazing for all three and more. I use it on my Sony Alpha A6100 and the photos I’ve been able to capture this past summer have been some of my favorite shots I’ve taken, since I got my first camera last fall. I have loads more shots on my Instagram: @ cloudformedia if you’re intrigued by the sample photos I’ve provided.
I’ll now go a bit further and speak on sharpness, ease of focusing, build quality, etc.

sharpness: wow, just,
Wow.
it’s honestly insane how sharp of shots you can manage to squeeze out of this lens. I normally use a Sony SEL 50mm f/1.8 for a lot of my work and this honestly holds up to that $250 lens a fair bit. It is however, soft in the corners, but that can actually work to your advantage in most cases(keep reading to find out why!)
Bokeh: ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL AND UNIQUE
Did the creators of this lens rip off of vintage powerhouses like the Helios 44??? If you’re at all familiar with vintage lenses, you’ll know about the unique bokeh and background blur effects you can get with lenses like the Russian Helios as previously mentioned. This lens, somehow, manages to replicate that sweet, sweet, swirly bokeh that you can usually only get with old glass. It’s absolutely beautiful. I don’t know how aperture blades work, or rlly anything as it pertains to the engineering behind that sort of thing, but man, this lens gives you some stunning bokeh for sure.
TLDR It’s a banger of a portrait lens(especially at this focal length!)

Ease of focusing: first of all, if you buy any manual focus lenses like this one, go into your camera settings and turn on focus peaking, and then thank me lager. I actually started out with manual focus lenses, and while it can take a bit getting used to, it’ll become relatively easy and quite fun in a short amount of time. I nail about 80% of the shots I’ve gotten with this lens. It’s very easy to focus in my experience. I usually dial the aperture down to around f/1.8 or f/2.0, but even at f/1.7 it’s still pretty dang sharp. Focusing itself is quite easy, this isn’t any sort of manual focus zoom. Basically, as long as you have focus peaking turned on, you should get the hang of it in no time. Not to mention how rewarding it can feel when you nail a killer shot, knowing you did so with your own hands!

Build quality: now this is where, unfortunately, I have to delve into the small negatives of this lens. First of all, It does feel sturdy in the hands, has a nice weight to it, when you consider the size. However, I have experienced some jamming(?) when trying to change the focus, it sort of locks up and loosens a bit(if that makes sense lol). Though, it only seemed to do that for a small amount of time, strangely enough. These days however, it hasn’t done any of that sort of “jamming” much at all(I’ve had this lens for a year, however I just started using it again about a month ago). Then again, what more could you expect from a $28-35 lens for your $300-$1k+ mirrorless camera?????

All in all, I think this lens is an absolute steal. You get a stylishly portable form factor which makes it great for traveling, some fantastic bokeh that looks especially beautiful in portraits, insane sharpness(all things considered, that is), and a very sleek looking piece of glass that’ll remind you of the lenses of yesteryear. Overall, this lens is an extremely worthwhile investment for any photographer imo, I recommend anyone looking to add a bit of flair to their photos, to try this lens. especially at this price point!; The box was bent but the lens is in good condition. It also arrived 2 days prior to the expected date which is a plus point for me.; This is a great little lens, it has a style that regular lenses like the nifty fifty by Canon and the 50mm by Sony cannot replicate, the Bokeh is buttery smooth and low light performance is fantastic with the 1.7 aperture. As great as this lens is there are some things you need to be aware of, image is very soft around the edges at 1.7 so unless you're doing products or you're going for that dream state style I would suggest shooting at 2.0-2.5, this is not meant to be a lens for the Sony mirror less system so you may find some vignetting but this can be fixed by cropping in a bit.

Overall I have to say this is a fantastic product and for anyone looking for a low cost lens that has a unique style I would highly recommend this one.; Excellent item. You can take really good photos with it. I was expecting it to be plastic, however, it's metal, heavier than expected.
It came with a small bag and some extra covers for the lenses and frame.
For the price, it an excellent item.; Para ser sinceros, al ver el precio de este producto por primera vez, ni siquiera lo consideré; sin embargo no sé como volví a la página y empecé a leer las reseñas, la gran mayoría le dan buena calificación.

Estuve a punto de comprar un lente Sony 50mm 1.8 con un costo aproximado de $4,500. Sin embargo me topé con este lente, decidí darle una oportunidad. Tomando en cuenta el precio decidí arriesgarme.

En cuanto tuve el producto me sorprendió la calidad de los materias, ya que no tiene esa sensación de producto barato, al contrario, el lente se siente muy solido incluso hasta resistente a golpes, parece un lente de un precio mucho mayor.

El adaptador sinceramente pensé que sería de plástico, sin embargo es del mismo material del lente (una sensación metálica), que cabe a la perfección tanto en la cámara como en el lente.

Obviamente este lente no trae las opciones que un lente Sony tendría como el auto enfoque, además en mi cámara (Alpha 6300) tengo que activar la opción ""Liberar sin Objetivo"" ya que la cámara no detecta que tiene un lente puesto, esto debido a que el lente es completamente manual.

Tomen en cuenta el factor de recorte del sensor, que para mi cámara con APS-C es 1.5x, por lo que con esta lente de 1.5 X 35mm = 52.5 mm ""efectivos"". La relación focal, según el fabricante, es F1.7 por lo que se cataloga como un lente luminoso capaz de hacer el popular Efecto Bokeh.

Me parece un excelente lente para empezar a practicar y cumple con lo que buscaba en el lente. Así que no le puedo dar menos de 5 estrellas."

I'm a novice photographer, however I am very pleased with the quality of photos I can get with this camera, and I still haven't figured out all the settings yet.
For a ""Budget"" full body camera this thing is a beast. Great for novice photographers. Canon's UI is also pretty user friendly. Would recommend.; I previously had a Canon T3i and I absolutely loved that thing. It was amazing the results that camera could do for its time and I will always think it's one of the best budget cameras ever made. However, I've recently gotten more into video and that is one thing the T3i wasn't meeting my needs for. It was missing so many features like autofocus and modern video resolutions and frame rates.

Therefore, my search for a new camera began. I seriously debated nearly every camera in this price range from every manufacturer. Sony, Fujifilm, Panasonic, you name it. However, it seemed like they all had one fatal flaw to them. Sony with their weird coloring, Fujifilm with the overheating issues, Panasonic with the awful autofocus. Some were better at photos, some were better at video. However, I needed something that would do great with both, as I wanted this to be something I could shoot professional portraits with but also shoot vlogs. At the end of the day, all signs pointed to this camera, and I'm so glad this is the one I chose.

I'm not a super-advanced user, however, I do think I've moved past the beginner stage of photography and videography. I think this camera really fits me perfectly as I'm not incredibly overwhelmed with options and features that I don't know how to use, but it still has a ton of capability that allows me to learn more about photography and videography. I've also just been using the 24-105 kit lens that comes with this bundle on Amazon.

The video on this is amazing. HUGE step up from the T3i. The face detecting autofocus works great and nearly all of my shots are perfectly in focus unless it's super dark which it has a little more of a struggle with but obviously any camera would. I was a little hesitant about the fairly disabled 4k capability with this camera due (disabled dual pixel AF, crop factor, 30 min time limit, 24 fps max) especially since other cameras in the price range have a more robust 4k capability. However, I've found that 1080p meets my needs just fine and looks absolutely gorgeous. It's also much more friendly on the file size and processing in video editing.

The photo capability has shocked me even more than the video. I knew this would obviously be a great camera for photos, but I didn't realize what a step up from my T3i it would be. I honestly thought my T3i photos would look just about as good as this camera since the T3i does admittedly take amazing photos. However, this blows it out of the water. The autofocus on this is SO much better. With the T3i, fast moving subjects were nearly impossible to get in focus. This does so much better. The full-frame sensor on this camera makes a huge difference too. The low light performance is so much better and the size of these photos is insane. You can zoom in to the photos so much and it's still amazingly clear.

As for the body of the camera itself, it feels incredibly well made. Grabbing my T3i now feels like a cheap plastic toy compared to this thing. It feels very solid and durable. The grip on the camera is incredibly easy and comfortable to hold.

The only negative thing I've encountered so far is the kit lens that comes with this bundle doesn't have a physical switch between autofocus and manual focus. You have to go into the camera settings to switch between them. I don't find myself doing this very often as the autofocus is amazing but when I do need manual focus it's a little bit of an inconvenience.

Overall, it's an amazing camera and I'm very happy that I went with this one.; Camera its self is ok, but that’s less is not worth it. Skip the lens and buy ef lens or some f2 lens
Don not buy with f 4-7 lenses, useless"

I have ordered one on last month and they have supplied a fully charged battery. I just have checked only if the battery was working and found it well. After two weeks, I used this for a telefilm shoot; and put this for charging after the charge was drained-off. It was a shocking incident as the original charger doesn't support this battery. I could not finish the project on time and I returned this piece on the next day to amazon.

I ordered a new battery at the same time, thinking the problem was just with this particular piece. This time I checked charging compatibility at the next moment of its receipt. It was showing the same problem and I realised the battery is not compatible for the original charger. Then I thought to purchase the charger being offered by Digitek and I received it today. It works well with this battery. Moreover, the charger supports the original battery too.

REMEMBER, YOU NEED TO SPEND ANOTHER 600-700 BUCKS TO BUY ANOTHER CHARGER TO USE THIS BATTERY.

Battery is working well, and the charge holding capacity is also seemed to be good at this moment. If you already have Digitek charger, it’s a worth-buy! (I’d have given 5 stars for “VALUE FOR MONEY” if it was compatible with the original charger); ये atom replce करके एक महिना हो चुका है

I recently purchased a Digitek camera battery, hoping for a reliable and efficient power source for my Canon camera. However, I am deeply disappointed to report that the Digitek Battery is simply not up to par when it comes to charging compatibility with the Canon charger.

Despite the manufacturer's claims of compatibility, my Digitek Battery consistently fails to charge when using the Canon charger. This not only defeats the purpose of investing in a spare battery but also raises serious concerns about the quality and reliability of Digitek products.

I have attempted to troubleshoot the issue by ensuring proper connections and using different charging outlets, but to no avail. The Digitek Battery continues to resist charging with the Canon charger, leaving me frustrated and without a reliable backup power source for my camera.

To add to the frustration, the customer support from Digitek has been less than satisfactory. Attempts to reach out for assistance have been met with slow response times and generic, unhelpful suggestions. It's disheartening to invest in a product that not only fails to deliver on its promises but also lacks adequate customer support to address the issues faced by users.

In conclusion, I would strongly caution potential buyers to reconsider purchasing the Digitek camera battery, especially if they intend to use it with a Canon charger. The lack of charging compatibility, coupled with subpar customer support, makes this product a regrettable choice. Save yourself the hassle and look for more reliable alternatives in; Can be used as a cost effective backup to the main Canon LP-E10 battery. Lasts for roughly 60-70% of the original one. Came in a plastic box with broken seal, the protective plastic inside was also torn. But the battery had no visible signs of usage, no scratches on the connectors. Charges from 0-100% in 2hrs 30 mins using the original Canon charger & retains the charge efficiently, discharging normally. Amazon's product description says 03 months warranty provided but no warranty card provided in the box. The battery is slightly slimmer than the original. Hence, it smoothly fits into the battery cavity. But it cannot be considered as a total replacement for the original one.; No need to worry on battery going down if you have a fully charged secondary battery on hand!; I had bought 2 nos. of lp e10 for Canon eos 1500D
1. Little bit heating issue.
2. Slow charging with other brand charger, I recommend digitek compitable charger for it.
3. It can click atleast 300+ photos as per uses.
4. For video you must have extra one.
5. Product packaging was very nice i.e. plastic case (box).
Conclusion: Go for it, it's a good product.!!
6.; Nice battery packing , awesome battery backup, product is value for money thank you Amazon"

Great Little Remote!!

My Camera : Canon 5D Mark III
(no setup required, just turn on 2 sec timer/remote option in 'Drive Mode'/Shooting Mode')

This remote worked from both front & behind. (also above and below)
If you are standing in front of camera range is 15 to 20 feet.
If you are standing behind the camera range is 6 to 8 feet.
I also tried it from above the camera & below it. Works in both scenarios.
Which means = 360degree firing range! WOW!!!

PFA : I have added pictures of unboxing & for comparison.

I love this lightweight and sturdy addition to my Canon ecosystem. Use it to eliminate vibration. Especially for shots that need long exposures and/or are of far-away objects, using the remote shutter trigger really helps to keep the blur down. Also for taking group shots off of a tripod. Allows me to get in the shot with very little effort. It's absolutely perfect for my camera. It's small enough to hold in my hand when taking a picture of myself and it won't be seen in the picture.

You already know how expensive DSLR equipment can be, anything with ""Photography"" attached to the name is instantly marked up 3x it's value.. When it comes to Camera accessories, it's never cheap, and if it is cheap, quite frankly it's garbage... Not in this case!

Just make sure when ordering that you select the correct camera, as there are two choices in the drop down menu, either Canon or Nikon.

PROs:
- Range 10 - 16 feet (but could easily go to 20ft in range!)
- CR2 battery included is very good! lasts a long long time. - Don't think I've ever had to change the battery cell.
- Ergonomics: Small enough to hide from the frame (unlike Canon RC-6 wireless remote, which is slimmer but wider, and might be visible while holding)
- Comes with a nice carrying case
- The price is unbeatable

Function: In my experience, both Canon & AmazonBasics performed the same. You will be needing the time to ""hide"" the remote away. Therefore I prefer the couple seconds delay option, which both remotes offer.

How to Setup : Switch the timer to ""remote/10 sec"" in your camera settings.

Select the Q button on the side of the camera where you have all your other functions and when your touch screen appears touch the area where you can change your shooting mode (drive mode). Once there select the 5th icon from the left that has the remote symbol and the self timer icon and you are all set.

Instructions for Video :
1) Flick the switch to ""on"" mode, NOT ""video"" mode (I think that's what the one with the camera icon is called?)
2) Disable the auto shut-off in the menu
3) Close the menu and click the left navigational button to access the timer
4) Switch the timer to ""remote/10 sec""
5) Flick the switch to ""video"" mode(?)
6) Push the button to record!

I hope this makes sense and is helpful!

It also works great in BULB mode for long exposures. Press it once to open the shutter, and press it again to close the shutter when you're ready. After the first press, the timer will be displayed on the top LCD display.

There's nothing especially fancy about this, but gets the job done, it's very light, and it doesn't take up much space in my camera bag. No complaints at all, so far.

Packaging : It came in a tiny box, which the remote was stored in a tiny black bag and it also came with instructions. The battery life is....well damn, it's great! I haven't had to change it since I have purchased it. The material of the remote is plastic, while the button is rubber, so I would say if you're rough with it. It's bound to break at some point. I haven't dropped it on anything hard so it's been fine with dropping on carpet. The durability is about what you would expect from a plastic remote.

How it works? : It communicates with the camera via IR, just like a TV remote, so it must have clear line of site to the camera in order to operate. This means that if you want to be in the picture you’ll either need to be creative in how you hide the remote without covering it or you can use a short delay timer to give you a few seconds to put it in your pocket after you press the button.

Also, this unit replaced a Canon branded remote and the Amazon Basics unit is a much better device at half the price. It has a much better IR transmitter so it is much less fickle about how close your aim is. The Canon remote required nearly perfect aim to get the shutter to activate.

RECOMMENDATION:
Highly recommended. Get this one if you want to save a few bucks (compared to the OEM remote). A must have in every camera bag! I recommend this product for anyone looking to upgrade their photography experience. Makes taking self-photos much easier and it's great for aiding in producing video blogs. No more getting up and pressing record. You can record or take photographs right from your seat.

If this review guided & helped you! Please do leave a thumbs up! :)

Happy Clicking!!!; Bought two of these, and didn't think for a moment that they could be defective, since I've generally had good experience with AmazonBasics products. Tested them as soon as they arrived with my Canon EOS M3, and they didn't work. I thought my camera may have some issues, so tested on an EOS 7D, but they didn't work with it either. Thought that was because the 7D was old. Finally got an EOS M6 today to test these against, and the remotes didn't work with that either. Now I'm sure that these remotes don't actually work. I can't return them now, since due to my trust in AmazonBasics, I hesitated to return them immediately. And today, when I finally confirmed that these don't work, I went to raise a return request only to find that the return window closed yesterday. Not sure if I'll trust any AmazonBasics products again.; People complaining about this product not working did exactly what I did at first. Take it out of the box and start using immediately.
Please go through the documentation enclosed and watch online videos first.

Light pocketable product. Good range if the line of sight is clear. Battery lasts long. Works as a remote control, as intended. I am using it to shoot pics using my zoom lens since I have shaky hands.

Cons: sets off the red eye flasher which may be distracting. This is the reason it takes a while to click the photo.

Good product for the price. Works well. Cheers to Amazon basics line of products!; ; Decent item, tiny package, smooth delivery. BUT. Does not work with Canon EOS 700D as advertised. Firmware 14.1.; It works like a flow. No glitches, no delay, nothing. Doesn't feel it is not a part of the camera. I use a Canon EOS 700 D and the sync is superb. I really liked the product. Of course, another may have a negative experience with the product. But for me, till now, this has worked beautifully; The product does come with batteries and I had just used it once before it stopped working. Overall pretty mediocre; Update 5th April: I changed my rating to 5 Star as I found the remote works really good for my Canon 6D. I tested it from 15 feet front and works good, from the back side it works from close range.
*How to get it to work* - Put your camera on a 2-sec Timer and point the remote at the Camera IR sensor. A red IR light will light up and the shutter will release after 2 Sec. Voila.; Ho acquistato il Telecomando wireless AmazonBasics per la mia macchina fotografica Canon, ed è stato un acquisto che ha aggiunto un tocco di convenienza al mio repertorio fotografico. Questo telecomando, progettato per fotocamere reflex digitali Canon, offre una soluzione semplice ed economica per attivare l'otturatore a distanza, eliminando le vibrazioni indesiderate e consentendo scatti nitidi e chiari.

Esperienza d'uso:
Il telecomando è super sottile e leggero, rendendo facile tenerlo a portata di mano. L'attivazione dell'otturatore senza dover premere alcun pulsante sulla fotocamera è un vantaggio significativo, soprattutto quando si affrontano soggetti difficili da fotografare o quando si desidera catturare autoritratti. Ho trovato particolarmente utile la sua efficacia nelle situazioni in cui ridurre al minimo le vibrazioni è fondamentale per ottenere immagini chiare e nitide. La portata operativa è adeguata per la maggior parte delle situazioni, come scatti di gruppo o foto in cui il fotografo desidera fare parte dell'immagine.

Compatibilità:
È importante notare che il telecomando è compatibile solo con una selezione di modelli di fotocamere Canon, tra cui EOS 5DSR, EOS 5DS, EOS 5D Mark4, EOS 5D Mark3, EOS 5D Mark2, EOS 6D Mark2, EOS 6D, EOS R6, EOS R5, EOS 7D Mark2 e altri elencati nella descrizione. Quindi, prima dell'acquisto, assicurati che la tua fotocamera rientri tra quelli compatibili.

Imballaggio Eco-friendly:
Apprezzo l'impegno di AmazonBasics nei confronti dell'ambiente, come dimostrato dall'imballaggio apertura facile. Questo approccio riduce l'uso della plastica e delle fascette di plastica, contribuendo a ridurre gli sprechi e a preservare le risorse. Anche gli inchiostri e le tinture utilizzati sono biodegradabili, il che rappresenta un passo positivo verso una maggiore sostenibilità.

Conclusioni:
In definitiva, il Telecomando wireless AmazonBasics è un accessorio pratico e conveniente per chiunque desideri catturare scatti a distanza senza dover correre avanti e indietro tra la fotocamera e il soggetto. La sua semplice operatività e il suo design sottile lo rendono un'aggiunta utile al kit di qualsiasi fotografo. Tuttavia, tieni presente la compatibilità limitata con alcuni modelli di fotocamere Canon. Se la tua fotocamera è supportata, questo telecomando può sicuramente semplificare il processo di cattura delle immagini senza dover fare compromessi sulla nitidezza e la qualità.; En esta cámara solo se puede usar para grabar vídeo, porque para hacer fotos, ya tiene el disparo retardado.; Ho recentemente acquistato il telecomando wireless per la mia fotocamera Canon e devo dire che è stata una delle migliori decisioni che ho preso per migliorare la mia esperienza fotografica. Questo piccolo dispositivo ha veramente rivoluzionato il modo in cui catturo le immagini.

Iniziamo con la facilità d'uso. La configurazione è stata semplicissima: ho sincronizzato il telecomando con la mia fotocamera Canon in pochi secondi e sono stato pronto a scattare. La comodità di poter scattare foto o avviare la registrazione video da una certa distanza è semplicemente fantastica, specialmente quando si tratta di fotografare soggetti in movimento o catturare scatti notturni senza rischio di mosso.

La portata del telecomando è sorprendente. Ho potuto utilizzarlo con successo anche a distanze considerevoli dalla mia fotocamera, il che mi ha permesso di sperimentare angoli di ripresa unici e catturare momenti spontanei senza dovermi preoccupare di rimanere vicino al dispositivo.

Un altro aspetto che mi ha colpito è la sua versatilità. Oltre alla funzione di scatto remoto, il telecomando offre anche la possibilità di impostare un ritardo prima dello scatto, ideale per scattare selfie o per evitare vibrazioni indesiderate sulla fotocamera durante la cattura di lunghe esposizioni.

La compatibilità con una vasta gamma di modelli Canon è un altro punto a favore di questo telecomando. Non importa se hai una fotocamera reflex digitale o una mirrorless Canon, c'è una buona probabilità che questo telecomando funzioni con il tuo dispositivo.

Infine, devo menzionare la qualità costruttiva del telecomando. È robusto, leggero e si adatta comodamente al palmo della mano, garantendo una presa sicura durante l'uso.

In conclusione, se sei un fotografo amatoriale o professionista che desidera migliorare la propria esperienza di scatto, il telecomando wireless per Canon è un accessorio indispensabile. Con la sua facilità d'uso, la portata eccezionale e la versatilità, ti permetterà di liberare la tua creatività e catturare immagini spettacolari con facilità. Consiglio vivamente questo prodotto a tutti gli appassionati di fotografia che vogliono portare le proprie capacità al livello successivo.; Parfait pour mon canon Eos 650D 😁; Habe eine Canon Eos 600d und dieser Fernauslöser funktioniert super dafür und ist sehr klein und unauffällig.

Con las otras marcas me hacen sentir como un operador más que la cámara va a hacer gran parte del trabajo y te desconecta con el criterio, esto es una opinión personal y el motivo o por el cual me quedo con Fuji

En relación a modelos anteriores de la misma marca esta vez se siente más integrado el tracking de objetos es mucho más dinámico y el sonido al tomar una foto se hizo mucho más discreto se siente una cámara duradera

I decided to take the plunge and move systems after a long consideration. This camera is a compact setup. I like that and it doesn’t compromise in picture quality. In fact it is easy to carry around this camera with a prime lens and whip out and take pictures anywhere anytime. Autofocus is fast. Only downside I feel is that there aren’t enough touch functionalities (e.g. navigating the menu using touch). Picture qualities are amazing. Low light performance is also wonderful. Had never managed to take such crisp photos at high iso in the Nikon world. The camera is also very quiet. There are plenty of YouTube videos discussing pros and cons. Do look through if you are considering buying. One thing I realised is that this model does sacrifice certain features in order to keep it compact form factor (e.g. MP or video capture features). If you prefer feature rich camera and form factor is secondary, then this is not the camera for you. But if you are a serious amateur, and would rather have a powerful camera for the travel or walk about , then this is a wonderful pick.; ; ; I was using RX100M6 and after seeing this, I decided to buy this one and I am very happy about it.
Things I like about it:
- Compact and easy to carry around
- Articulating screen
- Excellent image quality
- Very good Battery life
- Easy FTP file transfer
- Battery / SD Card / USD slots placement on the side
- and more..

If you are considering to buy it, go ahead, you will like it.; Bad quality images and it has focus issues. Produces poor resolution images and its not usable camera. I would not recommend for usage; Paired it with Sigma 24-70mm and what a combo it is. Fast, Sharp and nice bokeh.; ..and see professional output comes from this thing. Works with my sigma 1.4 lenses (crop lens) of the old a6000 (more than enough quality output for me!); Very satisfied with the photo and video quality. Great purchase."

I am very satisfied with the results. We just attach one on either side of the phone camera and we are good to go!
One feature to know is- that the brightness is adjustable. Long press the button to adjust the brightness. Would highly recommend it.; Easy to use and handy. Must buy it; This one is good, just it cam with poor usb c jack, feels like it should come off easily,
a tripod needs to be added in same price at least; Best in class unbelievably for this price classy look with all features.🎇🎇🎊🎊👌👌; It's too good, you can use for shoot nd all; I used it to make 1 video then in the middle of the shoot it's battery was dead. I charged it's battery. Then even after 24hrs charge it was not working. I thought maybe the charger is defected. I tried with another one. After trying it for more than months. I came to the conclusion that this is defected. Neither does it charges nor it works.; Mi sono stupito del fatto che i supporti presenti in confezione con la GoPro non fossero compatibili con gli attacchi a vite standard per apparecchi fotografici.
Problema risolto prontamente con questo set, due attacchi di cui uno per la slitta rapida della GoPro è uno per l’attacco a pettine, risparmiando spazio dove necessario.
Prodotto ben realizzato, buoni materiali, solido e fa bene quello per cui è realizzato.; Rien à redire, ces adaptateurs pour GoPro font leur taf, juste peut-être un prix un peu élevé pour de simples morceaux de plastique, mais le contrat est rempli.; Definately sturdy enough, and easy to fit my Go pro to the standard mount for the tripod I already had. So excellent value for money, doubley so as I don't need to buy a new tripod.; lo he comprado para una gopro hero 7 black, y queda perfecto, el material es muy robusto, no parece plástico de baratija, todo lo contrario es bastante grueso y tiene pinta que aguantará bastante lo que le eches.

Lo uso para colocar la gopro en un gorillapod y ningún problema, encaja todo perfectamente, resiste los movimientos que le des y como he dicho antes, no da sensación de que sea material débil o que se vaya a romper.

Lo mejor es el precio, que he visto en tiendas físicas adaptadores parecidos que se van a veinte euros, solo por ser para gopro... este no tiene nada que envidiar, cumple su función y tiene un precio razonable tratándose realmente de un trozo de plástico.

100% recomendable, es el mejor adaptador en relación calidad precio.; Si eres aficionado al video y tienes la fortuna de tener una o varias Gopro yo creo que estos accesorios son vitales ya que te permiten utilizar cualquier accesorio para cámara normal o DSLR, poder utilizarla con un tripie genérico puede ser la diferencia entre cargar mucho equipo a una sesión o llevar y comprar algo especifico para cada cámara.

Los materiales son de plástico ambos pero se nota que su construcción esta bien hecha y que aguantan un uso más rudo de lo habitual, ademas de que es ligero.

En general no hay mucho que decir además de que si vale la pena aún cuando sea para estar prevenido en caso de tener que usar diferentes monturas o poder adaptarlo a equipo de fotografía mas especializado."

Love the retro design that reminds me of the good old days. Brings back great memories. Beautiful camera with all the new technology. Perfect.; Amazon entregó en el tiempo prometido.
Sobre esta lente, las imágenes y los videos que toma con la cámara Z5 son de gran calidad. En realidad no se distorsiona en los extremos no obstante ser gran angular, razón por la que utilizaba el 40 mm f2. No está estabilizado y no tiene ningún switch. Se debe usar en cámaras con estabilizador integrado. Lo recomiendo ampliamente.; it came with no warranty or manual, the box is obviously opened before. Returned without trying the camera.; Because I have arthritis, I wanted a camera that was lighter weight than my old Nikon D7100, and when I saw that this camera had the old-style knobs on top, I jumped at the chance to buy it. I love the easy access to the settings, which I can adjust by feel while keeping my eye on the viewfinder and my subject. I just came back from 7 days in Morro Bay, CA to photography the local wildlife and this camera handled it all very well. It does have a bit of a problem focusing at night, but don't they all? I am most accustomed to using the viewfinder, rather than the large display, so I ended up turning off the display because my nose kept hitting it and activating the touch controls, screwing up my shot. However, it's super easy to switch it back on when needed. I shot under sunny skies and cloudy, rainy days. I shot action, closeup, and distance shots of wildlife (see photos). I'm really impressed with this camera and, because it's so lightweight, it's going to be my constant companion from now on.; Nice little camera. Unfortunately it's meant to look like the Nikon FM2. That camera was metal. This one is mostly plastic. Even the 28mm lens mount is plastic. It doesn't have the tactile feel of the FM2 but it's a modern interpretation.

Aside from aesthetics...

Focus point keeps moving. Need to find a way to lock it without switching off the touch screen.

The touch screen works in some modes, like adjusting the focus point but not in the i menu for selecting things.

As usual the Bluetooth is barely usable. I've never found a camera where it works like phones do.

The F mount adapter is too expensive. I'd love to use other Nikon lenses because I'm not buying a bunch of z mount just for this camera.

Top plate, back, bottom plate are (I think, they certainly feel) all plastic. Very light but also feels a little like a toy. The flimsy battery door is no worse than any other mirror less.

I still like the camera. I just wish they'd actually made it really like the FM2 or EL2.

Controls seem ok, not the quality feel of their 80's counterpart but perfectly usable. Not as good as the Z5 either.

One thing this will do that the fm2 couldn't is preview the exposure. I like that about mirrorless.

Focus is fast and accurate but with a small sensor and 28mm lens everything is in focus anyway. The 28 should be f/1.8 or f/2 but with DX it doesn't matter much. The sensor is so good at high iso the only reason for a faster lens is depth of field and that's not happening on 28mm/DX anyway.

Updated after a month. I had it in the box to return but the photos from it are great and it's a pleasure to use. So I kept it. I was originally going to return it and get the Z5, I ended up keeping it especially as the Z5 is only $999 currently.

Compared to the Z5 the z fc lacks heft. For some that might be a positive since it means lighter. For some that's a negative.

I do wish Nikon would standardize their menus. The focus settings in the z fc with the latest firmware are superior to the Z5 (again latest firmware). I wish they were all the same so I could not have to think about the focus modes and their impact while taking photos. If you're a pin spot focus person you won't notice this. If you use eye detect then you will. Not a big deal though and possibly over time the firmware will all synchronize.

One of the best things about Nikon is the nikonpc.com website which let's you download photo styles (picture profiles) and load these into the camera. This means you can get the jpeg ""color science"" however you like it. Of course in raw this has no effect.

I've owned the Df before this, I loved that camera except for the focus speed. This is in the same style but with super up to date technology. If like it if Nikon had made this camera exactly the same except with a ff sensor and with more metal. But that's like saying I want my car to be like the one in the 80s but as safe as today's cars. Back to the z fc. Great camera. You'll take as good photos with this as any Fuji or Canon. If you want full frame for the same cost but with modern styling get the Z5.

Update several months later. I really like this camera. The original concern about it not being hefty and made of metal has left me. I find it a joy to use and am finding myself ignoring other cameras and using the z fc. I use the 28 and 40mm lenses and both are superb. One reason I use this over the other Z or even D series cameras is this has the best face/eye focus tracking of any that I've used (I've not tried the z9). It's faster and better able to find the eye than the others. Even with the latest firmware in each camera.

So glad I didn't return this for what would have been a knee jerk reflex."

The 40.2MP X-Trans CMOS 5 HR sensor is a revelation. Every captured image bursts with detail and clarity, while the X-Processor 5 ensures smooth, responsive operation. It's a photographer's dream, empowering you to freeze fleeting moments with breathtaking fidelity.

Lightweight Powerhouse
Fujifilm somehow managed to pack incredible power into a remarkably compact and lightweight body. My other camera is nikon D850 And if you're carrying that camera with couple of lenses especially while traveling it becomes very hard very soon.

A Photographer's Playground
The tactile dials and buttons are a joy to use, offering intuitive control and instant feedback.
I will not recommend this camera for someone who is trying photography for the first time. But anybody who understands the exposure triangle Can play with it various dials of ISO, Shutter speed and aperture control if you have the right lens.

The Fujifilm X-T5 is more than just a camera; it's a companion on your photographic journey. It's powerful, versatile, and a joy to use.

Con las otras marcas me hacen sentir como un operador más que la cámara va a hacer gran parte del trabajo y te desconecta con el criterio, esto es una opinión personal y el motivo o por el cual me quedo con Fuji

En relación a modelos anteriores de la misma marca esta vez se siente más integrado el tracking de objetos es mucho más dinámico y el sonido al tomar una foto se hizo mucho más discreto se siente una cámara duradera

La recomiendo ampliamente a personas que quieran coleccionar memorias de un viaje personal o a profesionales que se quieran conectar con lo que está pasando en ese momento; La cámara llegó en excelentes condiciones, caja sin daños y bien protegida.; Tengo pocos días con esta cámara y estoy mas que fascinado.

Also, The 1/4'' thread mount shoe makes the light can be mounted on camera, camcoder and tripod stand.; Two Power Supply Methods: the photography light can be powered with attached Type-C cable or NP-F550 battery. Battery life: 120mins (4400mAh, 7.4V), depending on external battery capacity.","This light is pretty bright for its size. I measured 1600 lux at 0.5m and 450 lux at 1m. For an on-camera light, that's pretty decent. I like that it has a big dial for making color adjustments instead of just push buttons like others I've used. For me, it makes making adjustments a bit more intuitive. The included hot shoe adapter is just plastic, but I'm more likely to use the 1/4"" thread in the light itself for mounting it anyway. The build of the light itself is also all plastic, but on the plus side that also makes it very light.

I like that this light can be powered by standard NP-F style batteries rather than relying on a built-in battery. It can be powered via USB-C as well, but it doesn't seem to charge the battery when plugged in. That said, the included battery actually has its own USB-C charging port and charge indicator, so it doesn't need a separate battery charger. When I first got the battery, the onboard charge indicators showed that it was at about 75%. But when I put it in the light and turned it on, the battery indicator on the light only showed it as being half charged. I'm not sure which one was right.

This light gives you several different ways to specify color including RGB, HSL, and by Lee/Rosco color filter number. The onboard menu is limited in the gel codes you can use though. The light effects were kind of mediocre and only moderately convincing to me. I think for for general lighting though, this light does a decent job.; This is, by far, my favorite mini fill light panel. I had a few other mini fill light from Viltrox before and they were too small and not as bright. The Sprite 15C hits that sweet spot of being bright enough to be useful while being light and portable. I wouldn’t say that this is the brightest mini panel light ever but it does keep up with my larger light units fairly well. Here are some LUX readings that I did for the light in different settings. I measured the brightness at the distance of 3 ft away from the center of the light.

Brightness readings:
2800K CCT = 393 LUX
4800K CCT = 385 LUX
6800K CCT = 343 LUX
Pure Red = 184 LUX
Pure Green = 119 LUX
Pure Blue = 59 LUX

As you can see from the readings above, it seems that the best usage of this light is in CCT mode given that it uses the most amount of LED bulbs in the light to achieve the brightness. The nice thing is that the spectrum between warm to cool is fairly even. Though at 2800K, it seems that some of the cool LED bulbs are still on. Not a big deal given that my other panel seem to have a drop in brightness at the warmest spectrum.

The RGB brightness feels pretty dim compared to the CCT mode but not a total deal breaker. When I use the light in RGB or color phase mode, I tend to not need it to be super bright since they tend to play a role as an accent rather than trying to fill the scene.

The weight of this is surprisingly light given the size and the attached battery.. It is an acceptable weight for me to have it attached on to my camera. Alternatively, the weight could be reduced if I were to get a dummy battery and have it be plugged in instead of using the actual battery itself.

Overall, I’m very happy with this light unit. This will be a very nice addition to my travel kit so that I will always have a way to brighten up the scene in a pinch. Highly recommended.; This battery-powered RGB video light is useful for mood-lighting backgrounds and products. Changing the HSL and color temperature can be a bit challenging due to the button layout but I much prefer the rotary dial to normal buttons. The light effects are mostly for fun. My favorite feature is that it uses Sony NP-F type batteries which also work on my video monitor. It's fully plastic construction and lightweight but cheapy feeling. The battery charges using USB-C. The included hot shoe mount can pan and tilt but is made of light plastic. I like this system and will use it mainly for travel.; First the good:
The use of Sony NP-F mount batteries makes it easy to fit this into most run & gun workflows.
The included battery has a type-c port to recharge.
The included battery is white, making it easy to quickly spot which battery in my pile can be recharged with a type-c cable.
The color and white balance controls are fairly intuitive.

The less-than-good:
Lots of plastic used, which makes it feel cheap and less durable, although it does make it light enough to easily run around with all day.
The diffusion panel at the front of the light isn't great, and has noticable bright spots instead of the even lighting you'd ideally want.
It's a 15W light, but by default it tells you that it only outputs 10W, and after looking through the directions 3 times, I still don't see directions for a higher output mode. There IS an app, but I would hope that wouldn't be an app exclusive feature.; This design is rapidly climbing my list of must-have items for smaller environments and shoots! It is easy to configure, and the phone app makes the operation even easier! I like the dual-power features, and I really like the rechargeable battery pack. It charges with a typical c-cable, and it has a button that displays how much charge is remaining. It isn't very heavy and the entire set-up can be mounted on a camera cage if necessary. I do like the FX lighting, but I'm most satisfied with the Light Temp and RGB settings. This design addresses all of my needs, and I can easily encourage others to adopt this particular lamp as first-time purchase. Viltrox is really stepping up their game with this model."

Canon Eos R6 Mark II (Photography camera)

I am feeling very happy because this masterpiece has arrived into market. Not only me but also so many photo or selfie lovers they will feel happy for this product.

Features:

First of all coming to sensor and processor it is a 24.2 MP full-framer and it is coming with CMOS sensor and DICIC X processor. The Auto Focus System

in the camera helps us to capture advanced subject detections including humans, animals and vehicles. The major feature included in this camera is you can click your photos up to 40 fps with electronic sutter and 12 fps with mechanical shutter. Coming to video recording the picture is 4K video at up to 60p, oversampled from 6K ProRes RAW external recording. Slow motion of 1080p video at up to 180 fps is also available in this camera.It is fully articulated 3-inchtouchscreen LCD with 1.62 million dots. Photo/video switch for quick transitions. The LP-E6NH battery offers significantly improved battery life, with up to 450 shots using the viewfinder and 760 shots using the LCD. The camera is compatible with the BG-R10 battery grip for extended shooting time. The camera includes features to reduce focus breathing and rolling shutter, enhancing the quality of video recordings.It is a dual SD UHS-II card slots.

Advantages:

It has superior autofocus and it supports rapid continuous shooting suitable for action photography. It has high quality 4K and 6K video options with improved heat management and no recording time limits. It has significant improvement in battery performance compared to its predecessor (Canon Eos R6 Mark I). While the dynamic range in CLog3 mode is not as extensive as some competitors, it still offers good performance for regular video and photo shooting. It includes a microphone port, headphone jack, remote control port, USB-C, and mini HDMI. The camera can be used as a 4K webcam via USB-C, enhancing its versatility for live streaming and video calls.

Disadvantages:

One of the major disadvantages of this product is its price. Hoiher price may be prohibitive for some user also it lacks the faster CFExpress card standard which would benefit high-speed data handling.It has some occasional issues with animal autofocus accuracy in low-contrast situations.It buttons maay lack the tactile response preffered by some photographers. The R6 Mark II lacks easy-to-edit intra-frame codecs like All-l or ProRes for internal recording, which can complicate the post-production workflow. The camera uses a mini HDMI port instead of a full-size HDMI. Mini HDMI ports are more prone to damage and are less robust compared to full-size HDMI ports, which can be an inconvenience for professionals who frequently use external monitors or recorders. While Canon's RF lens lineup is growing, it is still relatively limited compared to the extensive selection of EF lenses.

Money Worthable or not:

Yes,the Canon Eos R6 Mark II is wothable the investment for photographers seeking a versatile high- performance camera with advanced features. No such camera come with this fearutres in that price.In My opion we can shoot a short film with high quality video with it. For short films directors or some one they do reels in online platforms for them it is totally worthable that much money to spent on it.

Rating out of 5:

So it will give it 4.5 out of 5 because RF lenses are larger and heavier compared to their EF counterparts and when compared to the EF mount, the RF mount has fewer third-party lens options. This limits the choices available to users looking for more affordable or specialized lenses from manufacturers like Sigma or Tamron."

I am very satisfied with the results. We just attach one on either side of the phone camera and we are good to go!
One feature to know is- that the brightness is adjustable. Long press the button to adjust the brightness. Would highly recommend it.; Easy to use and handy. Must buy it; This one is good, just it cam with poor usb c jack, feels like it should come off easily,
a tripod needs to be added in same price at least; Best in class unbelievably for this price classy look with all features.🎇🎇🎊🎊👌👌; It's too good, you can use for shoot nd all; I used it to make 1 video then in the middle of the shoot it's battery was dead. I charged it's battery. Then even after 24hrs charge it was not working. I thought maybe the charger is defected. I tried with another one. After trying it for more than months. I came to the conclusion that this is defected. Neither does it charges nor it works.; Mi sono stupito del fatto che i supporti presenti in confezione con la GoPro non fossero compatibili con gli attacchi a vite standard per apparecchi fotografici.
Problema risolto prontamente con questo set, due attacchi di cui uno per la slitta rapida della GoPro è uno per l’attacco a pettine, risparmiando spazio dove necessario.
Prodotto ben realizzato, buoni materiali, solido e fa bene quello per cui è realizzato.; Rien à redire, ces adaptateurs pour GoPro font leur taf, juste peut-être un prix un peu élevé pour de simples morceaux de plastique, mais le contrat est rempli.; Definately sturdy enough, and easy to fit my Go pro to the standard mount for the tripod I already had. So excellent value for money, doubley so as I don't need to buy a new tripod.; lo he comprado para una gopro hero 7 black, y queda perfecto, el material es muy robusto, no parece plástico de baratija, todo lo contrario es bastante grueso y tiene pinta que aguantará bastante lo que le eches.

Lo uso para colocar la gopro en un gorillapod y ningún problema, encaja todo perfectamente, resiste los movimientos que le des y como he dicho antes, no da sensación de que sea material débil o que se vaya a romper.

Lo mejor es el precio, que he visto en tiendas físicas adaptadores parecidos que se van a veinte euros, solo por ser para gopro... este no tiene nada que envidiar, cumple su función y tiene un precio razonable tratándose realmente de un trozo de plástico.

100% recomendable, es el mejor adaptador en relación calidad precio.; Si eres aficionado al video y tienes la fortuna de tener una o varias Gopro yo creo que estos accesorios son vitales ya que te permiten utilizar cualquier accesorio para cámara normal o DSLR, poder utilizarla con un tripie genérico puede ser la diferencia entre cargar mucho equipo a una sesión o llevar y comprar algo especifico para cada cámara.

Los materiales son de plástico ambos pero se nota que su construcción esta bien hecha y que aguantan un uso más rudo de lo habitual, ademas de que es ligero.

En general no hay mucho que decir además de que si vale la pena aún cuando sea para estar prevenido en caso de tener que usar diferentes monturas o poder adaptarlo a equipo de fotografía mas especializado."

Image quality is much better in low light, and the 40MP sensor gives way more options in post than the G9 20MP sensor. The auto-focus is much better than the G9 for everything except macro, where the X-H2 seems to focus just a little bit short -- e.g. on the nearest leg of an insect, rather than they eye or thorax -- even when using the ""insect detect"" feature added in firmware 3.0.

I'm not getting nearly the promised battery-life -- maybe ""battery life"" didn't factor in the AF power draw? -- so I'll have to buy spares to do a full day's shooting.

Be warned that Fuji RAW files are a challenge for some RAW processing programs -- Affinity Photo and Lightroom both produced desaturated and low-detail images from it -- so you should definitely use the freeware version of Capture One provided from Fuji. Its processing demands will strain ordinary laptop CPUs and older desktop CPUs too, and you will have to choose whether to put C1 on your laptop or desktop since the freeware version of C1 allows only one installation.

However, the SOOC Fuji jpegs are almost as good at dynamic range as what I can get from editing any half-way-decently-exposed RAW files, so I have fewer photos that I have to run through a full RAW processing regimen than I did with the G9.; Coming from the Fujifilm X-T3 , this camera feels more robust and easier to handle because of the large grip. I absolutely love shooting with it and I take it everywhere. With that being said, the looks and feel shouldn’t justify your purchase decision alone. I don’t shoot videos at all so I didn’t opt for the S version but this camera is certainly capable. The battery life is great compared to the XT3 and I love the always on display. The view finder is bright and crisp. The auto focus is very nice as well. With the 40 megapixels, I notice the difference when I crop images and zooming in to see the clarity and sharpness. I won’t be an amateur much longer. I feel like I have arrived when I shoot with this lol. No seriously, great camera. If you want to upgrade or just try it out you should. The price may be steep so your current camera may get the job done just fine.; Lots to like. Even has GPS that I didn’t knew it had. Coming from full frame Canon DSLR’s. Got the Fringer adapter for all my Canon lenses and they work well with it. The Jpegs coming right out of the camera are extremely nice with lots of film simulations to choose from. It may change how you think about raws on this camera. I would more heavily edit the raws on my Canon’s to get what I like, not so much on the XH2. Jpegs edit well but not really needed imagine that. Low light high iso is just ok, not quite like my full frames. The resolution is fantastic but the file sizes are large and will become an issue. More storage solutions coming my way. Kit lens is good but not stellar for this high resolution camera. Everything you would expect from a flag ship camera.; Never thought I would say this but the best multiuser camera I ever had the pictures are amazing the videos are extraordinary and even a novice can hold the camera steady and shaking is non existent the lens is heavy but perfect fit overall the best ever and I had and have many cameras; I've been shooting pictures and a little video since the film days. I've mainly used DSLR's and had some reservations switching to mirrorless cameras. This camera has put all my reservations to rest. The viewfinder provides an electronic view better than the best digital SLR cameras because of its electronically controlled brightness that shows what your actual picture will look like, or you can have it show the natural view like DSLR. The difference is that at 120 MHz, the view is just as good as a pentaprism used in a DSLR.
Secondly, it is somewhat lighter than an equivalent full frame camera since its APSC, but the pictures look just as good with the advances in sensor technology.
Fujifilm's latest lenses developed for the 40 MP sensor are fast and sharp edge to edge and priced less than equivalent full frame lenses.
I am in love with this system and this camera in particular, and the viewfinder was what finally sealed the deal for me."

Mistakenly negative feedback was put forward to the seller. I'm sorry for the inconvenience caused to you.; Solid construction makes this a very good option if you want to adapt any Minolta MD or MC lenses to your Fuji X-mount camera.; This is totally manual adapter, so no autofocus and no F number setting via camera.
It means it will just attach on your camera and camera won’t focus or set any aperture.

Now real part : if you have canon STM lens, then this adapter is useless as STM lens required electronic contact even for manual focus! So check if your lens has manual focus ring and manual focus works without attaching to camera.
STM lens or Fuji lens has electronic manual focus motor so u cannot focus these lens on this type of adapter at all!
I am using this for mounting canon 10-18 on Fuji XT3 as ultra wide angle don’t require sharp focusing; Does what it says it does, a pretty good manual adapter for its price.; As expected; Fully manual Fuji fitting adapter for Canon EOS lenses. Lenses will be manual with aperture wide open.

Great quality ""dummy"" adapter. Not sure why some people expected there will be communication between the lens and the camera, when clearly there is no electronic parts in this adapter, price confirms that too ;) These adapters are so you can use your Canon EF lenses on your Fujifilm camera. If you happen to have Rokinon 85mm f/1.4 and Rokinon 14mm f/2.8 EF mount, all manual lenses, you will get aperture ring on them too. All manual, especially for video, that's how we like it :); Es un adaptador para salir del paso y poder usar tus lentes Canon en la Cámara Fuji.
Pero mucho ojo: si tu lente no tiene control de apertura mecánico, vas a disparar por default en la apertura mas grande sin poderlo cambiar.

El enfoque lo tienes que hacer manual aunque tu lente Canon sea Autofocus.
Es una opción barata para salir del paso. No creo que pueda ser un accesorio de batalla. Si eres bodero ni lo sueñes.

Está construido muy sólidamente, se siente rígido y pesado, sin juego y sin partes de plástico.

Es para situaciones mas controladas, con tripié, como de estudio.

The 5K resolution it offers at such an affordable price is simply remarkable. I never thought I could get such excellent video quality without breaking the bank.

The camera's performance has been outstanding, and I'm thrilled with the level of detail it captures in both photos and videos. The 50 MP camera produces stunning images that are vibrant and rich in colors.the stability feature is a game-changer, providing smooth and steady footage even during action-packed moments. I love how it enhances the overall quality of my videos.The 170-degree wide-angle lens is perfect for capturing expansive scenes, making my shots look even more cinematic and immersive.In all honesty, the IZI Click action camera has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. It's a fantastic tool for vlogging, capturing memories, and creating engaging content for my audience.

If you're in the market for an affordable yet high-quality action camera, I highly recommend giving the IZI Click a try. It's an incredible value for money, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase!; This is a very basic camera, very poor video quality also video flickering issue while recording,neither does it have any much function nor is the video quality so good, it would be better to visit a shop and buy it instead of buying it online. So that you can avoid wasting your money like me, Amazon has a return policy only if it is defective and not a refund.; Bought this on Summer sale for INR 8,499. This action camera is really amazing and I must say it has exceeded my expectations. The 5K resolution provides crystal-clear video quality, and the 48 MP camera delivers stunning photos. Stabilization not upto the mark, but ok. Data transfer is fast. Considering the price, this action camera offers exceptional value for money. Overall, I highly recommend the IZI One PLus; You just need a high processing memory card otherwise 60FPS will not work
Video quality is very nice
Sound quality is okay but it cannot reduce noise
Battery is also good
Value for money; Showing IZI new One+ in product description but have received IZI one normal one which is available at Amazon in rs. 1000/- less price. In description mentioned 20+ accessories but recieved only 17 including camera. Totally making fool. Totally disappointed with the purchase. However camera quality is average in this price range. Will update regarding performance later.; Whether you're scaling mountains or exploring underwater caves, the IZI New ONE+ Action Camera is your ultimate adventure companion. Its compact size makes it easy to take anywhere, while its impressive features ensure you never miss a moment. With 5K resolution, 6-axis gyro stabilization, and waterproofing up to 110ft, it's ready for any challenge. The dual screens, included external mic, and long-lasting battery life make capturing and sharing your adventures a breeze. Say hello to your new favorite travel buddy!; I’ve bought this camera since day one ☝️ I had battery heating issue I spoke to customer care Izi one plus to Ifran he suggested me to try for few days and get back to us meanwhile my amazon return policy expired now as I am trying to communicate with customer care they are least bothered to respond I have all the conversations and voice recordings …it’s the cheapest action camera I have ever seen; Ordered this product after watching many many videos on youtube.....but sadly each video turned out to be fake and misleading. The camera is not gud at all. Only good thing about this camera is accessories that we get with it, else everything is pooor. The main thing for which one buys an action camera is stabilization, which is worst in this camera.....dynamic range sucks ......a one minute video in 4k 60 fps takes 1 gb of storage which is too much as compared to the quality it delivers. I mean1 gb space for a video of 1 minute that too in poorest quality is way too much. Highly highly disappointed by this product. 5 hazaar or add karke DJI action 2 lena sahi hai. Iska wide angle ekdum bekaaar ....kora bakwaaas wide angle. Video clarity ghatiyaaa.....self vlogging jisme aap khud ko jada dikhate ho uske liye ye cam thoda theek hai....baaki motovlog, carvlog, action vlog ke liye isse bekaar koi product nahi ho sakta ....do not waste ur money. Feeling bad to write such review for an Indian Product....but truth is truth. Kisi ke jhaanse me mat aao dosto or mujhpe trust karo , thoda or paisa ikatha karo or acha action cam lo bas."

Mistakenly negative feedback was put forward to the seller. I'm sorry for the inconvenience caused to you.; Solid construction makes this a very good option if you want to adapt any Minolta MD or MC lenses to your Fuji X-mount camera.; This is totally manual adapter, so no autofocus and no F number setting via camera.
It means it will just attach on your camera and camera won’t focus or set any aperture.

Now real part : if you have canon STM lens, then this adapter is useless as STM lens required electronic contact even for manual focus! So check if your lens has manual focus ring and manual focus works without attaching to camera.
STM lens or Fuji lens has electronic manual focus motor so u cannot focus these lens on this type of adapter at all!
I am using this for mounting canon 10-18 on Fuji XT3 as ultra wide angle don’t require sharp focusing; Does what it says it does, a pretty good manual adapter for its price.; As expected; Fully manual Fuji fitting adapter for Canon EOS lenses. Lenses will be manual with aperture wide open. Quality of adapter is excellent.; Perfect fitting adapter for C mount to fujifilm camera mount; Not working adapter Fujifilm XT200 camera with video shoot and pictures cupture so please don't buy thish only show view; Fits perfectly, there is none play whatsoever... on neither side. Great quality ""dummy"" adapter. Not sure why some people expected there will be communication between the lens and the camera, when clearly there is no electronic parts in this adapter, price confirms that too ;) These adapters are so you can use your Canon EF lenses on your Fujifilm camera. If you happen to have Rokinon 85mm f/1.4 and Rokinon 14mm f/2.8 EF mount, all manual lenses, you will get aperture ring on them too. All manual, especially for video, that's how we like it :); Es un adaptador para salir del paso y poder usar tus lentes Canon en la Cámara Fuji.
Pero mucho ojo: si tu lente no tiene control de apertura mecánico, vas a disparar por default en la apertura mas grande sin poderlo cambiar.

El enfoque lo tienes que hacer manual aunque tu lente Canon sea Autofocus.
Es una opción barata para salir del paso. No creo que pueda ser un accesorio de batalla. Si eres bodero ni lo sueñes.

Está construido muy sólidamente, se siente rígido y pesado, sin juego y sin partes de plástico.

Es para situaciones mas controladas, con tripié, como de estudio.
El servicio y entrega de Amazon México SORPRENDENTE, me lo entregaron 4 días antes de lo esperado, con todo y que es artículo de importación.; Excelente material, si quieres un producto para poder usar tus viejos lentes, éste es el indicado, además, de ser económico; works as expected, a little tight maybe.; Excellent adapter.

Hoping my nephew will have a cord as I really like the look and feel of the camera itself.
UPDATE: had to return the camera because of the cord not fitting. Also I didn’t see an SD card but when I looked at the camera closer it was already in the camera and when I tried to take a picture it said no card.

Exposure and focus has to be adjusted manually; Designed for Fujifilm FX Mount X-Pro1 X-E1 X-A1 X-M1 Cameras and new models; Brand Name: Fotasy","The product works fine for me. Mistakenly negative feedback was put forward to the seller. I'm sorry for the inconvenience caused to you.; Solid construction makes this a very good option if you want to adapt any Minolta MD or MC lenses to your Fuji X-mount camera.; This is totally manual adapter, so no autofocus and no F number setting via camera.
It means it will just attach on your camera and camera won’t focus or set any aperture.

Now real part : if you have canon STM lens, then this adapter is useless as STM lens required electronic contact even for manual focus! So check if your lens has manual focus ring and manual focus works without attaching to camera.
STM lens or Fuji lens has electronic manual focus motor so u cannot focus these lens on this type of adapter at all!
I am using this for mounting canon 10-18 on Fuji XT3 as ultra wide angle don’t require sharp focusing; Does what it says it does, a pretty good manual adapter for its price.; As expected; Fully manual Fuji fitting adapter for Canon EOS lenses. Lenses will be manual with aperture wide open. Quality of adapter is excellent.; Perfect fitting adapter for C mount to fujifilm camera mount; Not working adapter Fujifilm XT200 camera with video shoot and pictures cupture so please don't buy thish only show view; Fits perfectly, there is none play whatsoever... on neither side. Great quality ""dummy"" adapter. Not sure why some people expected there will be communication between the lens and the camera, when clearly there is no electronic parts in this adapter, price confirms that too ;) These adapters are so you can use your Canon EF lenses on your Fujifilm camera. If you happen to have Rokinon 85mm f/1.4 and Rokinon 14mm f/2.8 EF mount, all manual lenses, you will get aperture ring on them too. All manual, especially for video, that's how we like it :); Es un adaptador para salir del paso y poder usar tus lentes Canon en la Cámara Fuji.
Pero mucho ojo: si tu lente no tiene control de apertura mecánico, vas a disparar por default en la apertura mas grande sin poderlo cambiar.

El enfoque lo tienes que hacer manual aunque tu lente Canon sea Autofocus.
Es una opción barata para salir del paso. No creo que pueda ser un accesorio de batalla. Si eres bodero ni lo sueñes.

Está construido muy sólidamente, se siente rígido y pesado, sin juego y sin partes de plástico.

Es para situaciones mas controladas, con tripié, como de estudio.
El servicio y entrega de Amazon México SORPRENDENTE, me lo entregaron 4 días antes de lo esperado, con todo y que es artículo de importación.; Excelente material, si quieres un producto para poder usar tus viejos lentes, éste es el indicado, además, de ser económico; works as expected, a little tight maybe.; Excellent adapter. Now i can use my old nikon lenses on fuji."

The cord won’t fit into the double battery charger. Also I didn’t realize a wall adapter wasn’t included in the description and I don’t have one. Hoping my nephew will have a cord as I really like the look and feel of the camera itself.
UPDATE: had to return the camera because of the cord not fitting. Also I didn’t see an SD card but when I looked at the camera closer it was already in the camera and when I tried to take a picture it said no card. I don’t know if I received a used camera or what so sent it back. I loved the look and feel of the camera but I’m afraid to order another one."

Ample height and easy to setup. Quite portable in nature as in comes in 2 portions. Great buy although the price could be a bit cheaper especially when there are competitors with a little inferior quality going for as low as 400-500.; The tripod has disappointed me big time. The weight of the base of tripod is very little and the top becomes heavy when you place your cam or phone because of which it topples. The balance is not good.

The holder and light are very loose, it keeps drooping when taking a video.

Neither the base, not the holder is sturdy. I regret buying this product. The item is not recommended.; Great product with that price range , quality is also good to hold small cameras and phone. Not able for heavy equipments, as it said this is purely for phone and light items so I am fully satisfied with the product, surely you can purchase.; I liked the size adjustment and portability of this selfie stand. It's very much light weight, which makes it handy. The light is good with 3 modes. Only problem is the mobile place holder. The phone doesn't stay at one place and it keeps rotating.

Sturdy, adjustable, and easy to use, it provides bright and even lighting for stunning photos and videos.
