Overall good product bought at Rs 999; I have brought just one month back but Mike is not working of left earbuds and tried to called to customer care but they kept on hold for 15 mins and then cut the call, no response and no call back.

Although they took all details first and later kept on hold to check the internal issue, told me that technical team will connect and resolve my issue but later disconnected.; Pros:
Fpods are extremely good for this price(‚Çπ999) and feature like volume control sensor in the airpods itself.

Call clarity is clear and it fits in ears nicely.

The most brilliant feature is the battery. I've bought it at least a week back and have been using it very frequently and watched at least 2 movies and the battery just reduced to 70%

Haven't had these qualities with the product that costs around 2.5k

Cons:
I feel the sound quality is bit low comparatively. Few vidoes/audios require more volume than usual to hear it normally.

Sometimes the Bluetooth is getting interrupted for no reason even if the device is within range.

Besides these cons, this product is absolutely a great economical 'good to go' one for sure.

P.S. May have to review the above post a long term usageüòÅ; This earbud üéß is very nice üëç
Sound quality 100% clean ü´ß And Very Nice üëç
If I want to decrease volume I was touching too many times on Left side Earbud üëÇ üéß
If I want to increase Volume then I was touching too many times on Right side Earbud üëÇ üéß

Battery backup is 50 hrs very Good üëç.

I am giving you 5 Out of 5 Star‚≠ê rating; Bass not that much Good But Performance wise it's better compare to Other Pods....

FZ100 ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖüíØüíØüíØ; Product seems good. Paired with my ipad and iPhone nicely. Decent sound quality with deep bass but i must say it is not suitable for gaming at all!!!... Too much latency.; According to me, these are the best ear buds in friendly budget, brand and appearance.
It has best fit,
Best ENC,
Best Sound Quality,
Good Touch Control,
Excellent Mic Quality,
Good Appearance like sports version,
FPods are best!üòç; Good quality sound at this price point
A good ear comfort as well."

It offers a good backup battery. It sounds fantastic as well. Adaptable to fit different head sizes. The product is hybrid. Both wired and wireless connections are supported. If your battery runs out, you can use the wire to keep using it.
There is only one issue that I have observed, and that is sweating during the summer.; I have got the black color for me. Battery backup is too good and you can use with aux cable to reserve battery. Sound quality is okay but in higher volume, sound leaks and anyone near you can hear clearly. Noise cancellation is almost none, and call quality is ok(dual pairing is available so if you receive a call on phone and on your pc some video was playing it will get paused automatically , but the problem is call quality gets seriously degraded if you turn on the video - call will get garbled and you wouldn't be able to understand a single word of the person you are talking to. ear sponge quality is ok , you get one on head , and get ready to have sweaty ears in long session. Sponge can be connected again using thin spoon if they get open from the ear cup. Random disconnection is here and there and there is some minor delay - mind it if you are planning to use as gaming headphone , singleplayer is ok but not for multiplayer. biggest drawback is there is no system to fold the earcups. overall good budget headphone.; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition. Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad. It is not good for gaming. For gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.
Thank you for reading just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.; Sound quality and battery is very good.
Price is aslo good, but product is not durable for long time... Maybe product will not work after 12 month.; Sound great,price affordable,mic quality ok hai, connectivity quickly response karta hai, plastick body hai ok hai , comfortable hai per halka sweat aata hai near ear; I bought this product about 2.5 months back, My purpose of buying this headphone is to watch lectures, binge watching of movies I was wondering for budget friendly headphone under rupees 1,000.

So, After using this product for about 2.5 months and still using it. I would like to share the likes and dislikes of this product based on my usage.

Likes :
1) Sound quality is good and crisp great for listening lectures and watching movies and other content.
2) Battery life is also good it gives output of about 15 hours my daily usage is about 4-5 hours.
3) Bluetooth range is quite good for this budget.

Dislikes :
1) It's leather quality is very bad not satisfied with its quality to the leather was ripped out within just 2 months.
2) the plastic quality is not so good you can get scratches on its body easily.
3) it consumes more time to get charge it takes around 3-4 hours for 100% charging.
4) the glue used in this headphones cushion are not applied properly it comes out of the body within 1 month only.
5) the noise cancellation is not good you can easily hear outdoor activities sound Even at full volume.

Based on this budget it's a good product from Indian Brands Zebronics but comes with a lot of comprises.

If you really want quality good headphones atleast go for budget higher than rupees 2,500 or select other brands like sony, boat and other brands.; The quality is good and and sound was low because my right side not working and some small defective but product was good üëç; The product is good but they are faking too much by telling there's ENC and Gaming mode while there's no feature like that, it's just a normal Bluetooth headphone. However portability is good, comfort is good durability i would say cheap it can break easily also aux cable is not durable, sound quality good for this price range."

They offer all the important features like Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), spatial audio, and good battery life. The app support is excellent, and the build quality is very good.

The ANC is awesome, and the sound quality is impressive. For gaming, it provides low latency modes, which is great. The sound quality is great with various modes to choose from. You can clearly separate out all the vocals and instruments, and the bass does not overpower anything. Overall, these earphones provide great value for the price and have been a fantastic choice for me.; After six months with the Realme Buds Wireless 3, they prove to be a budget-friendly choice with decent performance. The sound quality is good for its price range, offering clear highs and balanced mids. The battery life is impressive, lasting up to 20 hours on a single charge. The lightweight and comfortable design make them suitable for extended use. However, the bass can be underwhelming for bass-heavy genres, and the Bluetooth connection occasionally drops. The in-line controls feel a bit flimsy. Overall, these headphones are a solid choice for casual listeners seeking affordability and comfort.; Ok so this is the review after a day of usage as i will devide this review in parts so I can explain everything...

Battery:- As I said I got this earbuds yesterday and battery percentage was 80% I didn't charge it and used it around 12 hrs but today its showing 30% I am a Heavy user for earbuds but battery is amazing if you charge it once you can easily use this for 3-4 days I am satisfied

Build:- At first glance it looks shiny plastic build but when you hold it in your hands you will feel the qualty and hardness of the earbuds as well as wires. In 1700 the build is great it's justifies the price the buttons are steady and properly working just one issue that after a long time of use I feel slight pain in my left year but may be it is just me. Also these earbuds are very easy to carry in pockets so don't worry the material is very flexible and strong

ANC:- ANC is pretty descent I never used any earbuds before having any ANC features(previously I used Boat Nirvana ION) it's my first time using it and its good I mean in bus or train it will gonna help me to get rid of unwanted sounds to be honest it cuts 30-40% of outside sounds its descent.

Sound Quality:- Guyz TBH The Sound Quality is amazing let me explain it in detail. So vocals are crystal clear no issue in that. The trebles are amazing. I mean when you listen the songs you will gonna notice all kinds of instruments that are used in the music and also all the small small details you will definitely going to hear those too. I mean the sound seperations are just on point in this price. Let's talk about BASS and if you are a BASS lover just buy it. I am a Basshead I love Extra boosted heavy BASS and these earbuds are made for it. Also you can customise the soundtype in app settings so don't worry... overall its best in sound quality I am in love with this earbuds.

App:- As I mentioned earlier that this earbuds supports realme link app which means there are a lots of customizations which you can do in the app such as there are 4 eq modes
1. Vocals: Basically focuses on movie or videos or if you joined classes using this its good.
2.Original sound: In this mode the music will feel flat with no base but clear audio.
3.pure bass: This is the same as original sound but with bass which I am using it will give clear vocals thumpy bass and amazing trebles.
4. Deep Bass: in this mode the Bass will going to takeover the vocals and trebles and all you can feel is Heavy BASS.

There are more features like You can customize the Bass by activating the Bass function, You can turn on ANC, Transperancy or Off the ANC in the app.

Spatial audio: Sometimes it can create a good 3d surround sounds but not everytime so its just 50-50 like watching movies in this mode will give you a good experience.

Game mode without the game mode you can feel the latency but after turning it on the latency reduces if you are a casual gamer and play games for fun I mean daily 2-3 hrs of gameplay just to enjoy with friends and hangout with them you will going to enjoy it but if you are looking for professional gaming this is not the right one for you.

Extras:- it has bluetooth 5.3 and magnetic off and on feature which I am loving in this as soon as you seprate those earbuds it will get connected instantly that's good I have used Boat nirvana ION and I lost the case and I bought this and one thing I can say that this is far better then those the sound quality build features ANC as well as in everything if you are buying it don't think just trust me you never going to regret.... IT'S THE BEST EARBUDS IN MARKET RIGHT NOW!!!!; I recently bought the Realme Wireless Buds and I'm impressed. The sound quality is excellent, with clear highs and punchy bass. They're very comfortable, and the multiple ear tips helped me get a perfect fit. Battery life is solid, The quick charge feature is handy. Connectivity has been stable and the touch controls are intuitive. Overall, they offer great value for the price and are a fantastic option for budget-friendly wireless earbuds. Highly recommended!; Overall, the product is value for money which comes with the best sound, ANC, Dual device connectivity and built quality, but the earpieces cannot be the most comfortable and can also cause pain for the people with small ears, I checked on internet about this problem and i found that many other customers also feels the same so I will suggest that one should consider about this before buying Realme Buds Wireless 3 in-Ear Bluetooth Headphones,"

Audio quality is good and the mic is very powerful. One of the best Apple products. This model is with USB-C connector and it's a pain if you need to charge your phone while listening, for the rest, it does its job.; The new wired Apple Earbuds are a solid upgrade. They offer great sound quality with clear highs and rich bass. The ergonomic design makes them comfortable to wear for extended periods. The built-in controls and microphone work seamlessly with Apple devices, making it easy to adjust volume, skip music with a double tap , or take calls. The classic wired connection ensures no audio lag and stable performance. However, they might not be ideal for those who prefer the freedom of wireless options. Overall, they're a great choice for Apple fans."

Sound and in cost. Just a bit too tight for head as head hurts if wear them for long. That‚Äôs all; I have been using these headphones from 5 to 6 months and they are pretty much good, they still are as new when I ordered them, These headphones do not have noise cancellation but the sound quality makes these headphones pretty much like noise cancellation, it's features are good and working very well, it's connectivity is also good, but one thing that is not good is it's comfortness it is not comfortable at all, If you wear them for nearly 30-60 mins, your ears will start paining..... It does not have latency in the sound, so it makes these headphones good for gaming, and watching movie.; The body of product is tough and rigid, but sound quality is also good according to price but give some unneccessary cut cut noise in between. The connectivity is very poor, literally took several minutes while connecting to my pc. The comfort is also very bad. Writing this review after using 4-5 months.; Good product at this Price Bracket.
- Sound quality is good but not great. I was using a Boat wired headphone with the same price & the quality of Boat is noticeably better.
- Bass is ok, no jarring and the treble is also not great but good enough.
- Build quality is good, even though it's made out of plastic material.
- I am using this for listening to music mostly and satisfied with the outcome.
- Battery back up is good.
- Bit tight while wearing during the first few days, but will get adjusted in the course of using.
- Overall, a decent product you can go for.
-Last but not the least- Amazon delivery was too prompt and giving all stars for their professional approach.; Nice product I love this and I customise this also very well; it is on ear type of Headphone , so it has less Noise cancellation ...

So It has no any Problem , it is best in price range (My POV).; Couldn't wear it for a long time.
Sound quality and battery life is nice but hurts ear after sometime.; The product is being falsely marketed as ""OVER"" the ear headphones but it's ON_the ear headphone...
This headset is so small that it literally pains the outer ring of your ear üëÇ.
It's definitely not durable, so please use it carefully. Don't use it while sleeping or playing as it can break easily."

Pros
- ANC and ENC at just for price 2k
- Headphones are overear (well depends on your ear size, for me it's over ear)
- bass is fine
- Type - C charging
- Rapid charging, just charge for 10min and use for 2-3 hours
- Dual pairing
- Volume of sound seems fine and enough
- foldable
Cons -
- the ANC is kinda just for name, I can clearly hear fan sound , click ticking and other things , but after playing music of course we can't hear these things well
- plastic build quality but from wht I can see it's a durable and good quality plastic
- Not ""that"" Comfortable, its a bit heavy compared to my old headphones
- your ears will sweat, yep, I feel my ears getting hot

Overall, perfect deal for 2k; The sound quality is worse than a headphone in the same price range which was released 4 years before this one and its too laggy even in high end device.
And there isnt a return policy so am stuck with this which is my bad as i didnt check.; Sound quality is good but can be better especially bass. Build quality can be little better. Call quality is good. Battery backup is excellent. Overall value for money at this price.; This is absolutely value for money product. I like the design and build quality. Sound quality and bass experience is also very impressive in this price range.
ear sponge is very soft and comfortable for long time use.; Build quality is not up to the mark and has doubt on it's durability and flexibility. Sound wise okay but not that good.; Pros :
1) Amazing sound quality but bass response could be better
2) There is voice feedback for every change in game mode or ANC
3) Mic is good
4) Soundstage and sound seperation is good
5) Good build quality as in expensive headphones
6) Great Battery Life

Cons:
1) Don't expect ANC here
2) Not comfortable to wear for long time; If I try to use the headphones with aux cable the sound is very distorted. Left and right sound is breaking. Also it is not comfortable to wear. Earcups are small.; The Built Quality is Good but The sound quality is not great. Good ear pads and battery life"

Sound Quality: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê While not mind-blowing, the sound quality is definitely a notch above what you‚Äôd expect from a budget headset. It won‚Äôt replace your high-end audiophile gear, but for everyday use, it‚Äôs more than satisfactory.

Final Verdict: If you‚Äôre on a tight budget but still want decent build quality and comfort, give the ZEBRONICS Boom Wired Headphone Over-Ear Headset a shot. You might be as pleasantly surprised as I was!; I didn't like the way it was packed. Sloppy way torn box wrap and bent inner headphones cover.

Well my review on this Zebronics headphones. Talking of build quality looks ok but a bit on the softer side it could show up damages as one uses it
Testing the output
I checked all parameters like the bass, treble,mid range sound highs and lows.
1.Bass check. I played Nothing else matters by Metallica. I was surprised it did sound great. The bass was good the lead guitar great drummer excellent,bass guitar perfect and rhythm guitar great.
2. Played Abba. ""Volez Vous"" Impressed again great output. The bass was fine, singing great too.
I will update my review after further testing this headphones.
Comfort factor
Not that good i would say. The ears do get caught up and one cannot wear the head set for a long time.
Noise cancellation.
Not really that effective.
It's a good headset to listen to your music. I haven't tested the calling feature which requires the inbuilt mic. Cable length just fine. It's a simple headset at a good price too. Though one cannot expect more juice out of it as compared to high end ones
One shot. Good for it.; One of the worst headset I have ever buy in 1 months it work fine but after that 1 month the mics was not working the noise was not coming good do Liberty is not good it is the one of the first headphone I have ever seen in my life I put not recommend anybody to buy this headset this is a one of the bus headset in my entire life and I am not going to buy Zebronics product again and when it is not working fine I try to claim warranty but there was no warranty; Very sleek and apt product, value for money and clear sound quality.; Sound quality is good and base is good. But cannot wear for more than 1 hour as it starts to cause pain in ear due to incorrect size. The speaker size is small for most ear sizes and so it does not fit properly causing discomfort.; The quality of the sound is good; The head phones have great bass and is very durable and good quality but it's is not comfortable for more than 15 mins the earmuffs are smaller than you expect.; Audio quality is okay.. but wire quality is not good.."

As convenient and helpful wireless earphones are (I own a pair of AirPods Pro) ill always use a wired headphone for the following reasons
: better sound quality due to less transmission loss
: better mic quality
: safety (wireless earphones are more prone to being hacked )

Now to talk in more detail about the EarPods
They offer great vocals and the sound is really well balanced , these aren‚Äôt very bass heavy but they still have a very decent punch. I love the fact that it gets a tiny remote with the mic and physical buttons to control the music .
Yes it doesn‚Äôt have Spatial Audio or noise cancellation , but if you‚Äôve ever used an AirPods Pro I think you‚Äôll only really miss the noise cancellation .
The wires do seem a bit fragile as they aren‚Äôt braided but for the price I don‚Äôt really have much to complain .; it‚Äôs great, no compromise in music quality but the wire feels like it would break anytime.; It‚Äôs fake not working properly; So I have been using apple earphone for a year now and let me tell you it is worth it. The sound quality and wire quality is amazing. At first i was skeptical about the wire quality as it is very thin and I thought it will break easily but trust me it is durable and plus it is very easy to untangle the leads due to the quality of wire. I have no complaint from this. The sound quality is amazing and you can even hear the sound in crowded place as well unlike other airdopes or earphones which have limited sound quality. Just go for it. It is one time investment. I have tried other brands as well like boat and have purchased 2-3 airdopes in a year because one or another ear piece stopped working. So instead of investing 1000 rupees on another low quality brand, invest one time on this if you dont have budget for airpods. Also it is less hassle to keep these because other eardopes need charging and you have to additionally carry the charger. But this works amazing for me. Go for it; It is a completely original product and its sound quality is amazing and value for money. By wearing these airpods, there is no need to go to the air, it is full of fun.thank you Amazon for giving us great service üòÑ‚ù§Ô∏è; Good Product
Good sound quality; Cable is very weak but nice and sound quality good"

The green color adds a unique touch, though it may not be to everyone's taste. Overall, the Duke headphones are a great option for those seeking affordable, high-quality wireless headphones.; The best thing about this headphone is it give over the ear feature in 1299/- and its really confortable and also the bass is unexpectedly GOOD. And for audio volume level, It gives hearable sound in just 18% of computer audio and when i increase audio upto 100 i can hear even the base from 40cm far from the headphones.
As for comfort The cushions are really good, i was able to keep it on ears for 3hrs but not more than that cause it mae my head feel dizzy cause of hearing all my favourate melodies, old school, hip hop, rap and metal songs all at once LOL, But like other headphones i bought this one is stiff and feels like it will break if pressurised to stretch .
As for looks I love the RGB and the grill metal look it gives is DOPE along with plastic matte cover. It is quiet big like having two black and glowing eggs attached to ears but its worth cause the big egg things has lot of BASS inside LOL.
The battery life is incredible, I have been using it since yesterday and it still have 50% battery left.
ONLY PROBLEM is that I found the audio has sharp voice somewhat maximised to keep up with that heavy bass, like when you hear a song you will hear the vocals in sharp voice which is not actually pleasant. I counter this problem by using an equilizer in phone and laptop by decreasing the 14 KHz to some level and increasing 910 Hz to some level. And it only happens in bluetooth mode, The aux is perfect though.
Apart from all this I love my new headphone, Zebronics done a fabulous job by making it and selling it in such an affordable price.; "

Build quality is good and if you use it for an hour or more it won‚Äôt hurt ur ears like other headphones. Overall it‚Äôs a value for money for me.; You should absolutely go for this product, Best for gaming ,no sound lag even the Bluetooth connectivity doesn't feel any lag ,battery backup is also good, good build quality, light weight, soft cushioning, everything is so good as well as the price.Must Buy.; Its a new product by Spinbot and definitely worth the price . The build quality is decent, no metal just entirely plastic of good material also the ear cuffs and head band is covered with breathable cloth.. not foam or leather which is good indeed for sweat absorption but it makes your ears hot so need to readjust once in awhile amidst long hour of usage. Comfort wise its 7/10 for me because after every 20-30 mins my ears tends to hurt a little (might not be the case for everyone). But alas the biggest plus point is it comes with a detachable mic and multiple connectivity options such as aux(3.5mm to typeC), dual dongle(usb+typeC) and ofcourse bluetooth v5.3 which is good overall though i can feel slight latency problem while gaming only (some may not even notice it but unfortunately i do so i use the typeC dongle while gaming). Cuz with dongle its same as fast as wired. Battery is good so is the loudness. Lastly if any gamers looking for decent headphones around 2k. This is the one üëç; ; Headphones are really bad quality, I expected mediocre quality but it's really bad. I learnt that go for good brands, at least the brands you have heard of.; only good for calls, not for gaming or music; If you are buying this product for gaming it's an easy five star it had multiple connection methods, practically zero latency, great battery backup, but not exactly the best for listening to music or watching movies, but for gaming... It's perfect; I've been using these headphones for a week, and they are fantastic! The USB-A and USB-C dongles make connectivity with my laptop and phone seamless.

Product comes with 6-months warranty.","The casing for the headset looked like buying a brand not a loose plastic case but a box and moulded casing, Sound quality with deep bass thump, Soft on ears, the buds are softer than others. Liked the place where buttons configured on the left cup and looks premium. Grey and golden makes it classy. Audio jack included and connects well. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.
Thank you very much,
Your customer Armaan."

A WARNING of caution though i.e if you have an existing bluetooth 4.x or any other transmittor/chip to which you are connecting this headset then you might face jittering issues like I faced when I tried connecting with my older laptops with bluetooth 4 connectivity. Use only Bluetooth v5 or Bluetooth 5.3v minimum for its connection.

Mic performance is good in this price range and I am able to communicate happily. Its range is limited max of another room as it's of bluetooth v5.2 and not v5.3 but still a good range overall.

I would love if NG can have it zoom and skype certified as that would give us additional buttons to toggle mute from device itself.

As it's an open ear so don't expect this headset for music performance but you can use it for a while. Its main USP is teams communication and proabably podcasts too. As its open year to its must for summers as no sweating around ears.

Battery is good so far, works for 3 hours minimum so far.

Another good thing is it's bluetooth 5.2. I would be happier more if NG could upgrade this to bluetooth v5.3 as there a big signal range difference between v5.3 and v5.2. I already have bluetooth v5.3 transmitter. I am hopeful NG will look into it for future versions.

It's rain proof as well as have tested in a little rain during bike (for short route).

Overall good ratio of price to performance for people who are looking in this budget range. Will recommend NG again to launch a bluetooth v5.3 asap.; Edit‚Ä¶.. After reading positive reviews here I contacted Amazon Customer Service. Their representative determined I had a faulty set and arranged collection and refund. I cannot fault their service which far exceeded my expectations. Thank you Amazon.

I had high hopes for these but I‚Äôm bitterly disappointed.
The sound is distorted and tinny, the microphone quality is poor.

I teach English online and my students need to hear me clearly but each one complained about the sound.

I‚Äôm not sure if this was a faulty set or not but they are a complete waste of money. Only upside is they fit comfortably so would be great for long duration wear.; Using it now from past couple of weeks, works as expected. Less stress on ears and good sound and mic. Battery is just 6-7 hrs but rest all great till now.; It‚Äôs ideal for using when you‚Äôre WFH! It‚Äôs safe and has a good battery life. Totally worth the amount. Love it and I recommend it to everyone, it‚Äôs just great quality and amazing performance; The noise cancellation is absolute zero. The sound quality is also pathetic. I wanted it for skype calling but not the least satisfied with the sound clarity and quality and wanted to return it, but its next to impossible to raise a return request. They are coming up with many other alternatives to keep the product. We are not able to complete the return request. Pls don't buy this!! Its utter waste if you want to use it for calls. And CANNOT RETURN ALSO!! UTTER SCAM; Was pretty use to in-ear ear pods, but not always a good choice, certainly this style is way more practical when in office or out for a walk so definitely a great product at this price point, Before purchasing did compared it with other products which are more costlier then this one but honestly this has been as great value for money, am also surprised with the quality of mic, its sound quality is also superb.; Good sound quality but only for meetings not for music.
Gives connectivity issues during mid calls.; Pros
light weight.
Mic cancels surrounding noise quite decently.
Best for office use (calls and tutoring).
Sound quality is decent and clear but dont expect high quality acoustics.

Cons
Look and colour is not so good.
The band around the neck is not necessary
Which makes it little un portable.
Leaks hearable sound at high volumes to surrounding, since it is a open ear,,but user can able to hear properly.

Conclusion: If you are looking for a headset soley for calls (IT use), go for it."

It'd been 10 days, it didn't discharged to zero. Although I tried charging it..so it went very fast. Amazing Noise Cancellation .It has Bluetooth connectivity with multiple devices and also got ox cable for wired connectivity. I highly recommend it, if you want to spend monet on great wireless headphone.; 1,Appearances is good, good fit perfect balanced weight goes smooth and easy over the ears. But too much or usage might get little warmth but that‚Äôs okay I must say.
2. Value for money : yes sounds good clear voice and all instruments but can‚Äôt expect too loud sound and heavy bass. Because it‚Äôs simply not designed for heavy musics.
3.connectivity it‚Äôs very much better in this devise. Well I‚Äôve seen some connection drops in the darker area (I.e phones in pocket, phone in the bag or in the glove box of a car) but not too bad I must say, it fights really hard and good to maintain good connection.
4.build quality & attention: build quality is fair I can say a bit of mettle and major combination of soft plastic and cushion makes it light and strong. And yes people will look at what your wearing they show some good attention.

Conclusion :Just had this gig for some days that‚Äôs all . So far so good I can say. But the way they build this and tech used in this it should easily last for about 2-3 years. But be sure to buy some extra warranty for 2 years or something. Because JBL are such a brand where they show the best in the day and hides the worst for the night. I‚Äôve experienced it before down the line after manufacturing warranty there will be some issues that gives you surprises. Later you wish to repair it or simply buy a new one would your hard choice to make.; I like this product for the value for money it provides. I've been using this headphone for the past week and I'm happy to report that my experience has been pleasant while using these for a person who's not a hardcore audiophile.

PROs:
(a) Comfortable over the ear fit for average ear size; headphones do not feel heavy over long use
(b) Over par, more than advertised battery life. Easily lasts a week with heavy usage and ANC turned off. And 3-4 days with moderate ANC usage.
(c) App support is amazing on android. Provides the following features:
(i) Active Noise Cancellation
(ii) Ambient Noise Aware
(iii) Talkthrough
(iv) Self voice aware volume control
(v) Equalizer support (bass, extra bass modes pre-configured - +ve experience using them)
(vi) Separate Audio and Video modes for consuming content
(d) Almost negligible noise bleed
(e) Solid build quality. Tactile buttons. Travel friendly (foldable ear cups)

Some minor CONs:
(a) ANC could be better. Not very strong ANC
(b) Button placement could be better
(c) Foam in the ear muffs is built to last and not comfy if cups lay over your ear cartilages for long duration (if you have bigger ears).
(d) dark blue colour just looks horrendously cheap in daylight as outside shell material is plastic. Go for black, white or purple (if it ever comes back in stock); The ear pads are too small .. they hurt after few minutes of usage .
There was a weird line that looks like a crack on the side of the headphones and this isn't only on my product.
The Bass of the headphones is trash as well. The headband is tight and if extended they float over the head instead of resting when extended. The build quality of the Headband is as good as the Boat771 feels like it'll snap. Overall I'd rather the Boat 751 more then the JBL 770 In terms of Bass, Comfort, vocals .. the only up this headphones got over the Boat751 is the Noise cancellation.. which isn't even that good.
These headphones aren't worth 6k at all; Pros:
+ Super audio quality pretty much at all frequency level
+ 10 meter Bluetooth range with quick pairing
+ Better microphone quality
+ Better noise cancellation
+ Super battery life
+ Companior app to adjust audio mode and equalizer
+ Appropriate packaging
+ On-time delivery

Cons:
- Little costlier; ; Everything is fine except for the crackling sound that occurs during calls üìû, which happens consistently in every call. This makes me frustrated, honestly. However, other than that, normal audio sounds good and has quality.
One point to note is that it's not suitable for people who prefer high bass audio. Also, the building quality is good considering its price. Battery-wise, I would say it provides long duration.
Connectivity is fast enough to say it fast connectivity.
And jbl app is the main hero here, without app it's not worth using.
Noise cancellation: 3 out of 5

Value for money? : ....... May be.....may be not.... Personal opinion.

Charging: 4 out of 5; The headphones fit quite well. It is apt for all kind of people. It has got great comfort in its cushions as well as it is soft and comfortable. Its appearance also feels great. Quite a great one without anything fancy. It can be folded to fit into any bags for these. Coming to the quality, it offers a great deal of high quality surround sound feel but lags behind a little bit of bass boost. It has Bluetooth v5.3 making it very much easy to connect. Software updates are available for both headphones software as well as the languages in use. The applications covers a lot of options for us to configure the device. It is a great choice if you can buy during the sales.; O fone tem uma excelente qualidade, o custo benef√≠cio vale muito. O produto √© original, seu cancelamento de ru√≠do muito bom. Uma pena que n√£o d√° pra trocar as borrachas conforme o uso pois com o tempo elas v√£o gastando. Do resto o material √© muito bom. Vale a pena; Qualidade excelente, n√£o esperava menos.
A qualidade de √°udio √© muito boa e o encaixe tamb√©m, achei muito confort√°vel e se adapta a diversos formatos de cabe√ßa, mas acho importante ressaltar que ele pode ser apertado nas orelhas e a parte de espuma n√£o √© grande o suficiente para se encaixar do jeito mais confort√°vel, o que n√£o me incomoda, mas √© algo para considerar.
Como ele se encaixa muito bem, eu posso usar em v√°rias atividades di√°rias, inclusive para me exercitar, e ele permanece fixo sem nem amea√ßar cair.
A dura√ß√£o da bateria √© extraordin√°ria e eu posso us√°-lo confortavelmente durante v√°rias horas de estudo.
Recomendo, √≥timo custo-benef√≠cio.; Vamos l√°!

em rela√ß√£o a entrega:

chegou r√°pido, por volta de 10 dias a encomenda j√° estava na minha casa, veio perfeitamente embalado e nada amassado

em rela√ß√£o a est√©tica do fone:

muito bonito, n√£o √© muito leve e nem muito pesado, peso ideal!! O seu tamanho tamb√©m √© ideal, pois n√£o √© muito grande, ele √© dobr√°vel o que ajuda caso queira guardar na bolsa, vem com tr√™s bot√µes e a loga marca da jbl! Ele √© fosco lind√≠ssimo

em rela√ß√£o a conforto:

√ìtimo! Ele √© justo e n√£o fica folgado na cabe√ßa, mas n√£o se preocupe, n√£o √© t√£o apertado a ponta de incomodar, uso ele pra fazer muscula√ß√£o, corrida, crossfit e outros exerc√≠cios que exigem muitos movimentos, ele simplesmente n√£o sai do lugar, eu tinha essa preocupa√ß√£o, mas superou minhas expectativas.

em rela√ß√£o ao som:

Espetacular! O volume √© alto, abafa muito bem os ru√≠dos, voc√™ n√£o consegue ouvir o que as pessoas dizem ao redor, um ponto interessante dele √© que vc pode se afastar o quanto for que o fone n√£o desconecta, n√£o baixa o som ou qualquer coisa do tipo

em rela√ß√£o a bateria:

√© surreal a dura√ß√£o da bateria, estou usando h√° uma semana e ela n√£o est√° nem na metade!! Obs: uso todos os dias por volta de 2hrs a 3hrs, acredito que deve durar mais ou menos duas semanas tranquilamente

Por fim, se voc√™ busca um fone com o pre√ßo bom, com durabilidade de bateria espetacular, com som bom, voc√™ precisa comprar esse fone!!! Apenas comprem, n√£o ir√£o se arrepender; Estava h√° muito tempo buscando um fone de ouvido Bluetooth com cancelamento de ru√≠do ativo at√© 500 reais, at√© me deparar com esse da JBL. Opini√£o ap√≥s um m√™s de uso: espuma muito confort√°vel, utilizo o fone o dia todo (e uso √≥culos), se encaixa bem na cabe√ßa e n√£o tive problemas nem correndo at√© o metr√¥. Possui cabo p2 remov√≠vel, mas devido a dura√ß√£o da bateria, s√≥ usei para testar (carrego o fone uma vez a cada 2/3 dias, com uso continuo). Cancelamento de ru√≠do bom (nada excepcional, mas cumpre seu papel). Apresenta ru√≠do em trepida√ß√µes (como em trens/metr√¥), possivelmente vindo do microfone, mas nada que atrapalhe muito a experi√™ncia. Padr√£o de qualidade sonora cl√°ssica da JBL, com foco nos graves acentuados. Recomendo a compra!; Good product, so far i everything is good."

Hard to believe that its made in India by a lesser known Indian firm. Superlative quality earphone. Sound clarity is awesome with the richness augmented by superb bass, with rich mids as well as the trebles. Precision quality Sound that I have never experienced even in a costly Sony or Philips earphone. Noise cancellation is also very good. Listening to the Bollywood melodies of the 90s in SPOTIFY PREMIUM was a pure bliss with this earphone. Just received the product 2 days back and right from day 1, its stupendous. Wonder how such high quality earphone can be priced so cheap (Rs 249) !
Initially I was a bit hesitant to purchase this just bcz it's made by a less known Indian firm. But going by the public reviews, I decided to experimentally purchase it. But then I was simply awestruck by the quality.
In a nutshell its a total value for money (4.8 out of 5). Sound quality: 4.9 out of 5, bass: 4.6/5, mids: 4.7/5, treble: 4.4/5.
Sound Clarity: 4.7/5
Braided cable: 4.5/5.
Only con:
1. The earbud does not fit properly inside ear, and often feels like it has got disoriented.
2. The cable from on off button to the earpiece is very thin and feels vulnerable.
Durability: not known.
Overall its an unbelievably great piece of earphone for quality sound lovers who don't prefer bombastic sound or extra bass, but like clarity and fidelity of sound.
The sound is quite crisp and perfect for Bollywood like melodious genres rather than bass heavy or metallic genre.
Its a must try product.
Makes me feel proud that yes India too can design and build premium quality electronic products indigenously.; Product is really nice. Sound quality is very good. Wire is covered with fabric cloth like material which makes it durable and lasts long.; First Impressions:
The product packaging was neat and simple and we get extra ear buds and the earphones (of course). I was impressed with everything about it because i rarely see something like this under 300 price range.

Build Quality:
The cable is braded and looks very nice, I'm not sure how long will this wire will hold without getting broken. It's only been 1 day since I got the product but I will give a update..

Sound Quality:
The bass are amazing, especially low ends and the mid bass basically it's great! Neodymium drivers was used in this earphones and it's known for giving more bass than dynamic driver. Mids wasn't disappointing the best I have heard in this price range. High ends were kind of irritating because I listen on a high volume but reduce the volume to a reasonable amount, then it's really good!

Mic Quality:
The mic's voice quality is good, but listener can definitely hear background noise but at this price range some earphones mic won't even work and i was proud for this one.

Extras/Passive Noise Cancellation?:
I'm not a professional audio guy just a random dude who loves to listen to music and this was the best to listen to compared to the other earphones i bought. Also because this was an in-ear it pretty much mutes ambient noise very nicely especially the earphones fits perfectly in my ears. It's definitely not an ANC device but the Passive Noise Cancellation was good!; I bought it last year but it's one side earbud stopped working and then the wire cur automatically. I don't liked the build quality but yes sound is good.; I bought this one and after sometime one side of the pair creating issue of voice break and claim warranty. Service is seriously poor, MIVI memeber just replaced a damaged and dirty n used earphone of somebody and returned it to me.
I recommend to stay away from MIVI product.; It is an excellent product .It last for an year .it has good mic quality and it is very clear to hear music; Best in budget but ears gets pain when we use for long time; Why i ordered this product?
Actually i wanted to order a gopro hero10 and i need that before 30th dec 2021... So for emi options i was registering myself for amazon pay account on 23rd dec 2021... So during that time for kyc verification purpose it said like, in-person verification is needed and will done at ur next order delivery. So i decided to order something cheaper with one-day delivery and i came after this with 250rs.. I ordered one and got delivery by today (24th dec) and done with my kyc verification and was in a decision to apply for a return without even opening the parcel... But all of a sudden i decided to give it a try and then return that one to check how it sounds.

About the packing :
As soon as i opened the packing the box was in new condition without any damaged edges and the color seemed like a razer box with that green and black combo... Then i opened inside and saw a white compartment with neatly packed and placed product and also a warranty card... I thought it would be like 3/6 months but they have mentioned like 1 year (though it was mentioned in the box outside i didn't takeit serious)... What???? For a product of 250rs 1 year warranty... Its unbelievable... And then they have provide 2 pairs of ear buttons that u can use if it wear out. That's all about the packing.

About the earphone:
What they have did is just top notch... The quality of the product is good and strong enough... The wires are braided, though its thin, i think it may last more than a year if not handled ruggedly. The sound quality is just AWESOME... It seemed like r u kidding me mivi.. But the truth is - it is super duper awesome mind bogglingly phenomenal... To be frank u cant get a product like this for this money (my opinion and i didn't tried any other headset under 1000rs but i have tried the skull candy headset which was famous during 2017-18 college days cost around 1500 to 1800rs). I can say that its sound quality is same like the skull candy i used once. Even me and my dad tried the mic and it was crystal clear...
Just one word - HATSOFF mivi team. You guys just nailed it. Keep rocking and don't just reduce the quality in future for any reason and never ever do that.

And the best thing is i m not gonna return this product...

This review is just my first impression on day 1 of getting the product... I'll update it after 30 days of usage... Let's wait and see how this product handles..."

- bass is fine
- Type - C charging
- Rapid charging, just charge for 10min and use for 2-3 hours

Cons -
- the ANC is kinda just for name, I can clearly hear fan sound , click ticking and other things , but after playing music of course we can't hear these things well
- plastic build quality but from wht I can see it's a durable and good quality plastic
- Not ""that"" Comfortable, its a bit heavy compared to my old headphones
- your ears will sweat, yep, I feel my ears getting hot

Overall, perfect deal for 2k; The sound quality is worse than a headphone in the same price range which was released 4 years before this one and its too laggy even in high end device.
And there isnt a return policy so am stuck with this which is my bad as i didnt check.; Sound quality is good but can be better especially bass. Build quality can be little better. Call quality is good. Battery backup is excellent. Overall value for money at this price.; This is absolutely value for money product. I like the design and build quality. Sound quality and bass experience is also very impressive in this price range.
ear sponge is very soft and comfortable for long time use.; Build quality is not up to the mark and has doubt on it's durability and flexibility. Sound wise okay but not that good.; Pros :
1) Amazing sound quality but bass response could be better
2) There is voice feedback for every change in game mode or ANC
3) Mic is good
4) Soundstage and sound seperation is good
5) Good build quality as in expensive headphones
6) Great Battery Life

Cons:
1) Don't expect ANC here

Sound Quality:
The sound quality of the Q20i is nothing short of exceptional. The headphones deliver a rich, balanced sound with crisp highs, deep lows, and a well-defined midrange. Whether I'm listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the audio reproduction is consistently impressive. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) feature effectively minimizes external noise, providing a more immersive and enjoyable listening experience.

ANC Performance:
The ANC on the Q20i works like a charm. It significantly reduces ambient noise, allowing me to focus on my music or conversations without any distractions. This feature has proven particularly useful during commutes and in noisy environments, making the Q20i a versatile companion for various settings.

Comfort and Design:
The comfort level of these headphones is outstanding. The memory foam ear cups provide a snug fit without causing discomfort, even during extended listening sessions. The adjustable headband ensures a secure and customizable fit. The sleek design and premium build quality add a touch of elegance, making these headphones not only functional but also stylish.

Battery Life:
The battery life of the Q20i is impressive, easily lasting through extended use. The convenience of quick charging is an added bonus, ensuring that I never have to wait too long to get back to enjoying my favorite tunes.

Versatility:
I appreciate the versatility of the Q20i. The headphones come with a durable carrying case, making them travel-friendly. The foldable design allows for easy storage, and the inclusion of an aux cable ensures that I can continue using them even when the battery runs out.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Anker Soundcore Q20i headphones are a fantastic investment for anyone seeking a high-quality audio experience. From the impressive sound quality and effective ANC to the comfortable design and long-lasting battery life, these headphones deliver on all fronts. I highly recommend the Q20i to fellow music enthusiasts and anyone in search of reliable, feature-packed headphones with excellent value for money.; Buy it for its sound quality for the given price point under normal mode operations. Build quality is very sturdy and solid. Almost at par with some premium price headphones. If you like customizing the sound settings to your own taste, this is the headphone which gives you sufficient flexibility to do so. The default sound quality may not be of the highest standards and is more leaning towards higher bass notes. still the high notes are visible enough to compensate for the over powering lows. With the equalization settings you can fine tune these short comings and achieve absolute thrilling and enjoyable music tune. Dynamic range is respectable and the sound stage is great, engulfing you into the rythm. It is very light and comfortable to wear, just remember under the hot and swearty condition please avoid as the area around the ear cups will start sweating and become uncomfortable. Battery back up is awesome. without noise cancellation and under medium volume you can squeeze more than 60 hours easily. I am not a big fan of transparency mode, but it has its uses, which i think should be activated when you start speaking or some else speaks to you. the continous on under Transparency mode lets all the noises in to your headphone through the mic, which spoils the musical experiance. The noise cancellation is OK, the is a visible difference in sound quality the moment it is activated. which deafeats the purpose of listening to a good music. It requires a lot more refinement through firmware updates. But i guess at this price point one cannot expect much on noise cancellation front. Overall a great value for money product from soundcore.; I recently bought this headphone, so this is an early review of my experience using it

Overall
Pros - 1. It is budget friendly
2. It has a very good noise cancelling
3. Premium feeling
4. Very less or no sound leakage at full volume
5. The Transparency, Normal and NC works quite well
6. Charges very fast, 5 min=4 hr and within 90mins full charge
7. Contains a Type-C and 3.5mm Aux cable
8. Contains metal+plastic extension
9. Very soft cushion(ear pads)
10. The head cushion is also very soft
11. Can be folded
12. Good clamping force so it doesn't easily falls off
13. The mics work very nice
14. Very good sound quality if you can set the EQ properly
15. Nice comfort
16. Ear pads are replaceable

Cons - 1. As the clamping force is strong so wearing it for hours without opening may give you headache
2. Not for rigorous use as the plastic body can get scratches
3. No cover/pouch is not given so probably buy a headphone cover to take it for travels
4. The buttons are not very tactile and feels a bit wiggly
5. The EQ is not good as you need to set it according to your preference and it is very time consuming...the base soundcore preference is very bad but according to me the acoustic and piano were very good.
6. The Type-C cable is not very long
7. Even if the head cushion is soft, don't get tricked by its real like feeling as it is not real leather
8. Wearing around your neck can give you this heavy weighted feeling but it is not a major con for this headphone
9. The buttons are literally clamped into one single side, just need to get used to the buttons position

Overall it is a very good budget friendly noise cancelling headphone which I always wanted, it gives a similar experience like the ones of jbl770 nc or Sony ch720n...maybe the sound quality maybe be not soo good like them but what more can you expect from a ‚Çπ4500 headphones. Headphones of this price range also doesn't gives a similar experience like the q20i. I hope you liked the overall review!; Se escuchan muy bien, la bater√≠a les dura mucho y son c√≥modos, 100000/10 üò≠üò≠üíñüíñ; I have been using these headphones for a couple weeks and they are a great value. Sound quality isn't premium like Bose for my podcast listening but listening to tunes has been enjoyable. Certainly the quality is good enough for the price point. These headphones rest comfortably on my ears and are easy to turn on/off. Battery life has been superb so far. I like that you can fold up 1 side so they store a little more compactly. Was reasonably straightforward to connect to my phone and PC without downloading the app. You can slightly hear the noise cancelling when sitting in a quiet room, though it's not bothersome, and when I wore these for a walk I was almost stunned by my neighbors who I couldn't hear walking behind me. So the noise cancelling works. I certainly would buy these again.; Super casque, rapport qualit√© prix imbattable.

Port agr√©able apr√®s qq heures d √©coute
Foncer, Anker une valeur s√ªre; Ik sta eigenlijk versteld van de prijs / kwaliteits verhouding, de geluidskwaliteit is erg goed en de noise cancelling werkt heel fijn!
Bouwkwaliteit is redelijk, jammergenoeg geen berscherm tasje of iets inbegrepen maar voor deze prijs is dat geen ramp.
Een aanrader voor de muziekliefhebber die graag met stilte wilt genieten!"

Were should we goo??; Compact adapter. It helps me charge my 2 devices at the same time. I have recommended this to my friends too!; This multi-port fast charging adapter has really made charging my devices easy and quick! Best part is that it doesn‚Äôt heat up the devices while charging. Came in a clean and minimal packaging and the adapter is sleek in design, which I like! Worth purchasing! Highly recommended!; Working with atleast 3 gadgets at one time also meant carrying three chargers with their wires tangled into one and God forbid you forget any one of them. I wanted to try out Sortd to make things less cluttered everytime I sat down for work and declutter it did. Also, the fact that it's so fast at what it does, i think I can get a fourth device now.; Well, overall I am confused and completely disappointed. I had purchased to overcome the cable management with my laptops, smartphones and iPad. Individual charging is good with the recommended 100W cable from the same brand. But when I opted out for 2 mobiles (C to C ), my S22 ultra started rejecting it and when I plucked with laptop and 1 or 2 smartphones the laptop üíª started unaccpting charging but not the smartphones. Sometimes for laptop itself showing to use the adapter which comes with laptop (65W).

Now trying to charge my S22 Ultra and iPhone 12 Pro max, the one another reject to charge and device force to remove the cable. Disappointed

Only one device u can charge at a time. Waste of money.

Recommendation: Definitely, No; Perfect replacement for my broken oneplus charger. I can say way better. Amazing purchase in this price range. Loved the tiny and compact shape."

We make that happen for you with Tru Bass, Tru Balance and Tru Rock.; 10mm Driver:- Dive into the world of balanced audio quality.; ENC for superior calling:- Experience a clear calling experience when you talk on the phone with Environmental Noise Cancellation.; Low Latency (up to 50ms):- Gaming, talking or listening to music - it‚Äôs a lag-free zone with up to 50ms of low latency.; Sporty elegant design:- Designed for flexibility and comfort, making your audio experience look as great","The FIRST and primary features is the microphone. The other person in line can hear my voice crystal clear and without any background noise. (Most of the bluetooth headphones have unpleasant background noise and with the person on the other end not hearing us properly )

SECONDLY, the battery back up is incredible. It can last a day with frequent use and lose only about 10%-20% of the total capacity.

THIRDLY, the buttons are placed distinctly and protruding, which makes it very convenient. (Yes flat buttons are confusing and we tend to press the wrong ones)

FOURTH point is that the bass quality is pretty good.
Other advantages includes good quality plastic and wire material, even the ear plugs are soft and comfortable. The magnet also works well and the bluetooth doesn't get disconnected even when they gets attached. (some bluetooth gets disconnected when the magnet gets attached or kept un used for a while, which i find it very inconvenient)

The ONLY DISADVANTAGE i find is that even the lowest volume is loud for me, especially while using it at night or when your surrounding is calm.; I actually purchased this product as I was tight on budget. I searched for a lot of neckbands and bought this. Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
1. The build quality and look of the neckband feels premium and durable compared to Mivi collar 2

2. Sound quality is quite good..it gets loud enough but not too loud. Bass is on point and overall you get a very well balanced sound quality.

3. The battery life is simply amazing. It lasts for about 3 days and my usage is 3-4 hours per day.

4. It has a Qualcomm chipset which is okayish for this price point. Noice cancellation is also average.

5. It supports dual pairing- this means that you can connect upto 2 devices with this neckband and the audio switches automatically as you go from one device to another (however I noticed a delay of 2-3 seconds).

6. Mic quality is good enough. The other person can hear clearly.

Cons:

1. You do not get AptX or AptX HD. For those who don‚Äôt know these are Bluetooth audio codecs. You can google it out and see which audio codecs does your phone support. If you are an iPhone user like me then you can use this as iPhone only supports AAC codec.

2. You do not get a thumping bass. So for bass lovers I do not recommend this. If you like a more balanced and crisp sound then go for it.

3. Latency - as it does not have AptX HD so it has latency while gaming compared to Boat rockerz 335 and OnePlus wireless buds (YouTube, prime, netflix works fine)

4. It has micro usb port. This product was launched in 2020 but still has a micro usb port instead of a type C.

5. There is a hissing sound continuously on this and boat rockerz which I did not notice on mivi collar 2

Conclusion: Well if the pros and cons did not help you out then here are my final thoughts on this. If you are someone who likes to listen to a lot of music and not overwhelming bass then this product is really good. The battery life is great you get atleast 10 hours of battery on 80-90% volume. It‚Äôs not for gaming so don‚Äôt buy it just for gaming purpose.; Nice product, Batery life is also good & sound quality is marvellous; I have to change my mind its worthless stopped working in a usage of short duration, i request that kindly ignore below conclusion, its useless don't go with it

In this Review i will be covering good and bad aspect and how genuinely it seems to me at first sight, it depends on insight and experiences and gives you general idea about whether you should purchase it or not, following points given below:-

Prosüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

Delivery:-i am restless kid who don't believe in waiting, trust me Amazon,s key point that will never disappoint and never want you to wait so long. The only exception is that when order reaches from other city then it takes 4 to 5 days, which as per the usual process considerable

Box Content:- it comes with noise registration leaflet, manual, micro usb cable, extra pair of earbuds

Connectivity:-Its perfect but lags somehow, its hard to proceed far away. Mainly it depends on obstacles how it works.

Battery:- i haven't charged it since the day product arrived and with mixed usage, battery level not yet reduced despite of mixed and moderate use. And still manage to be at 80%.

Sound quality:-
Considering the price point, audio is just perfectly balanced the good point is its a blend of perfect tuning. Seperation of instruments and vocal can be easily identified. In short music lovers will start loving it, apart from that extra bass is just gimmick. Else its brilliant and produce best sound, songs feels bit low and average in normal mode but when turn to extra bass mode then the sound accompanied by bass. In short its sound and audio is just perfect for what is right, balanced thats what made it so different. Trust me i was skeptical and i returned 6 to 7 earphones and headphones just because they have not met my expectations but it stands on my expectations, brilliant work.

Cons:-üëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

Bass:-üòî
To remind that functional button is there change the mode from normal to extra bass, its just a gimmick and need a thoughtful touch before introducing it.it doesn't work that way they condemn it.

Build quality:- no doubt its perfect, but its earbuds are quite old fashioned, design is just overtly laid which were downside and i don't like that much.

Noise cancellation:- There is no reduction of noise however its one bad aspect considering the price points

Ear buds:- Doesn't fit well in my ears, its not that they came but it seems to be loosened and noise could have given in ear design,metal housing is not there, and earbuds were overtly designed, its modern trend to have in ear design which fits perfect and it lacks these qualitiesüòî

Conclusionüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

bought these neckband although this could be premium and stay around for a while, to say its premium and classy but can't beat boat rockers 255 in terms of bass. Apart from bass its perfect comparing to boat rockers, dont know about the durability, At first glance these neckbands are show stealers. Trust me sound quality is what you need then you may go for it, considering its bad aspect you may also prefer to ignore; This neckband is good for general use, if you lookinh for bass‚Äî don't buy it.
however sound quality is pretty good in terms of clear audio. But Music Lovers, it's not for you.

Magnetic Tips are just to keep it together, it doesn't have any function!
When you connect tips ‚Äî
‚Ä¢ it doesn't pause your music
‚Ä¢ it doesn't Disconnect your BT.

i found BOAT ROCKERZ much better purchase in terms for functionality and music.

And there is no RETURN POLICY. so purchase it wisely.; Really appreciate your product for it's good quality sound, unique design and great looks. Keep going. Thank you."

So without hesitation I got this product stringz 38 lite in green colour. The sound for half in ear design is pretty amazing. Bass is awesome not overpowering and of course not disappointing at all. The call clarity is also great given the placement of mic is nearer to mouth. Durability - 10/10 other products at this price has a thin wire but this has comparatively thick wire. Connectivity - 10/10 it is seamless and given that mic is nearer to mouth one can hear clearly on the other side.
Comfort - 10/10 the half in ear design is intelligently designed by ambrane. If you see other brands, they are alike to apple's earpods but this one has a unique touch to it - the extended outlet near speaker grill that allows sound to direct in ears without much loss and also protecting the speaker grill from accumulating ear wax - this is seriously a clever implementation by ambrane.
Volume control - It doesn't have any volume control button but at any volume you listen to given that phone nowadays don't go above recommended volume level unless manually permitted, this absence isn't a deal breaker at all.
Portability - 10/10 You can easily carry this in your travel organiser bag or in pocket without worry. Of course according to the condition like crowded buses or trains one has to take precautionary measure out of discernment to protect their earphones it can be the most strongest earphone but if proper care is taken it will last longer to serve you and your needs you see! ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Irrespective of the precautionary cares you may take, it is not super delicate so yes toughness is there. But it is advisable to protect it just like you protect your phone even of it claims to have strongest screen quality ‚ò∫Ô∏è; At 199 this wired earphone is good value.
Pros:
#1: voice call is clear as the mice rests comparatively much nearer to your mouth.
#2: Wires are strong enough.
***
Cons:
#1: As the ear pieces don't have earbuds noice cancelling is not so good.
#2: Bass is not much
#3: No volume control; Clear sound, good, durable,light and nice performance; The company packaging seems a bit off, as these are canal type earphones but were packed in earbud packaging (ref.images), also not very neatly done, felt like used before.

The build is OK, earplugs (canals) are bigger than normal which may be good for some people but felt tight for me, also there's a slight tilt and sharpness at the edge that makes it uncomfortable, not ideal for longer durations.
Sound is OK for ‚Çπ249 earphones (black color), but mine came defective for the first time.
The audio was getting muted in patches frequently, and there is no option for return so raised a replacement request.
Will update once received.

[UPDATE]
Quality: The quality isn‚Äôt sturdy and wires after L-R separation are prone to breakage easily.
Sound: Distorts any higher than 50% of volume (used with YouTube on my old iPhone). Highs & Lows are bad, ie. you‚Äôll get the music but sometimes not the voice very clearly.
Worth: Not worth ‚Çπ249 for sure, I‚Äôve compared these with a Portronics earplug set (canal type) that came free along with another order, been using it since 5-6 months now, price of those earplugs on Amazon was ‚Çπ199 then.; Bass leader balanced treble
Perfect headset at best buy price
Best product with high standards üëå; Performance is good. Durable is used cautiously.... Light weight.. mic quality is good... Warranty to be checked...; Go for it. Nice buy; Although I purchased this for Rs. 199 but still I have rated it bearly average. I found that the sound is loud but it is not very clear. The ear peice has slight sharp edges that irritates the ear and prolonged use will surely create abrasion inside the ear which is not good.

With an impressive 60 hours of playback time, they are perfect for users who need reliable headphones for long listening sessions. While they lack active noise cancellation, the overall performance and features make them a solid choice in their price range. The green color adds a unique touch, though it may not be to everyone's taste. Overall, the Duke headphones are a great option for those seeking affordable, high-quality wireless headphones.; The best thing about this headphone is it give over the ear feature in 1299/- and its really confortable and also the bass is unexpectedly GOOD. And for audio volume level, It gives hearable sound in just 18% of computer audio and when i increase audio upto 100 i can hear even the base from 40cm far from the headphones.
As for comfort The cushions are really good, i was able to keep it on ears for 3hrs but not more than that cause it mae my head feel dizzy cause of hearing all my favourate melodies, old school, hip hop, rap and metal songs all at once LOL, But like other headphones i bought this one is stiff and feels like it will break if pressurised to stretch .
As for looks I love the RGB and the grill metal look it gives is DOPE along with plastic matte cover. It is quiet big like having two black and glowing eggs attached to ears but its worth cause the big egg things has lot of BASS inside LOL.
The battery life is incredible, I have been using it since yesterday and it still have 50% battery left.
ONLY PROBLEM is that I found the audio has sharp voice somewhat maximised to keep up with that heavy bass, like when you hear a song you will hear the vocals in sharp voice which is not actually pleasant. I counter this problem by using an equilizer in phone and laptop by decreasing the 14 KHz to some level and increasing 910 Hz to some level. And it only happens in bluetooth mode, The aux is perfect though.
Apart from all this I love my new headphone, Zebronics done a fabulous job by making it and selling it in such an affordable price.; "

Let's start with the positives. The earphones provide a snug fit, ensuring comfort even during long listening sessions. The 10mm drivers deliver satisfactory sound performance, allowing you to enjoy your favorite music and audio with clarity. The passive noise cancellation feature is an added bonus, as it helps immerse you in your audio experience by reducing external noise distractions.

Connecting the earphones to your device is a straightforward process. Simply plug in the 3.5mm audio jack, and within a few seconds, the earphones sync with your phone or tablet, ready to deliver audio.

On the downside, the build quality of the earphone cable raises concerns. Some users have reported that the wires are not as sturdy as expected, making them susceptible to damage and tangling. This weakness in the wire construction may impact the longevity of the earphones, requiring extra care and attention during use and storage.

The ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones come in a sleek design and are available in multiple color options, including Black, Blue, Green, Red, and White, allowing you to choose the one that suits your style.

In terms of technical specifications, the earphones have an impedance of 16 Œ© and a frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz. The 1.2-meter cable length provides adequate flexibility for comfortable usage.

It's important to note that these earphones come with a 6-month warranty, which provides some assurance in case of any manufacturing defects or malfunctions within the specified period.

In conclusion, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones offer decent sound quality and a comfortable fit, making them suitable for everyday use. However, the durability concerns surrounding the wire strength are worth considering. If you prioritize longevity and robustness in your earphone choice, you may want to explore other options. Nevertheless, if you handle them with care, these earphones can provide an enjoyable audio experience at an affordable price point.; The ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones present a mixed bag of features, catering to both audio quality enthusiasts and comfort seekers. With a snug fit and 10mm drivers, these earphones ensure a comfortable listening experience coupled with satisfactory sound performance. The passive noise cancellation feature enhances immersion by minimizing external distractions, ideal for music aficionados or those seeking solace in audiobooks during commutes.

Connecting these earphones is hassle-free, thanks to the straightforward plug-and-play mechanism. However, concerns arise regarding the durability of the earphone cable. Users have reported issues with wire sturdiness, highlighting susceptibility to tangling and damage. While the sleek design and color variety add aesthetic appeal, the compromise in build quality prompts cautious handling to prolong their lifespan.

Despite durability concerns, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones boast technical specifications such as a 16 Œ© impedance and a frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz. The 1.2-meter cable offers adequate flexibility for daily use. Additionally, the inclusion of a 6-month warranty provides reassurance against potential manufacturing defects, offering peace of mind to consumers.

In summary, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones deliver a comfortable fit and decent sound quality, suitable for regular use. However, prospective buyers should weigh the durability issues against their preferences. While these earphones offer an enjoyable audio experience at an affordable price point, those prioritizing longevity may opt for alternatives with sturdier construction. Nonetheless, with proper care, these earphones serve as a budget-friendly option for casual listeners.; The product is working except in Video Calls on WhatsApp; It's a good earphone with good quality music and base offered in this price range
But not for long use because of the thin wire it can break at any time
By the it's comfortable to wear to it and also is a good fit for small ear as well
The quality and Clarity in mic is just ok in this price; Sound quality is good but it's not very durable but I guess it's understandable for that price"

Pros :
1.Sound Quality - 5/5
The Q10 headphones provide an impressive audio experience with outstanding sound quality, delivering sharp highs, full-bodied mids, and impactful bass. Whether I'm enjoying my preferred tunes or immersing myself in a movie, they ensure a balanced and engaging sound. Notably, the bass response adds depth and resonance to my music without overpowering the rest of the audio range. Furthermore, the Soundcore app offers numerous Equalizer and tuning options that make a discernible difference in the sound output.
2. Fit and build quality - 4.5/5
Comfort is a top priority for me, and the Q10i doesn't disappoint. As they are Over the ear , the memory foam ear cups provide a full and comfortable fit, allowing for extended listening sessions without any discomfort. The adjustable headband is also rigid. The overall build quality feels great , the cups did seem wobbly after few but doesnt feel like a weak point . The foldable design adds convenience for storage and portability, making them easy to carry in a bag or case , I already got a case which fits the headphones without any issues : https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B08JTMCSM9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

3.Battery and Connectivity - 5/5
The battery life is impressive as well. I've used them for several hours on a single charge, and they still had plenty of juice left. Additionally , this supports 3.5mm jack so we can plug in them if battery runs out
The Bluetooth connection is smooth, and I haven't encountered any problems with pairing or signal interruptions. The controls on the ear cups are user-friendly and straightforward, enabling swift adjustments to volume, playback, and handling calls.

Con:
1. Mic Quality - 3/5
I'm not impressed with the mic quality. The person on the other end did say that the voice is quite low even though I'm speaking loudly . The issue is more persistent with Bluetooth , while I did not get any negative feedback while using aux cable. Also , this doesn't come with a pair of aux cable which is a bummer.

2. Weight - 3.5/5
Even though the headphones are comfortable , at first usage/ first few mins it feels heavy on the head and neck. Just a nit picking con.

3. Not a big con but there is a lack of active noise cancellation, but considering the price point, it's not a deal-breaker. The passive noise isolation is still effective in reducing ambient noise and works flawlessly, so good that once I keep it on at a mid noise environment , I dont hear outside noise .

The Anker Soundcore Q10 headphones are a value for the price. Providing exceptional sound quality, comfort, and long battery life, these headphones stand as an excellent choice for music lovers and anyone in search of a reliable pair of wireless headphones. I recommend them to those looking for a dependable and budget-friendly audio solution.

Overall I'd rate this 4.5/5; Recived today, good product.
Pros:

Amazon packing was not that good as the package was litle bit broken.; I agree it is an excellent headphone at given price. However, the volume of headphone does make you feel the price vs product comparison.

1. Well built and headphone cover the ears perfectly.
2. Headphone cushions are of good quality. Person in the front can also hear the sound.
3. Voice clarity is immaculate.
4. Does not hurt your ears even at high volume.
Cons:
1. Little heavy built compared to other Hps, however output is really good.
2. At 100% volume you can hear excellent base
3. Wearing head phones for long hours in summer is giving sweat.
4. Cloth materials could have been improvised.; I recently purchased the Anker Over The Ear Headphones, and I must say I'm thoroughly impressed with their performance. These headphones have exceeded my expectations in several key areas, making them a fantastic choice for both music enthusiasts and everyday users.

The first thing that struck me was the exceptional sound quality these headphones deliver. Whether I'm listening to my favorite music, watching movies, or even taking phone calls, the audio is crisp, clear, and immersive. The bass is deep without overpowering, and the mids and highs are well-balanced, allowing me to enjoy every note and detail in my music.

Wearing these headphones for extended periods is a breeze, thanks to their plush ear cushions and adjustable headband. They fit comfortably over my ears without causing any discomfort or fatigue. I can wear them for hours without feeling the need to take a break.

Anker really nailed it with the battery life on these headphones. I was pleasantly surprised by how long they last on a single charge. I've used them for several days without needing to recharge, and that's a huge plus for me.

The headphones have a solid construction and feel durable, but I'd have liked a bit more metal in the build for added sturdiness. However, I've been careful with them, and they seem to be holding up well so far.

Pairing these headphones with my devices is a breeze. They connect quickly, and I haven't experienced any signal dropouts or connectivity issues. The Bluetooth range is also impressive.

While the noise isolation is good, it's not the best I've encountered. It effectively blocks out most ambient noise, but some higher-pitched sounds may still seep through. However, it's not a deal-breaker for me, as it's still quite effective.

In summary, these headphones offer an incredible listening experience, comfort, and impressive battery life. They're an excellent value for the price, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Whether you're a music lover or just looking for a reliable pair of headphones for everyday use, these should be at the top of your list. I highly recommend them!

Pros:
- Outstanding sound quality
- Comfortable for long listening sessions
- Impressive battery life
- Easy and reliable connectivity

Cons:
- Slightly better noise isolation could be desirable
- Build quality, while good, could be more robust
- The headphones are a little loose on my head (maybe because of my small skull size :) ); I've been using the Soundcore Q20 headphones for a few weeks now, and I am thoroughly impressed. These headphones deliver exceptional sound quality and noise cancellation, all at a fraction of the cost of more premium brands.
The sound quality is outstanding, with deep bass and clear mids and highs. Whether I'm listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the audio is consistently crisp and immersive.
The active noise cancellation (ANC) feature works remarkably well, effectively drowning out background noise in a variety of settings. It's perfect for commuting, working in noisy environments, or just enjoying some quiet time.
The headphones are lightweight and very comfortable, even during extended use. The ear cups are well-padded and provide a snug fit without being too tight. The overall design is sleek and modern.
Battery life is another standout feature. I can easily get up to 40 hours of playback on a single charge with ANC off, and around 30 hours with ANC on. Charging is quick and convenient with the included USB-C cable.
Considering the price, the Soundcore Q20 offers incredible value. It competes with much more expensive models in terms of performance and features.
If you're looking for high-quality, budget-friendly noise-cancelling headphones, the Soundcore Q20 is an excellent choice. It delivers superb sound, effective noise cancellation, and great comfort, all at an affordable price point. Highly recommended!

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ; Si bien no soy como otras personas un ""reviewer profesional"" o que me dedique a esto, puedo dar los suguientes puntos en base a mi experiencia personal tantoc o melomano como musico por hobbie.
En mi uso de audifonos tengo algunos en gama y costos similares, como son los JBL LIVE 500, Audio-technica ar3bt, Urbanista Seattle....
Estos Anker mi primera impresion fue, que tenian bastante bajos que ensuciaban el resto de la pista, a diferencia de los otros 3 modelos que mencione eh utilizado... si bien no me desagradaba, estaba considerando la calidad de audio que ofrecen los puse en ultimo lugar de mi lista de gadgets...
PERO O SORPRESA....cuando active el Anc (cancelacion de ruida activa) wwoow.... si bien por si sola la cancelacion pasiva hace muy buen trabajo, esta funcion mejora levemente la eliminacion de ruido ambiental, PERO, tambien cambian las frecuencias la musica que estas escuchando dandele una sensasion de amplitud y claridad a la musica que no tenian en mis anteriores audifonos. Los bajos pasaron a estar en segundo plano, OJO no desaparecen simplemente todo esta en un mejor balance, pero con esto todos los intrumentos escuchando rock, suenan claros estan presentes, mejoro bastante la calidad del sonido y precencia en escenario. En musica electronica tambien tienen una sobresaliente actuacion por sus bajos y potenciador de bajos electronicos que activas con un boton en los audifonos.
CONCLUSION, recomendados!!!! definitivamente Anker es una marca que lo viene hacieno bien ultimamente.
MATERIALES, CONSTRUCCION Y PRESENTACION, si bien la caja y los empacas no son de lo mas eleborado y lujoso, hasta parecieran algo de baja calidad, los audifonos los partes plasticas se ven de muy buena calidad, definitivo parece que soportaran el uso diario y algo de trato rudo pueden soportar si los cargas en tu mochila con mas cosas. Las almohadillas cubren bien tu oreja y te aislan del ruido exterior, son comodas, un poco calientes al ser piel sintetica, pero tolerables.; Tecnicamente, √© um excelente produto com graves bem equilibrados e som bem cristalino. Mas comprei o fone para tentar eliminar o barulho de uma obra vizinha. O Noise Cancelling dele √© muito bom, apesar do quase impercept√≠vel white noise. Deixa um pouco de ru√≠do se usar muito baixo, mas resolveu o problema de barulho externo. Almofadas confort√°veis que cobrem toda a orelha e isso ajuda mais ainda. O acabamento √© bom, nada excepcional, mas cumpre a fun√ß√£o. Comandos externos de f√°cil acesso e a bateria duuuuura longas 40 horas (sem NC). Valeu cada centavo!; These headphone have a great sound frequency range and are very comfortable to wear. The battery lasts a long time between charges even with heavy use. The option of having them wired or Bluetooth is another great thing with these headphone. I also have the Q30s and both are well made. The company is great to deal with if you ever have an issue and go above and beyond to help sort things out l.; Bought these for a friend's birthday and gotta say we were all impressed. It's not the best pair of headphones in the world, but will definitely be fine for normal users looking for NC that benefits the experience. If you want to get in to NC headphones but not break the bank I would definitely recommend these."

- plastic build quality but from wht I can see it's a durable and good quality plastic
- Not ""that"" Comfortable, its a bit heavy compared to my old headphones
- your ears will sweat, yep, I feel my ears getting hot

Overall, perfect deal for 2k; The sound quality is worse than a headphone in the same price range which was released 4 years before this one and its too laggy even in high end device.
And there isnt a return policy so am stuck with this which is my bad as i didnt check.; Sound quality is good but can be better especially bass. Build quality can be little better. Call quality is good. Battery backup is excellent. Overall value for money at this price.; This is absolutely value for money product. I like the design and build quality. Sound quality and bass experience is also very impressive in this price range.
ear sponge is very soft and comfortable for long time use.; Build quality is not up to the mark and has doubt on it's durability and flexibility. Sound wise okay but not that good.; Pros :
1) Amazing sound quality but bass response could be better
2) There is voice feedback for every change in game mode or ANC
3) Mic is good
4) Soundstage and sound seperation is good
5) Good build quality as in expensive headphones
6) Great Battery Life

Cons:
1) Don't expect ANC here

Earcups are small.; The Built Quality is Good but The sound quality is not great. Good ear pads and battery life"

Your headset is shipped in power saver mode. The headset is only 10% charged. Failure to do so may cause connectivity issues.,"I recently purchased the OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless In-Ear Earphones, and I am thoroughly impressed with their performance. Here are the key highlights that make these earphones a fantastic choice:

**Exceptional Sound Quality:** The Bombastic Bass is truly remarkable. Whether I'm listening to music or watching videos, the sound is rich and immersive. The audio clarity and depth are excellent, making every listening experience enjoyable.

**Fast Charging:** The fast charging feature is a game-changer. With just 10 minutes of charge, I get 20 hours of music playback. This is incredibly convenient for someone with a busy schedule. I never have to worry about running out of battery.

**Long Battery Life:** The 30-hour battery life on a full charge is outstanding. I can use the earphones for extended periods without needing to recharge frequently. This makes them perfect for long trips, workouts, and daily commutes.

**Comfortable Fit:** The in-ear design is comfortable and secure. The earphones stay in place even during rigorous activities, and I don't experience any discomfort even after prolonged use.

**Easy Connectivity:** Pairing the earphones with my devices is quick and hassle-free, thanks to Bluetooth 5.0. The connection remains stable, and I haven't encountered any dropouts or lag.

**Built-in Mic:** The built-in mic ensures clear and crisp call quality. It's great for hands-free calls, and the voice clarity is impressive.

**Stylish Design:** The Acoustic Red color is vibrant and stylish. The design is sleek and modern, adding a touch of elegance to my tech accessories.

Overall, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless In-Ear Earphones offer exceptional value for money. They combine excellent sound quality, fast charging, long battery life, and a comfortable fit in a stylish package. I highly recommend these earphones to anyone looking for a high-quality audio experience.; There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.

The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.
Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.

You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.

As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand‚Äôs audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.
If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.

That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.

They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.
The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.; One plus bullet is worth for money. Sound quality is amazing with clear voice feature. Design n material of product is worthy üôå. And got at best of it's price...so definitely no complaint at all.; Been using the Z series past 4 years was quiet satisfied but i was bit spectical about the Z2 ANC in terms of ear fitment and noise cancellation to my suprise its working too good and satisfied with the product and the cost price.; Sound is good everything is alright provided it is hard many times to connect neckband from Bluetooth,either I have to off it or forgot it and pair it again.
Product is of good quality, comfortable in ears and can use easily while doing other activities,battery is okay.Only problem is to connect it from android phone.; I bought this one because of the ANC, and i am quite impressed with the noice cancellation. Eartips are small though but not a problem i can buy it seperately. I was not expecting the sound quality because I use iem earphone as well but the sound quality is quite impressive, best for music like edm mix. Bass is impressive also. Not for music like classical but other than that it is good to listen other genres of music. Connectivity is quite fast and easy and switching between devices as well. Satisfied with battery life as well.; I charge it once a week and it works effortlessly. It‚Äôs very comfortable to use and the neck band is adjustable. I like the quality of sound and would recommend it.

Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.

With an impressive 60 hours of playback time, they are perfect for users who need reliable headphones for long listening sessions. While they lack active noise cancellation, the overall performance and features make them a solid choice in their price range. The green color adds a unique touch, though it may not be to everyone's taste. Overall, the Duke headphones are a great option for those seeking affordable, high-quality wireless headphones.; The best thing about this headphone is it give over the ear feature in 1299/- and its really confortable and also the bass is unexpectedly GOOD. And for audio volume level, It gives hearable sound in just 18% of computer audio and when i increase audio upto 100 i can hear even the base from 40cm far from the headphones.
As for comfort The cushions are really good, i was able to keep it on ears for 3hrs but not more than that cause it mae my head feel dizzy cause of hearing all my favourate melodies, old school, hip hop, rap and metal songs all at once LOL, But like other headphones i bought this one is stiff and feels like it will break if pressurised to stretch .
As for looks I love the RGB and the grill metal look it gives is DOPE along with plastic matte cover. It is quiet big like having two black and glowing eggs attached to ears but its worth cause the big egg things has lot of BASS inside LOL.
The battery life is incredible, I have been using it since yesterday and it still have 50% battery left.
ONLY PROBLEM is that I found the audio has sharp voice somewhat maximised to keep up with that heavy bass, like when you hear a song you will hear the vocals in sharp voice which is not actually pleasant. I counter this problem by using an equilizer in phone and laptop by decreasing the 14 KHz to some level and increasing 910 Hz to some level. And it only happens in bluetooth mode, The aux is perfect though.
Apart from all this I love my new headphone, Zebronics done a fabulous job by making it and selling it in such an affordable price.; "

I haven't heard this good quality in any of the headphones in this price range. Powerful bass which stands out and doesn't muffle up other frequencies.. thanks to the quality 13mm drivers.

We make that happen for you with Tru Bass, Tru Balance and Tru Rock.; 10mm Driver:- Dive into the world of balanced audio quality.; ENC for superior calling:- Experience a clear calling experience when you talk on the phone with Environmental Noise Cancellation.; Low Latency (up to 50ms):- Gaming, talking or listening to music - it‚Äôs a lag-free zone with up to 50ms of low latency.; Sporty elegant design:- Designed for flexibility and comfort, making your audio experience look as great","The FIRST and primary features is the microphone. The other person in line can hear my voice crystal clear and without any background noise. (Most of the bluetooth headphones have unpleasant background noise and with the person on the other end not hearing us properly )

SECONDLY, the battery back up is incredible. It can last a day with frequent use and lose only about 10%-20% of the total capacity.

THIRDLY, the buttons are placed distinctly and protruding, which makes it very convenient. (Yes flat buttons are confusing and we tend to press the wrong ones)

FOURTH point is that the bass quality is pretty good.
Other advantages includes good quality plastic and wire material, even the ear plugs are soft and comfortable. The magnet also works well and the bluetooth doesn't get disconnected even when they gets attached. (some bluetooth gets disconnected when the magnet gets attached or kept un used for a while, which i find it very inconvenient)

The ONLY DISADVANTAGE i find is that even the lowest volume is loud for me, especially while using it at night or when your surrounding is calm.; I actually purchased this product as I was tight on budget. I searched for a lot of neckbands and bought this. Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
1. The build quality and look of the neckband feels premium and durable compared to Mivi collar 2

2. Sound quality is quite good..it gets loud enough but not too loud. Bass is on point and overall you get a very well balanced sound quality.

3. The battery life is simply amazing. It lasts for about 3 days and my usage is 3-4 hours per day.

4. It has a Qualcomm chipset which is okayish for this price point. Noice cancellation is also average.

5. It supports dual pairing- this means that you can connect upto 2 devices with this neckband and the audio switches automatically as you go from one device to another (however I noticed a delay of 2-3 seconds).

6. Mic quality is good enough. The other person can hear clearly.

Cons:

1. You do not get AptX or AptX HD. For those who don‚Äôt know these are Bluetooth audio codecs. You can google it out and see which audio codecs does your phone support. If you are an iPhone user like me then you can use this as iPhone only supports AAC codec.

2. You do not get a thumping bass. So for bass lovers I do not recommend this. If you like a more balanced and crisp sound then go for it.

3. Latency - as it does not have AptX HD so it has latency while gaming compared to Boat rockerz 335 and OnePlus wireless buds (YouTube, prime, netflix works fine)

4. It has micro usb port. This product was launched in 2020 but still has a micro usb port instead of a type C.

5. There is a hissing sound continuously on this and boat rockerz which I did not notice on mivi collar 2

Conclusion: Well if the pros and cons did not help you out then here are my final thoughts on this. If you are someone who likes to listen to a lot of music and not overwhelming bass then this product is really good. The battery life is great you get atleast 10 hours of battery on 80-90% volume. It‚Äôs not for gaming so don‚Äôt buy it just for gaming purpose.; Nice product, Batery life is also good & sound quality is marvellous; I have to change my mind its worthless stopped working in a usage of short duration, i request that kindly ignore below conclusion, its useless don't go with it

In this Review i will be covering good and bad aspect and how genuinely it seems to me at first sight, it depends on insight and experiences and gives you general idea about whether you should purchase it or not, following points given below:-

Prosüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

Delivery:-i am restless kid who don't believe in waiting, trust me Amazon,s key point that will never disappoint and never want you to wait so long. The only exception is that when order reaches from other city then it takes 4 to 5 days, which as per the usual process considerable

Box Content:- it comes with noise registration leaflet, manual, micro usb cable, extra pair of earbuds

Connectivity:-Its perfect but lags somehow, its hard to proceed far away. Mainly it depends on obstacles how it works.

Battery:- i haven't charged it since the day product arrived and with mixed usage, battery level not yet reduced despite of mixed and moderate use. And still manage to be at 80%.

Sound quality:-
Considering the price point, audio is just perfectly balanced the good point is its a blend of perfect tuning. Seperation of instruments and vocal can be easily identified. In short music lovers will start loving it, apart from that extra bass is just gimmick. Else its brilliant and produce best sound, songs feels bit low and average in normal mode but when turn to extra bass mode then the sound accompanied by bass. In short its sound and audio is just perfect for what is right, balanced thats what made it so different. Trust me i was skeptical and i returned 6 to 7 earphones and headphones just because they have not met my expectations but it stands on my expectations, brilliant work.

Cons:-üëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

Bass:-üòî
To remind that functional button is there change the mode from normal to extra bass, its just a gimmick and need a thoughtful touch before introducing it.it doesn't work that way they condemn it.

Build quality:- no doubt its perfect, but its earbuds are quite old fashioned, design is just overtly laid which were downside and i don't like that much.

Noise cancellation:- There is no reduction of noise however its one bad aspect considering the price points

Ear buds:- Doesn't fit well in my ears, its not that they came but it seems to be loosened and noise could have given in ear design,metal housing is not there, and earbuds were overtly designed, its modern trend to have in ear design which fits perfect and it lacks these qualitiesüòî

Conclusionüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

bought these neckband although this could be premium and stay around for a while, to say its premium and classy but can't beat boat rockers 255 in terms of bass. Apart from bass its perfect comparing to boat rockers, dont know about the durability, At first glance these neckbands are show stealers. Trust me sound quality is what you need then you may go for it, considering its bad aspect you may also prefer to ignore; This neckband is good for general use, if you lookinh for bass‚Äî don't buy it.
however sound quality is pretty good in terms of clear audio. But Music Lovers, it's not for you.

Magnetic Tips are just to keep it together, it doesn't have any function!
When you connect tips ‚Äî
‚Ä¢ it doesn't pause your music
‚Ä¢ it doesn't Disconnect your BT.

i found BOAT ROCKERZ much better purchase in terms for functionality and music.

And there is no RETURN POLICY. so purchase it wisely.; Really appreciate your product for it's good quality sound, unique design and great looks. Keep going. Thank you."

1. Comfort- the cushions are smooth and perfect. You can listen to long hours without any discomfort
2. Build quality is good for this price range. These aren't too hard on ear too
3. Sound quality is very good. You can expect that from skullcandy. Tones are good. Bass is not very high but enough for a normal listener. If you are a bass lover, then that's some drop for you.
4. Sound quality is more better with the aux connected as is the case with all other wireless headphones
4. Charging 10 min give upto 1hr 30min of listening time. Good for taking and making calls
Cons: 1. I think the audio volume is not great. You can't hear it loud enough till you increase it to more than 70%
2. No noise cancellation but upto 60% of the noise is impeded by the on ear cushions. You can't expect more noise cancellation at this price.

Overall, a great purchase. Highly recommended at this price range. Don't doubt. You can go for it; Earlier I was using Sony MDR XB450 and tried JBL tune 500Bt. JBL was not at all comfortable so I returned it. So I tried üíÄ. This Headphones are the best compared to both. Bass is just Perfect. Cushions are very comfortable. You can use it for 3-4 hours easily without any pain on ears. Skullcandy will never let you down. If you are confused then go for it.; I purchased it one year before, July 2021, now it is Sept 2022. What I liked about this product is the battery. But what is the use if the exterior gets random cracks? There are cracks forming around the headset and apparently the bass has also gone worse. Do you want a product that goes well just for a year or you want to buy something that lasts longer? I used to have Sony, was good but the cushion was poor. I opted for Skullcandy for an upgrade but I think I rather go back to Sony.; I do strength training mostly, and some running. Never fallen off once. Do get a bit hot due to on ear design.

These are perfect for when u need that bass to slap you like your dad when he sees your math grades.
11/10.

p.s not for casual listening, when u can actually hear the rest of the music its quite muddy, unless you lower the bass on EQ; I recently purchased the Skullcandy Cassette Wireless On-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black) from the Amazon.in app, and I must say that I am quite impressed with the sound quality and bass experience they offer. The headphones provide an immersive audio experience, allowing me to enjoy my favorite music, movies, and games with exceptional clarity and depth. The sound reproduction is crisp, and the bass is powerful, adding an extra dimension to my audio.

The build quality of the product is impressive when you first purchase it. The materials used feel sturdy and durable, giving a premium look and feel to the headphones. The cushioned ear cups provide a comfortable fit, allowing for extended listening sessions without any discomfort.

However, after approximately a year of use, I did notice some issues with the durability of the product. The sponge padding on the headphones started to tear, which was quite disappointing. I initially thought it might have been due to sweat, but considering that the headphones are advertised as water-resistant, I expected them to withstand such conditions. This made me question the practicality and true effectiveness of their water-resistant claims.

Overall, I would still recommend the Skullcandy Cassette Wireless On-Ear Headphones for those seeking the best sound quality and bass experience. However, it's important to note that the durability may be a concern after a year of use. If you decide to purchase this product, I would advise being mindful of the potential wear and tear on the sponge padding. It is crucial to manage your expectations and understand that the headphones may not hold up as well over time.; Sound quality is average and at full volume it can also be used as a speaker from headset its loud without any quality at full volume if u listen at low volume its good . comfort level is really low if you wear this for more than 30 mins your ears will start paining . Overall I dont suggest anyone to buy this headset .; I have been used many headphone of different brands such as bose jbl etc but i found this headphone the best i bougth it for rs 2600 and i have been using it from 4.5 years and they are still look like new and have the sound quality and comfort same as when it was new i prefer you to buy this; Si lo tuyo es subir el volumen al m√°ximo, estos audifonos son ideales, sonido con mucho poder y gran calidad en el bajeo, SONIDO POTENTE!
Adem√°s de ser comodos y ligeros, excelente opci√≥n!; I've been getting this brand for years and they never disappoint! Great headphones with great sound! Amazing price and good value. Charges easily and quickly and hours of use!; Update, love the sound and comfort with these headphones but they all break the same according to the other reviews. I purchased a second pair that came broken in the same way the other pair I ordered from here broke. üòì
Beneath is my old review. I would suggest spending more. I got lucky with that one pair I raved about below.
The plastic is very low grade and it will break in the same place even if you‚Äôre gentle

OLD REVIEW
I adore these headphones. I wear them just about every single day and at the gym. They stay on, are comfortable (padding at the top of your head) the sound quality for $40 cannot be beat, very decent.
These are under $40 and have a great connectivity. Sometimes I charge my phone in a room while I‚Äôm in the kitchen and it remains connected!

In the gym I get highly sweaty and they work beautifully and have held up to being sanitized every day.
I‚Äôve accidentally stepped on them and crushed them as well as throwing them in my bag and wearing them in rain storms (multiple times).
I am irresponsible with them üòÇ they‚Äôve held up. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing that but if you do they‚Äôll most likely survive.
I‚Äôve spilled coffee on them etc. you name it.

They have small cracks at the sides due to my negligence that are hardly noticeable.
Charging is fairly quick.

I would strongly recommend them.

Love the pricing, the quality and I feel they‚Äôll be great for another 2 years or so. Once they‚Äôre done I can see myself returning for another pair or having them repaired. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

If you‚Äôre seeking something cheap, cheerful and reliable; these will get the job done!

Also, I‚Äôve worn them for crazy long hours at a time and have never once had them die on me? üòÇ I charge them at the end of each night as I use them daily.; Scoperte a Stansted ma non avevo tempo di acquistarle. Ne ho prese due paia (una per me e una per mia figlia). Sono cuffie fenomenali, gran resa nei bassi, il suono √® bello corposone. Un po' scarso il microfono per le telefonate, ma uno le cuffie per prende per ascoltare la musica (il thrash metal esce da Dio; When using it on my Samsung TV, the minimum volume is too loud.
I would like to push the volume down, just to protect my ear (but that is not possible)."

It does not feel like this has been built to last, thanks to a lot of crappy plastic everywhere. The sound quality is very good and similar to other rivals at this price range. I also have a HyperX Cloud Core, and the sound signature of both seems similar, although the Sony one sounded more crisp to me in certain games. Pairing is hassle-free. The crowded left can with all the controls takes some time getting used to, and I‚Äôd have preferred it had they integrated some of the functions as touch-based gestures, especially with all that unadorned plastic on the outer surface of the cans. It also helps that the headphones follow a more muted styling compared to most third-party rivals.; Headphones amazing but only with play station 5 is you want to you with mobile thats impossible or irritate bc headset work with dongle(non bluetooth headphones); after trying out many wired & wireless headphones for PC

Its amazing. I am fully satisfied with it.
Pros-
1) It just a perfect headset for gaming, listening to songs, etc.
2) It gives a theatrical effect while listening.
3) It is stylish and i've had an amazing experience using it

Cons-
1) It has a split microphone and earphone wire so you're gonna have to buy a splitter (or whatever its called).
2) It has a large wire so you're gonna have to tuck it all in to use it while travelling.
3) While playing games on phone (Pubg FTW), the gunshot noise comes out i dunno why.
4) There are no real cons...this headset is just perfect!; Update:- After installing Realtek Audio Drivers, sound is OK. Though noise cancellation still Aweful.

Product looks very well built. Good material and perfectly crafted. Looks and feels premium. But as they say, looks can be deceiving.
Coz as soon as you start using it, then it shows its true colors and realises you that a cheap product cannot compete with a good one, no matter how premium that looks.

Sound is too low... You can barely hear other players while playing games. Noise cancellation of the mic is horrible. Too much background noise for the listener. I tried to play COD Warzone twice with this headset keeping mic On but both the times I was asked to turn off the mic by my teammates.

I never had such problems with my Boat Rockerz 255 Pro Wireless.

I even replaced the first piece I received coz I thought that was faulty. But when I received the replacement piece and found same problem with new one as well, then I understood that the product doesn't has the potential which someone can expect. Hence Now I am writing this long review.

In short- Product is not worth to buy.. you will have no benefit except spending some spare money. You will merely be able to use this headset in games because you won't hear anything and your team mates will hear everything but your voice.; It is a really good headphone with multiple features and I am very satisfied with all the features that it provides in this price range; I got this headphone at 796 Rupees.
Here is my Honest review (If you are PUBG/CS:GO or any other these types of game player, then don't read this, I have not tested on those.) -

Sound Quality 9/10 - Loudness is good, Sound will leak at full volume of headphone. But you won't need full volume because it is already good. It is good for movies and music. It has 50mm drivers.

Mic Test NA/NA- Could not do, but it is fine. You can go for mic, it is good. Mic can only move up and down.

Comfort 2/10 - Not at all comfortable for long sessions, like it is not at all comfortable, if you are looking for a headphone with good comfort, don't go with this. This is my personal opinion, at first when I wore, my ear started to pain in 10 Minutes, but after few hours, I learned to do some adjustments and pain lowered little, but still not comfortable. Its weight is also too much, earcups shape is square, but it should be oval shape, so it is clear that it will pain ears. I returned this headphone because of no comfort.
Second Point - It is not flexible, so it is too tight on the ears. It is adjustable according to your head.
Third point - Earmuffs are not breathable, so ears will sweat in few minutes without AC. But you won't feel sweat so no need to worry.

Cable 10/10 - Good cable, it is braided, you will need splitter to use it in mobiles and laptop. Must buy gold plated splitter for clearness of mic and sound. Cable length is good too.

LED - It is not RGB. But it doesn't matter

Controller in Cable 9/10 - Mic on/off switch is good, but volume controller needs to be improved, it is very very loose, but not a problem. Otherwise, it is too big, it needs to be small

Weight 6/10 - You can see, this headphone's weight is 480G, nearly half Kilograms. So, for first time, you will feel uncomfortable, so, you will have to get habitual to it.

Build Quality 9/10 - Build quality is good, not flexible, but it will last a long. You can go buy this if you want good build quality. It is very sturdy.

Left and Right 10/10 - I have tested it with 8D audio and both channels work very fine. You can buy if you want good left and right audio channels.

Overall Rating - 7/10

Should you buy it? If you want comfortable, don't buy this, you will regret. For those who do gaming for long hours, it is not comfortable.

If you don't care about comfort, then you can go for it. It is good.; Not compatible to my gaming console; I didn't have high expectations as it was from cosmic byte and looked a bit too flashy but when I first saw it, I absolutely loved the design and the build quality. The cushioning is great and it's comfortable. It also dropped from my table and I knew it had to be damaged but there was just a scuff and the sound quality was same. I am impressed. The sound compares with JBL C100SI. It has a little less bass than the JBL but it is good enough for headphones. The sound is equalized though a bit more clarity would be appreciated. For listening music the performance is average but for games, it is better than the C100SI. As for movies, it's good, not great(clarity). For this price, you won't get better headphones than these. Go for it!; This is really a good product.. Sound is loud, base is fine, can be used for music, comfortable and have modern design.. mic quality is also good for gaming.. the only thing I didn't like is the quality of the wire.. wire looks weak.. although we will see how long this headphone works properly.; Yes, a headphone review product can be helpful in determining whether a particular headphone is good or not. These review products often provide detailed information about the audio quality, build quality, comfort, and other features of the headphones. Reading and watching headphone reviews can give you an idea of how well a headphone performs and whether it suits your preferences or not. However, it's important to consider multiple reviews and take into account different perspectives to get a comprehensive understanding of a headphone's performance"

The battery is very good but the charging cable is very short in length.
Built quality is very good feels premium. It's quite smaller than expected and I faced but fitting issue it's quite loose on my head
Connectivity is very fast & Dual Pairing.

Overall I'm satisfied because these days good headphones at affordable range rarely exist. This headphone completes my need of a portable and folding headphone with long lasting battery. The only issue which I found is the sound leakage rest is fine.; I've been using these headphones for a while now. The build quality is excellent and they're definitely not as heavy as some of the other reviews suggest. They're a little tighter around the ears, but that's not a problem for me. It helps with the passive noise cancellation, which is cool. The sound quality is quite good, and listening to music on these is a lot of fun. You can tweak the sound using several equalizers in the app. Keep tweaking until you find what works best for you. These headphones can also be used to consume media other than music, such as videos. The headphones come with Bluetooth 5.0 and AUX support in case you run out of battery. So far, I haven't had any problems with the connection. It's stable and works well when you move around a bit. The battery is the best thing about this product. It easily lasts well over a week on one charge, which is great because I use it every day. So far, I've been really pleased with this product. They're a little pricey, but they're definitely worth it!; The fit is good. Sound quality is outstanding also build quality is premium very comfortable.; These are absolute steal in this price! The design, colour, sound quality and battery life are amazing. The battery life is actually super amazing! I use them for 5 hours straight and the battery doesn't even drop down 1% which is mind boggling. For someone like me who listens to music for long hours, the battery life is a blessing. My head is a little sensitive so it starts hurting though, otherwise I can wear them for 10 hours straight. I got these on 11th May and Today is 18th may. I recieved them at 40% that I have charged them only once till 80% and used them continuosly everyday. I still have that 80% battery left. The colour is beautiful. The sound quality is really nice for the price range. Better than Boat ones for sure! The bass and the treble is perfect. The music feels heavenly at 80% volume. Even though the body is plastic, it feels premium. I was doubtful about this colour due to lack of photos and reviews but I am super glad I went for these, they look classy! Calling is also much better than the boat ones I had earlier. All-in-all, you will not be disappointed after using these.; Fast charging and long-lasting for me cuz I dont use it continuously all day
Sound wise its good
Quality of the product top notch. Came with dust bag,2 types of charges cable and leather quality is sooo goood and soft and it doesn't affect the ears but it will if u gonna use for a long time like any headphone does .
Calls -I dont think its good, the other person can hear you only if there is no distractions like fan and background noises and ull hear all the background noise when ur listening to songs.
So I think there is more options out there for this price so look for other options.; After using completely for 2 days (only removing it for sleep), i can say that sound quality is really good, the sound mixing is good and the overall sound feels dynamic but it causes pain after an hour or two. Then, there is significant sound leakage when the volume is above 80.

i was listening to music, when my parents was sleeping, they literally woke up due to sound leakage from the headphone. To give perspective, when the headphone is listened on max volume, outside people can hear it as sound 20 or 30. This is bad....

So buy this if u want an good looking headphone with good sound output but remember the cons: heavy, can't wear it for long hours, sound leakage

i am thinking of returning it.. to get a over the ear headphones; ; Buenos aud√≠fonos, calidad en el sonido y en el volumen. Por el tipo de aud√≠fono no ofrece un aislamiento completo del ruido pero la esponja hace muy bien su trabajo para camcelqr sobresalientemente el ruido exterior.
Una ventaja es que son Muy ligeros y c√≥modos por lo que puedes usarlos durante mucho tiempo si. Que sean molestos por el peso o que lastimen la cabeza y orejas.

La mayor ventaja que le veo es el aplicaci√≥n que se puede descargar para configurar el tipo ecualuzacion que se desea dependiendo del g√©nero.; The bass boost on these are crazy. They do cinch to your head nicely where they won't fall off so easily like other headphones I've had. They charge pretty fast and the battery life for me last a while because I'm a music fan so I love to listen to music for hours on end. I think it's a good value I wish they were a little bit cheaper but they are definitely a good deal and they do go wherever you go bluetooth availability and it also has an aux cord just in case. I love them. And the color is a plus as well also the cushioning on the ear portion is soft it does get a little sweaty though. Also they are very loud which I love as well and they are noise canceling.; I have been a fan of Anker cords so when I found nd myself looking for a set of headphones, these stood out to me. the reviews were good, the battery life promise kind of hooked me and so I thought I'd give them a shot. I was not disappointed! The sound is amazing compared to ones I have used before. The ear pads are smaller than full coverage so they aren't the best for noise cancelling (but somewhat). They connected very easily and feel nice on my ears. The battery life is amazing. I have charged them in the week or so since I got them but only because of habit (my old ones could barely go a day).
The one problem I have with them is they feel wide and big on my head and I wish I could make the adjustable band a bit smaller to be more snug on my head. I just have a small head so if you have a large one, great, lol!
Anyway, I'm impressed and hope they last me for a long time to come.; Der Klang dieses Kopfh√∂rers ist gut - aber auch nicht mehr. Es fehlt etwas an Klarheit, daf√ºr ist die Lautst√§rke sehr gut und der Bass abartig - und f√ºr mein Empfinden viel zu viel wenn man den Bass-Boost aktiviert. Der Tragekomfort ist ok, wenngleich dieser Kopfh√∂rer schon deutlich auf die Ohren dr√ºckt. Die Bluetooth Verbindung und Reichweite ist tadellos, die Akku-Laufzeit exzellent.
Das Beste aber an dem Kopfh√∂rer ist das wirklich exzellente Preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis: All das um nur EUR 20.- ist nat√ºrlich der Hammer - deswegen trotz der angef√ºhrten Mankos 5 Sterne.; Amazing quality, amazing sound, beautiful clear microphones, lovely bass, unmatched battery life, fits well and easy to setup, as an audiophile who has owned over 20 pairs of headphones, at this price point, they are unmatched, with an amazing free app that syncs your equaliser settings between devices"

Liked the place where buttons configured on the left cup and looks premium. Grey and golden makes it classy. Audio jack included and connects well. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.

I wanted something of a neutral sounding headphones.

And I say that if you're more of a bass lover this might not meet your expectation but

This headphones are very good neutral sounding headphones means every frequency is well balanced. Lows-Mids-Treble

High end frequencies are little less compare to other headphones but the sub bass and bass quality is very good.

I'm not a fan of more high end frequencies but to some users it might sound less energetic on that area compare to lets say beyerdynamic or audiotechnica headphones.

Personally I like high end of this headphones because of the balance and not harsh highs , I can listen to it for a long time.

And noise cancellation is also good.

COMFORT LEVEL:

At first these headphones might be little tight on your head and is the reason for noise cancellation also.

The cups are comfortable and will cover your whole ears.

The headphones will get comfortable to your liking after some time you can adjust the size with slider above the cups.

BUILD QUALITY:

At this price range I think the build quality is good

Headphones are foldable and light.

But the wire is non detachable and cable is heavy so I think I have to take care of it and not be reckless about it.

So I don't think these headphones are made for walking and listening type

These are made for sitting in one place and listening type.

FINAL VERDICT:

I make music and I heard that most of mixing engineers use this to mix their beats so I ordered it

I like this headphones because it met my expectations.

At first you might not be able to grasp the sound stage of these headphones because you might not used to these type of headphones.

Sound quality is good and almost neutral.

I am not using these as my headphones for gym and I am not taking it with me when I go outside.

It's not like you can't take it outside , the headphones are light weighted but cable is heavy and non detachable that's why.

After using it sometime and grasping the sound stage, I can listen in this headphones for hours and pick little details in the songs too.

So read this and based on your application you can choose whether to take it or not.

Note: I saw the pictures online of this headphones and I found that that were two models.

One is old one where on back of the cup of headphones, Sennheiser hd 280 pro 64 ohms is written

Second is new model where only HD 280 PRO is written

So don't get confused with the images shown when you receive these headphones and don't find Sennheiser 64 ohms written on back of the cups.

Cheers!; These circumaural/over the ear headphones have a flat sound perfect for studio use. Designed around the venerable Sennheiser HD 250 Pro Linear monitors these are a set of headphones recommended for studio use or critical sound analysis only. Sound is far easier on the ears than the A-T M40x/M50x with comfort level that is head and shoulders above that experienced with the A-Ts. The A-T M70x are excellent monitors but I would prefer the Sennheisers over them any day.

Sound - 5 stars, relatively flat, bland, but revealing. They take time to open up, a good 24-48 hours of use. These are not bright nor do they have boosted bass like the A-T monitors. They are easy on the ears both sound and comfort wise and makes me understand why Sennheiser pro monitors are one of the most popular with professionals.

Construction - 4 stars, plastic all around but very good quality plastic. Not a single creak or noise during use. These are made in Ireland, like many of Sennheiser's high end headphone products including the HD 600/650 and initial batches of 660s which are now made in Romania. The top end HD 700/800/800s/820 are made in Germany.

You get a detachable (with a torx screw driver) straight cable which is only about 1.5 m (approx. 5 ft long) and this I believe is a key short coming compared to the A-T M pro monitor range which come with 2-3 cables depending on the model.

Comfort - 5 stars, very comfortable ear pads that accommodate even large ears. These are such a pleasure to use compared to most A-Ts.

Sennheiser's after sales support is second to none, having experienced it for myself over the 11+ years that I have owned the HD 650 and subsequently several other Sennheiser products. This makes recommending the HD 300 Pro very easy. Highly recommended. If you want a less expensive monitor consider the very good VFM HD 280 Pros which have comparatively brighter sound and are aimed squarely at the A-T M40/M50x.; I got tired of buying cheap headphones that break easily and don't regret paying extra for these at all. I've been frustrated why so many companies try to save a few cents making such thin cords that break in a few months only to lose money replacing them on warranty. This actually has a cord built to last and it's coiled so it's flexible. The cord is a bit short though for my setup so I use a cord extension to make sure it doesn't get tugged and damaged.

I'm not an audio professional but the sound quality is amazing to me and a lot more natural sounding. The bass it has feels like having a subwoofer. The frequency response is rated for 8 Hz but from my testing at typical listening volume levels it can only noticeably play tones as low as 11 Hz, which is still pretty good. It also surprisingly blocks out a lot of outside noise too, about half as much as the hearing protection I use at work.

I also love that they're comfortable and so adjustable. I like to pull one side behind my ear while singing so I can hear myself and they still fit to my head perfectly.; I can finally code without hearing my roommates doing group activities!!!; Im Gegensatz zu Billigdingern, geht nicht kaputt! Sitzt fest und trotzdem angenehm auch √ºber Stunden hinweg. Gute Aufl√∂sung beim Sound, das gibt's auch nicht bei billigen!; Sennheiser Over-ear, closed back, lightweight, above average sound quality, neutral sound.
Under ¬£60 what's not to like?

Five-star rating for exceeding all expectations at this price point.; Saves me from using my monitors when using my synthesizers in my studio, they are great when used with a mixing console, great for music production. Read the manual if you are thinking about using these headphones for listening to music on your mobile phone or any other portabe device it tells you not to do it!!!!!!!!!!"

We make that happen for you with Tru Bass, Tru Balance and Tru Rock.; 10mm Driver:- Dive into the world of balanced audio quality.; ENC for superior calling:- Experience a clear calling experience when you talk on the phone with Environmental Noise Cancellation.; Low Latency (up to 50ms):- Gaming, talking or listening to music - it‚Äôs a lag-free zone with up to 50ms of low latency.; Sporty elegant design:- Designed for flexibility and comfort, making your audio experience look as great","The FIRST and primary features is the microphone. The other person in line can hear my voice crystal clear and without any background noise. (Most of the bluetooth headphones have unpleasant background noise and with the person on the other end not hearing us properly )

SECONDLY, the battery back up is incredible. It can last a day with frequent use and lose only about 10%-20% of the total capacity.

THIRDLY, the buttons are placed distinctly and protruding, which makes it very convenient. (Yes flat buttons are confusing and we tend to press the wrong ones)

FOURTH point is that the bass quality is pretty good.
Other advantages includes good quality plastic and wire material, even the ear plugs are soft and comfortable. The magnet also works well and the bluetooth doesn't get disconnected even when they gets attached. (some bluetooth gets disconnected when the magnet gets attached or kept un used for a while, which i find it very inconvenient)

The ONLY DISADVANTAGE i find is that even the lowest volume is loud for me, especially while using it at night or when your surrounding is calm.; I actually purchased this product as I was tight on budget. I searched for a lot of neckbands and bought this. Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
1. The build quality and look of the neckband feels premium and durable compared to Mivi collar 2

2. Sound quality is quite good..it gets loud enough but not too loud. Bass is on point and overall you get a very well balanced sound quality.

3. The battery life is simply amazing. It lasts for about 3 days and my usage is 3-4 hours per day.

4. It has a Qualcomm chipset which is okayish for this price point. Noice cancellation is also average.

5. It supports dual pairing- this means that you can connect upto 2 devices with this neckband and the audio switches automatically as you go from one device to another (however I noticed a delay of 2-3 seconds).

6. Mic quality is good enough. The other person can hear clearly.

Cons:

1. You do not get AptX or AptX HD. For those who don‚Äôt know these are Bluetooth audio codecs. You can google it out and see which audio codecs does your phone support. If you are an iPhone user like me then you can use this as iPhone only supports AAC codec.

2. You do not get a thumping bass. So for bass lovers I do not recommend this. If you like a more balanced and crisp sound then go for it.

3. Latency - as it does not have AptX HD so it has latency while gaming compared to Boat rockerz 335 and OnePlus wireless buds (YouTube, prime, netflix works fine)

4. It has micro usb port. This product was launched in 2020 but still has a micro usb port instead of a type C.

5. There is a hissing sound continuously on this and boat rockerz which I did not notice on mivi collar 2

Conclusion: Well if the pros and cons did not help you out then here are my final thoughts on this. If you are someone who likes to listen to a lot of music and not overwhelming bass then this product is really good. The battery life is great you get atleast 10 hours of battery on 80-90% volume. It‚Äôs not for gaming so don‚Äôt buy it just for gaming purpose.; Nice product, Batery life is also good & sound quality is marvellous; I have to change my mind its worthless stopped working in a usage of short duration, i request that kindly ignore below conclusion, its useless don't go with it

In this Review i will be covering good and bad aspect and how genuinely it seems to me at first sight, it depends on insight and experiences and gives you general idea about whether you should purchase it or not, following points given below:-

Prosüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

Delivery:-i am restless kid who don't believe in waiting, trust me Amazon,s key point that will never disappoint and never want you to wait so long. The only exception is that when order reaches from other city then it takes 4 to 5 days, which as per the usual process considerable

Box Content:- it comes with noise registration leaflet, manual, micro usb cable, extra pair of earbuds

Connectivity:-Its perfect but lags somehow, its hard to proceed far away. Mainly it depends on obstacles how it works.

Battery:- i haven't charged it since the day product arrived and with mixed usage, battery level not yet reduced despite of mixed and moderate use. And still manage to be at 80%.

Sound quality:-
Considering the price point, audio is just perfectly balanced the good point is its a blend of perfect tuning. Seperation of instruments and vocal can be easily identified. In short music lovers will start loving it, apart from that extra bass is just gimmick. Else its brilliant and produce best sound, songs feels bit low and average in normal mode but when turn to extra bass mode then the sound accompanied by bass. In short its sound and audio is just perfect for what is right, balanced thats what made it so different. Trust me i was skeptical and i returned 6 to 7 earphones and headphones just because they have not met my expectations but it stands on my expectations, brilliant work.

Cons:-üëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

Bass:-üòî
To remind that functional button is there change the mode from normal to extra bass, its just a gimmick and need a thoughtful touch before introducing it.it doesn't work that way they condemn it.

Build quality:- no doubt its perfect, but its earbuds are quite old fashioned, design is just overtly laid which were downside and i don't like that much.

Noise cancellation:- There is no reduction of noise however its one bad aspect considering the price points

Ear buds:- Doesn't fit well in my ears, its not that they came but it seems to be loosened and noise could have given in ear design,metal housing is not there, and earbuds were overtly designed, its modern trend to have in ear design which fits perfect and it lacks these qualitiesüòî

Conclusionüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

bought these neckband although this could be premium and stay around for a while, to say its premium and classy but can't beat boat rockers 255 in terms of bass. Apart from bass its perfect comparing to boat rockers, dont know about the durability, At first glance these neckbands are show stealers. Trust me sound quality is what you need then you may go for it, considering its bad aspect you may also prefer to ignore; This neckband is good for general use, if you lookinh for bass‚Äî don't buy it.
however sound quality is pretty good in terms of clear audio. But Music Lovers, it's not for you.

Magnetic Tips are just to keep it together, it doesn't have any function!
When you connect tips ‚Äî
‚Ä¢ it doesn't pause your music
‚Ä¢ it doesn't Disconnect your BT.

i found BOAT ROCKERZ much better purchase in terms for functionality and music.

And there is no RETURN POLICY. so purchase it wisely.; Really appreciate your product for it's good quality sound, unique design and great looks. Keep going. Thank you."

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

I recently had the opportunity to try out a pair of earbuds that have genuinely enhanced my listening experience. These earbuds have impressed me with their sound quality, comfort, and overall performance. Allow me to share my detailed review.

First and foremost, the sound quality delivered by these earbuds is exceptional. The audio is clear, balanced, and immersive, allowing me to truly appreciate the nuances in my favorite music. The bass is rich and punchy, while the midrange and treble frequencies are well-defined and crisp. Whether I'm listening to classical melodies or energetic rock tunes, these earbuds consistently deliver an enjoyable audio experience.

Comfort is another aspect where these earbuds shine. They come with a variety of ear tip sizes, ensuring a secure and comfortable fit for different ear shapes. The lightweight design and ergonomic shape make them easy to wear for extended periods without causing discomfort or fatigue. I appreciate that they stay securely in place, even during workouts or active movements.

The battery life of these earbuds is commendable as well. They provide a substantial playtime on a single charge, allowing for uninterrupted listening throughout the day. The charging case is compact and portable, making it convenient to carry and ensuring that the earbuds are always ready to use.

One feature I particularly appreciate is the seamless Bluetooth connectivity. Pairing the earbuds with my devices was effortless, and the connection remained stable without any dropouts. The wireless range is impressive, allowing me to move around without being tethered to my device. Additionally, the earbuds feature intuitive touch controls, allowing easy access to play/pause, volume adjustment, and call management.

While the overall performance of these earbuds is exceptional, I did encounter a minor drawback. The noise isolation could be improved, especially in louder environments. Although they provide some passive noise reduction, ambient sounds can still be heard, which may affect the immersion in certain situations.

In conclusion, these earbuds have impressed me with their superior sound quality, comfort, and convenient features. They offer an immersive listening experience, and their long battery life ensures uninterrupted enjoyment. Despite a minor limitation in noise isolation, these earbuds are a reliable choice for music enthusiasts and individuals seeking a wireless audio solution. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality pair of earbuds.; Earbuds looks good and sound quality was nice. Charge stays for long time. But the problem is no notification sound for incoming calls if you're listening songs and receive call it'll turn into silent, if you aren't listening to song you don't know the call since it'll be silent. Another issue which I faced while driving with helmet receiver can't hear us. But noise cancelation is superb while driving without helmet receivers can clearly able to listen us.; The Boult Audio Z40 Pro is a solid choice for those looking for an affordable yet feature-packed pair of earphones. Here are some of its standout features:

1. Sound Quality: The Z40 Pro offers immersive sound quality with deep bass and crisp highs, allowing you to enjoy your music, movies, and games with clarity.

2. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): This feature helps block out ambient noise, allowing you to focus on your audio experience without distractions from the outside world.

3. Comfortable Fit: The earphones come with different-sized ear tips to ensure a comfortable and secure fit for extended listening sessions.

4. Battery Life: With a long battery life, you can enjoy hours of uninterrupted listening on a single charge.

5. Built-in Mic: The Z40 Pro features a built-in microphone for hands-free calling and voice assistant support, making it convenient for on-the-go use.

6. Durable Design: The earphones are built to last with sturdy construction, making them suitable for everyday use.

7. Bluetooth Connectivity: With Bluetooth connectivity, you can easily pair the earphones with your smartphone, tablet, or other Bluetooth-enabled devices, providing wireless freedom.

Overall, the Boult Audio Z40 Pro offers a compelling combination of performance, features, and affordability, making it a great choice for anyone in the market for a new pair of earphones.; Not so worth of money bcz of audio quality but it's good not so bad
We can listen it's audio even not wearing buds if we put buds at a certain distance the audio is audible outside
Pls don't buy its cover together that is very poor"

May be will go with other ones of skullcandy, but no other brand for sure .... :-)

Previous comment=====================
Hi,
I am writing this after extensive use of this product after 3 days...
Amazon sells what it shows... I am very happy with this product..
Search of new earphone was ON when I happened to check one of my friend's On ear headphone of skullcandy.
I heard so clear sound that i became fan of skullcandy than and there.. and i decided to order one for me.. but i wanted In-ear headphone..
So search started, checked few others which were with my friends, like HOM, senheisser , JBL, but dont know why i didnt liked them over skullcandy.. although they are also good quality...
So finally ordered this one and i was Relieved that no negative review became true for me... hahaha...
Quality wise, it's definitely not bad considering its Made in USA, could have been better considering rough usage for headphones in India.. but if someone takes good care of good product, it may last for years.... it all depends on how you handle or respect your product...
Sound - Great combination of noise cancellation and amazing output, which gives crystal clear sound and you can literary listen every beats of music... and even those songs which i used to skip, i listened them too, because this product gives a different taste to it and forces you to keep on listening.
Mic - is good and is without phone pick up button. But its ok, only issue comes when driving and phone rings.
Final words - This product is for music lovers... Thank you Amazon for giving me this amazing experience of music.
Great product, and highly recommended... :-); Nice; Sound, bass, clarity, durability all are perfect value for money; The sound quality is extremely poor and I doubt its original or not. There is noway to return as well, so DON'T BUY THIS CRAP!! It's a TRAP!!; Affordable and quality wise good one; Sound quality good. For me it's useful for teams meeting. Worth for money. The symbol is crazy ü§™. I just love it; I have used exactly for 2 years.
After 2 years suddenly right side of the ear phone stopped working. It has no warranty so I can't replace it. Otherwise sound quality is good. Mic quality is also good. Now there are many other options available like JBL or BOAT or Sennheiser, so I think go for that as they available in same price.; Better than some other brands; Calidad del sonido muy buena cuando los pones adecuadamente, aisla el sonido, cable largo, muy buenos y excelente marca por ese precio; bad; Tutto sommato di buona qualit√†, audio discreto soprattutto in relazione al costo.. il tastino un p√≤ rumoroso ma pratico; Qualidade do som; Kwaliteit lijkt prima

Geluidskwaliteit is best goed."

Loudness: 5/5
No distortion even at higher volumes. Negligible distortion at 100%

Clarity: 4/5
No issue is there but the crispness could have been more.

Highs: 4/5
Mids: 4.5/5
Lows: 4.5/5

Comfort: 5/5
Fits perfectly. No issue even after using continuously for 5 hours.

Touch response: 4.5/5
There are minor lags in touch response which take some getting used to. Also you can't sleep with these on. The buds register ghost touches when it touches the pillow.

Bass: 4.5/5
Punchy enough, not blunt. But could have been more pronounced

Instrument seperation: 4.2/5
A regular user won't feel any issue, but as a audiophile the instrument seperation needs improvement. A better audio codec is required for a richer sound experience. But cannot complain in this price bracket. No tws in 1k price gives satisfactory instrument seperation.

Battery: 5/5
Buds last over 5 hours at around 60% volume.

Connectivity: 4.5/5
In the same room there is no issue in connectivity. In the next room, there are some rare minor hiccups. When you go two rooms across then there are some lags

Calling and Mic: 4.7/5
In indoor condition, superb experience. But when you are in a crowded street with too much honking or near a waterfall or windy area then you can hear clearly but the person on the other side can hear noise. Nothing to complain.

All over performance: 4.5/5
There are some areas for improvement, but this is a bang for bucks. The case is small and matte finish looks good. Comfortable buds. Sound quality is good. Call quality is good. If you want an affordable TWS you can definitely go for it. Its only competetor is truke, with better call quality. But the music and vocal quality on Noise Buds N1 is best under 1k.; I've been using the Noise Buds N1 for a few hours like 5-6 hours now, and overall, they are decent wireless earbuds. The sound quality is satisfactory with clear highs and mids, though the bass could be more pronounced. They fit comfortably in the ears and are lightweight, making them easy to wear for extended periods.

The battery life is good, providing around 4-5 hours of playback on a single charge, with the case offering additional recharges. The Bluetooth connectivity is stable, and pairing is straightforward. However, the touch controls can be a bit finicky and take some getting used to.

For the price, the Noise BUDS N1 offers good value, especially for casual listeners who want an affordable, reliable pair of earbuds. They're not perfect, but they get the job done for everyday use.; I recently purchased the Earbuds N1 and overall, I am quite satisfied with my experience. Here are my thoughts:

**Sound Quality:** The sound quality is decent, providing clear and balanced audio. Whether it's for music, calls, or podcasts, the earbuds perform well across various audio formats.

**Fit:** The fit of the earbuds is also good. They are comfortable to wear for extended periods without causing any discomfort, making them ideal for daily use.

**Connectivity:** One of the standout features is the fast connectivity. Pairing the earbuds with devices is quick and seamless, ensuring a hassle-free experience.

**Build Quality:** The only downside I found is the build quality of the case. It could be improved to match the overall quality of the earbuds themselves. The case feels a bit flimsy and could use a more robust construction.

**Conclusion:** Despite the minor issue with the case, the Earbuds N1 are a great choice with good sound quality, comfortable fit, fast connectivity, and a useful gaming mode. I would recommend them to anyone looking for reliable and affordable earbuds.; Advantages - very compact design, nice colour , build quality of specially buds is good , volume level is very high , sound quality is decent
Disadvantage - build quality of case is poor , the lead of the case is very unstable and feels cheap

My personal experience- I recied this product with broken seal , the lead of the case is very problematic; What I like about Noise Buds N1 is everything that I needed in earbuds it has provided like matfinish and strong build quality, i like the colour of this product so much, coming to the most important part the performance of the product so far I love the sound quality of the product and one can hear the bass of the audio very well; Audio is clear, mic quality is super,size are small, fast charging and easily to connect the mobile; Good quality, ease of use and high music audio with enough battery life; I have been using noise VS104 max for quite some time. And now this noise N1.
Noise always provides value for money product. The sound and bass quality is up to mark for this price. Although the microphone needs a bit improvement."

Voy a comenzar aclarando que el pedido llego justo el d√≠a de hoy as√≠ que mis impresiones son muy tempranas, as√≠ que puede que me este dejando llevar un poco por la emoci√≥n.

La verdad es que estoy impresionado, en cuanto los sacas de su empaque el producto se ve de muy buena apariencia, algo ligeros pero nada que asuste. Las almohadillas son muy c√≥modas, el colch√≥n de la diadema es justo, no es incre√≠ble, pero es bastante c√≥modo, hay muchos productos de este precio que no tienen ni eso.
Los cables auxiliares que vienen con los aud√≠fonos son buenos, decentes al menos. Tambi√©n vienen con una bolsita para cargar los aud√≠fonos, que tampoco es la gran cosa, pero es un buen agregado.

En cuanto al sonido, la verdad es que son excelentes. No poseo aud√≠fonos de alta gama, pero si he probado varios aud√≠fonos en mi trabajo (Soy editor de video en un estudio de mi ciudad) y la verdad es que como primer impresi√≥n, no me parece que le pidan mucho a modelos como los Audio-Technica M20X.

Si bien no son aud√≠fonos que se recomiendan para producci√≥n o monitoreo de audio, sinceramente creo que tienen un poco de ambos mundos, la respuesta de audio parece ser lo suficientemente buena como para edici√≥n de video o audio sencilla, as√≠ como para uso de entretenimiento. Los bajos no son abrumadores como lo ser√≠an en unos Beats, hay muy buen espaciado entre los sonidos de la m√∫sica, la voz es clara y el aislamiento pasivo es muy bueno.

Veo porque muchos se ir√≠an por unos aud√≠fonos como los ath-m20x u otras opciones de la misma gama, pero la verdad es que creo que como aud√≠fonos de d√≠a a d√≠a me parecen mejor opci√≥n, m√°s c√≥modos e incluso m√°s lindos a la vista... Con el extra de que su respuesta es lo suficientemente buena como para trabajar de forma un poco m√°s profesional."

I had purchased to overcome the cable management with my laptops, smartphones and iPad. Individual charging is good with the recommended 100W cable from the same brand.

Sometimes for laptop itself showing to use the adapter which comes with laptop (65W).

Now trying to charge my S22 Ultra and iPhone 12 Pro max, the one another reject to charge and device force to remove the cable. Disappointed

Only one device u can charge at a time. Waste of money.

Recommendation: Definitely, No; Perfect replacement for my broken oneplus charger. I can say way better. Amazing purchase in this price range. Loved the tiny and compact shape."

I haven't heard this good quality in any of the headphones in this price range. Powerful bass which stands out and doesn't muffle up other frequencies.. thanks to the quality 13mm drivers.

All in All I'm impressed and hoping to use them for atleast a year as it's sturdy and looks good and gives extra comfort; Worst experience with this earphones is about gaming. It produces sounds with 1st 1sec input missing. You could guess how that can affect your gaming. Otherwise it produces decent sound in case of bass and treble and vocals too. If u want this for just entertainment go for it, never for gaming"

Clearly Nirvana sounded way better to me and my daughter and more comfortable than the 20i.

Actually I was so impressed with it - sound quality, looks and comfort fit - that I wanted to have one for myself; but when ordering I ordered the 20i instead seeing all the fabulous reviews. Though the 20i is definitely a good product by itself - but between Nirvana and 20i - to the two of us, Nirvana wins almost all rounds - sound quality, comfort, looks and battery backup( this I am quoting from their claimed data).

Only one area though which I found 20i to be much better at was the call quality - I was simply surprised at the clarity. Nirvana has workable call quality - while 20i is great. This though was indoor call quality.

Overall we liked Nirvanaa way better than 20i.

In short if I have to buy another pair now at this price range, I will choose Nirvana over 20i.; Pros:
1. Beautiful sound quality
2. Crystal clear beats and bass
3. Good Battery life
4. Excellent multiple device connectivity

Cons
1. Cushion is decent like extremely soft, thus it feels weird
2. Plastic used is very cheap. It broke withing months.
3. Supplied cables are not long lasting.

Overall functionality is up to the mark, yet build quality is argumentative.; ; The sound quality is great but the build quality is worst.
In just 1 year decent use the plastic headband has broken in 3 different parts. I am using feviquick to keep it intact. If someone had used it roughly then cant imagine how early this would have been brojen.

Spending such an amount & getting such bad build quality has pushed me from buying Boat products from now.; 1st. Durability is too good
2nd. The sound is amazing and the bass is very heavy
3rd. And the ANC is amazing when you turn on the ANC mode the background noice will decreased by 75%
4th. The best Headphone at this budget you should definitely buy this Headphone.
> Thank you; Mic quality is not so good , have to speak loudly otherwise recever didn't listen and sound is good but not best in this price range . It feels little heavy. design is best in this price range and connectivity is good; 1. Sound stage is little base heavy
2. Mic is only usable on call if you are in a quiet room..AC,Fans/Cooler noise disrupt the call quality very much.It sounds like your voice is coming from far away.
3. It only charges via the type-c cable given in the box for some reasons.
4. Not for gaming-too much latency in Bluetooth mode. Use cable if you want to play.
5. Built quality is good but squeaking sound will be there when you wear it {sometimes}.
6. Noice cancellation is okay ..prevents static noice of cooler or AC from getting in but don't buy only for ANC.
7. No app support
8. Overall value of money product but not the best.; I bought it on 24th July 2023. Today 11th August 2023 still i didn't get any disappointment with this product.
While (BGMI)gaming It's difficult to find latency via Bluetooth connection. But wired connection is good for gaming.
No need of charge is required for wired connection. But Wired connection is not supporting ANC feature. Easily find the noise difference with ANC & Ambient & ANC off modes.
On ear it is very comfortable it covers Your ear fully. Also Feels Little bit weight & it causes neck pain at the beginning stage of usage but fews days later it's fine. Worthy product to adjust the pain.

Edited after 7 months of usage :
If you're crazy about gaming this wasn't good option. There is no latency issue that can be easily found. But enemy foot sounds are very important in games. This model is made for music. Not for gaming."

They were a reluctant replacement for my existing pair back then which had broken down. I never believed that these would be anywhere near par with those but boy, was I wrong.
I always go for wired earphones because of my own reasons. The main of which are the sound quality and the overall performance of the earphones across the entire spectrum of sound. To buy a pair with a similar performance as these in bluetooth earphones you could easily have to shell out as much as ten thousand bucks. The main antagonist of wired earphones which is entanglement of the wires never bothers me much so I usually don't have much of a problem.
To compare it with the other earphones in the wired category of the same range, these are hands down miles ahead of any competitor. They may be a hundred odd bucks expensive from its competitors but the overall value derived from these far outweighs that amount. The manufacturers now a days very shrewdly give features in their earphones which allow them to play bass very well which gives an impression that they are indeed fabulous on an ordinary hearing. But if you continue to test them on different parameters of sound performance you soon realize that its a deliberate marketing ploy deployed by the manufacturers to fool you into believing that their earphones are far superior than their price tag. These kinds of earphones usually fall flat on every other parameter. Their performance at high volumes become undesirable and sound phony to the ear. The noise is shrill at higher notes and the sound never is tempered across the entire frequency range except maybe when the bass kicks in. However, you won't find any such jarring problems in these earphones. Sony has been in the music business for long and they know how to provide quality to their customers and know that their customers demand quality from them. They don't disappoint with this product. I may be wrong but I can go out on a limb and say that these are probably the best earphones you may find till the fifteen hundred price range. The other, mainly Chinese, competitors are out to hoodwink their customers into buying their products by tempting price tags and superficially apparent features but you can easily give them a pass in favour of this pair.
TL,DR - These might be the best earphones in this price range and even amongst ones in a level higher range. Don't fret and buy this product assuredly.; Good; It provides good passive noise cancellation. Good for listening music. But call quality needs to be improved; Product mic not working within one month that also used 3 to 4 times..

CONS
1. the mic is average and the voice feels a little modulated on the mic provided .
2. the case is little bulky due to longer battery life but you will get used to it in about 2 to 3 days. The case quality is decent but the case lid feels like its built out of crappy plastic and doesnt feel robust or stable in hand.
3. these airdopes are based on bluetooth v 5.0 and later and they will work great with all the devices having the same bluetooth version i.e v5.0 or newer however in case of older versions there is a lot of latency lag. I personally use these with my laptop that has v5.0 and they work great however when i connect them with my android phone which has bluetooth v 4.10 , the experience is horrendous ... there are many problems like latency lag, voice breaks etc even when the bt v.50 is backwards compatible .... i experience this latency lag and voice break during calling , whatsapp calling and playing simple mobile games. Despite all this there is no problem while streaming songs on these airdopes.
4. there is a lot of voice leakage if you use them on 100 percent volume both on laptop and mobile phones you will have to tweak them ... the voice is also kind of high so you will not be able to listen to anything on 100 percent anyhow .... 50 to 60 is an ideal level for all the movies and games as well as music.
5. Your ears will hurt after prolonged usage of these if you dont select the right size of air caps ... 3 sizes are already provided inside the box.
6. The biggest con while using these airdopes on windows is that you cannot use the airdopes and the inbuilt mic together .... windows doesnt allow it even if you try very hard to use both the mic and airdopes output speaker together Its a windows issue but is manageable .
7.Another big problem is that the voice control option is absent on the airdopes and the volume cant be controlled from the airdopes ... you will have to control it from the device which is also a big problem .

PROS-
1. the sound quality and the bass are great .
2. the battery life is great you can easily use them for 7 to 8 hours on continuous usage.
3. They charge very quickly, in a jiffy.
4. They feel even greater if you enable surround sound while using them on windows platform.
5. the connectivity is great too ;as soon as you open the case they will automatically detect and connect to the available devices that you paired them with earlier within seconds.
6. There is literally zero latency and zero lag on these while connected on the same bluetooth version .... i used these on my laptop and played all the games like cs go, valorant, gta 5, and other games but there is no issue while gaming or music.
7.There is a support for mono audio and you can use one airdope at a time instead of using both.
8.Boat has provided a year's warranty on these so they can be easily replaced in case of a damage if the damage occurs within the given time frame .

Overall the product can be optimized a bit more but is still good to use now and is a decent purchase on this price point ; however better options are available if you intend to use it just for calling purpose , better go with something wired or something that comes with older bt versions if you intend to use them with devices with older bluetooth versions ."

For me, these truly wireless earbuds (TWS) have changed everything. No more juggling tangled cables or having trouble moving around. Whether I'm at the gym, driving, or just lounging around the house, they're ideal for listening to music on the go. What I adore most about them is this: * Crystal-clear sound: The sound is incredibly clear, with deep bass and sharp highs. * Snug and pleasant fit: A variety of ear tips sizes are included to provide a secure and comfortable fit that holds throughout movement. * Long battery life: With additional charges from the charging case, I can listen for hours on a single charge. Easy-to-use touch controls are available for playback, volume, and calling on the earphones.
These are really impressive wireless earbuds. They're an excellent choice for anyone seeking a high-end, fashionable, and practical listening experience. The following are some other items you may want to include in your review: * The particular brand and type of your earbuds * The pricing * The call quality * The noise-canceling capabilities (if applicable) * The price I hope this is useful.; Been using this for about 2 months. For ‚Çπ999, it's a really good product.
They connect fastly and has a good audio quality, bass too. Tuch gestures work really well. Both the case and the buds are lightweight so it's good to carry along. Different sizes and colored earpieces are provided, which I would say is great. Charging cable is also of good quality, though it's short.

Connectivity ranges to like 2 rooms in house and about 6-8 hours of playback, so it's not bad. Though the build quality is little poor as one of the earbud's piece came off from a fall. It wasn't broken, was able to join it back and worked well.

Good earbuds; This earbuds gives good sound quality. The design is also good. Bluetooth range is not that good. Battery life is excellent. Overall a seamless listening experience. It gives a outstanding performance and value. I got it just for 799/-. A good deal indeed.; The quality of the product is good but the only thing I don't like which is it does not fix properly in our ear and often got fallen from my ear. Otherwise the quality and sound quality is good; This airbuds is the best buds in the price range... I'm use hardly and enjoyed very much. I don't say that this is the best but ‚Çπ799 it's a good option. It's built quality is very impressive and sound quality decent... And performance avarage because this is not a gameing buds
I'm impressed; First purchase of a noise producr. I got this for 799. It's a steal. Great packaging and attention to details inside the box.
Coming to the product, well it's too good for the price but definitely not the best for all music genres. Tonal quality is preserved and it doesnt even need to be above 40 to 50% volume. Ergonomics could be a challenge for some. Doesn't absolutely snug in the ear without paining
Play around with the eq to get the most out of it
It is hands down better than any at this price range. Highly recommend; Good for listening music as well as for calling, clear audio, better battery life, easy charging, easy to carry.; Usage:
Regularly used for calls and watching videos.

Likes:
Attractive design and serves its purpose well. Offers good value for its price point.

Dislikes:
Fragile casing design; disassembled after a single drop. Lack of noise cancellation, which was unexpected and disappointing.

Conclusion:
These earbuds are functional for calls and video watching, with a pleasing design and reasonable price. However, durability issues and the absence of expected noise cancellation detract from the overall experience."

The other person in line can hear my voice crystal clear and without any background noise. (Most of the bluetooth headphones have unpleasant background noise and with the person on the other end not hearing us properly )

SECONDLY, the battery back up is incredible. It can last a day with frequent use and lose only about 10%-20% of the total capacity.

THIRDLY, the buttons are placed distinctly and protruding, which makes it very convenient. (Yes flat buttons are confusing and we tend to press the wrong ones)

FOURTH point is that the bass quality is pretty good.
Other advantages includes good quality plastic and wire material, even the ear plugs are soft and comfortable. The magnet also works well and the bluetooth doesn't get disconnected even when they gets attached. (some bluetooth gets disconnected when the magnet gets attached or kept un used for a while, which i find it very inconvenient)

The ONLY DISADVANTAGE i find is that even the lowest volume is loud for me, especially while using it at night or when your surrounding is calm.; I actually purchased this product as I was tight on budget. I searched for a lot of neckbands and bought this. Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
1. The build quality and look of the neckband feels premium and durable compared to Mivi collar 2

2. Sound quality is quite good..it gets loud enough but not too loud. Bass is on point and overall you get a very well balanced sound quality.

3. The battery life is simply amazing. It lasts for about 3 days and my usage is 3-4 hours per day.

4. It has a Qualcomm chipset which is okayish for this price point. Noice cancellation is also average.

5. It supports dual pairing- this means that you can connect upto 2 devices with this neckband and the audio switches automatically as you go from one device to another (however I noticed a delay of 2-3 seconds).

6. Mic quality is good enough. The other person can hear clearly.

Cons:

1. You do not get AptX or AptX HD. For those who don‚Äôt know these are Bluetooth audio codecs. You can google it out and see which audio codecs does your phone support. If you are an iPhone user like me then you can use this as iPhone only supports AAC codec.

2. You do not get a thumping bass. So for bass lovers I do not recommend this. If you like a more balanced and crisp sound then go for it.

3. Latency - as it does not have AptX HD so it has latency while gaming compared to Boat rockerz 335 and OnePlus wireless buds (YouTube, prime, netflix works fine)

4. It has micro usb port. This product was launched in 2020 but still has a micro usb port instead of a type C.

5. There is a hissing sound continuously on this and boat rockerz which I did not notice on mivi collar 2

Conclusion: Well if the pros and cons did not help you out then here are my final thoughts on this. If you are someone who likes to listen to a lot of music and not overwhelming bass then this product is really good. The battery life is great you get atleast 10 hours of battery on 80-90% volume. It‚Äôs not for gaming so don‚Äôt buy it just for gaming purpose.; Nice product, Batery life is also good & sound quality is marvellous; I have to change my mind its worthless stopped working in a usage of short duration, i request that kindly ignore below conclusion, its useless don't go with it

In this Review i will be covering good and bad aspect and how genuinely it seems to me at first sight, it depends on insight and experiences and gives you general idea about whether you should purchase it or not, following points given below:-

Prosüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

Delivery:-i am restless kid who don't believe in waiting, trust me Amazon,s key point that will never disappoint and never want you to wait so long. The only exception is that when order reaches from other city then it takes 4 to 5 days, which as per the usual process considerable

Box Content:- it comes with noise registration leaflet, manual, micro usb cable, extra pair of earbuds

Connectivity:-Its perfect but lags somehow, its hard to proceed far away. Mainly it depends on obstacles how it works.

Battery:- i haven't charged it since the day product arrived and with mixed usage, battery level not yet reduced despite of mixed and moderate use. And still manage to be at 80%.

Sound quality:-
Considering the price point, audio is just perfectly balanced the good point is its a blend of perfect tuning. Seperation of instruments and vocal can be easily identified. In short music lovers will start loving it, apart from that extra bass is just gimmick. Else its brilliant and produce best sound, songs feels bit low and average in normal mode but when turn to extra bass mode then the sound accompanied by bass. In short its sound and audio is just perfect for what is right, balanced thats what made it so different. Trust me i was skeptical and i returned 6 to 7 earphones and headphones just because they have not met my expectations but it stands on my expectations, brilliant work.

Cons:-üëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

Bass:-üòî
To remind that functional button is there change the mode from normal to extra bass, its just a gimmick and need a thoughtful touch before introducing it.it doesn't work that way they condemn it.

Build quality:- no doubt its perfect, but its earbuds are quite old fashioned, design is just overtly laid which were downside and i don't like that much.

Noise cancellation:- There is no reduction of noise however its one bad aspect considering the price points

Ear buds:- Doesn't fit well in my ears, its not that they came but it seems to be loosened and noise could have given in ear design,metal housing is not there, and earbuds were overtly designed, its modern trend to have in ear design which fits perfect and it lacks these qualitiesüòî

Conclusionüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

bought these neckband although this could be premium and stay around for a while, to say its premium and classy but can't beat boat rockers 255 in terms of bass. Apart from bass its perfect comparing to boat rockers, dont know about the durability, At first glance these neckbands are show stealers. Trust me sound quality is what you need then you may go for it, considering its bad aspect you may also prefer to ignore; This neckband is good for general use, if you lookinh for bass‚Äî don't buy it.
however sound quality is pretty good in terms of clear audio. But Music Lovers, it's not for you.

Magnetic Tips are just to keep it together, it doesn't have any function!
When you connect tips ‚Äî
‚Ä¢ it doesn't pause your music
‚Ä¢ it doesn't Disconnect your BT.

i found BOAT ROCKERZ much better purchase in terms for functionality and music.

And there is no RETURN POLICY. so purchase it wisely.; Really appreciate your product for it's good quality sound, unique design and great looks. Keep going. Thank you."

This product is one in which I have a lot to say!

Used for 6 days.

To start, I would first start with the that this is a fantastic value product. At Rs 700 it is pretty much a steal.

Coming to sound quality.
It is simply overloaded with bass. Just like those bass guitars. This feels like I'm listening to one good wired headset. If you're a bass lover, this is just for you!
But on the other side of the coin. It's just bass, minute background instrumental sounds are simply lost by the bass! The vocals are also slightly affected by the overpowering bass. Definitely not seen on bluetooth earphones. If you don't have any Equalizer like Dolby or something, wouldn't recommend this for you. Because trebles are weak, mid tones & high tones too!
On the positive note tweaking on the equalizer by reducing the intensity of Low/bass. It works fantastic. The clarity is fantastic after some tweaking. You get great vocals, good mid level tones and balancing lows/ bass. Very good dynamic range (at this price).

Battery:
It's simply fantastic, nothing else to say. Using it since 3-4 days, still at 80%. Will check and update how it works when at 30% level. After 30% you get low battery msg after every 30 seconds. But don't bother as all new earphones have this feature.

Ergonomics:
This is one place, that is seriously BAD. The earbuds do not stay in the ear, not matter which size you pick! It will always pop out. Very annoying, can't listen to music or videos without pushing the earphones inside. Even the earphones are slippery.
The power & volume controls are on the inside side (Why?!) . Very difficult to adjust or pause music using earphone controls. Seriously how can anybody be so Bad?! People should really work on product design and prioritize comfort to the end user. But can't complain at this price point!

Call Quality:
Update: Works great, clear audio to both the speaker and the listener. Initially it was bad but after 5-6 days of usage it works perfectly!

The double pairing feature works as advertised, can be connected to laptop and mobile simultaneously like bigger bluetooth headphones.

Colour & design is good, but functionality matters more.

If this review helps, kindly hit the helpful button so that others can see this too!

Ps: Will update this review after 2-3 months.

~Quality Controller

Great delivery and service by Appario, Amazon.; Wow product. I have been using it for a month or soo n I have used it for 10 days in a go without charging with upto 7 8 hrs use per day. It actually meet its 160 hrs playback time commitment. Highly recommended although it's quality is little bit low due to all plastic part and looks not soo classic. But if U want to go for playback time. It gives U unimaginable results.; Bass is average and sound Quality is Cristal clear , battery backup is amazing as company says it be.; After using this product for 5-6 months I am facing the following problems:
1. Sound quality is not good.
2. Volume adjustment is not adequate. After keeping a low volume output of the volume always feels high.
3. Battery backup is not good. After reaching 60% of charge it always powered off within a very short time (5-10 minutes).
I am very strange that the earphone belongs to such a reputed brand of Zebronic.; The product functions well. Its feature of dual pairing is seamless and beneficial. But due to its large size it creates a problem. The Classic Earphone problem of lossing audio in one or both earpieces over time. And it is caused by the tension tear of wires at the base of neckband main body.

Suggestion to Designers:
Please reduce the length of the rigid portion the goes by the back of neck or increase the lenght of wire to earpieces.
This will prevent the wires from frequent turns that over time cause the wires inside to break because of excess tension.; For 7 months it was working fine.

Loudness: 5/5
No distortion even at higher volumes. Negligible distortion at 100%

Clarity: 4/5
No issue is there but the crispness could have been more.

Highs: 4/5
Mids: 4.5/5
Lows: 4.5/5

Comfort: 5/5
Fits perfectly. No issue even after using continuously for 5 hours.

Touch response: 4.5/5
There are minor lags in touch response which take some getting used to. Also you can't sleep with these on. The buds register ghost touches when it touches the pillow.

Bass: 4.5/5
Punchy enough, not blunt. But could have been more pronounced

Instrument seperation: 4.2/5
A regular user won't feel any issue, but as a audiophile the instrument seperation needs improvement. A better audio codec is required for a richer sound experience. But cannot complain in this price bracket. No tws in 1k price gives satisfactory instrument seperation.

Battery: 5/5
Buds last over 5 hours at around 60% volume.

Connectivity: 4.5/5
In the same room there is no issue in connectivity. In the next room, there are some rare minor hiccups. When you go two rooms across then there are some lags

Calling and Mic: 4.7/5
In indoor condition, superb experience. But when you are in a crowded street with too much honking or near a waterfall or windy area then you can hear clearly but the person on the other side can hear noise. Nothing to complain.

All over performance: 4.5/5
There are some areas for improvement, but this is a bang for bucks. The case is small and matte finish looks good. Comfortable buds. Sound quality is good. Call quality is good. If you want an affordable TWS you can definitely go for it. Its only competetor is truke, with better call quality. But the music and vocal quality on Noise Buds N1 is best under 1k.; I've been using the Noise Buds N1 for a few hours like 5-6 hours now, and overall, they are decent wireless earbuds. The sound quality is satisfactory with clear highs and mids, though the bass could be more pronounced. They fit comfortably in the ears and are lightweight, making them easy to wear for extended periods.

The battery life is good, providing around 4-5 hours of playback on a single charge, with the case offering additional recharges. The Bluetooth connectivity is stable, and pairing is straightforward. However, the touch controls can be a bit finicky and take some getting used to.

For the price, the Noise BUDS N1 offers good value, especially for casual listeners who want an affordable, reliable pair of earbuds. They're not perfect, but they get the job done for everyday use.; I recently purchased the Earbuds N1 and overall, I am quite satisfied with my experience. Here are my thoughts:

**Sound Quality:** The sound quality is decent, providing clear and balanced audio. Whether it's for music, calls, or podcasts, the earbuds perform well across various audio formats.

**Fit:** The fit of the earbuds is also good. They are comfortable to wear for extended periods without causing any discomfort, making them ideal for daily use.

**Connectivity:** One of the standout features is the fast connectivity. Pairing the earbuds with devices is quick and seamless, ensuring a hassle-free experience.

**Build Quality:** The only downside I found is the build quality of the case. It could be improved to match the overall quality of the earbuds themselves. The case feels a bit flimsy and could use a more robust construction.

**Conclusion:** Despite the minor issue with the case, the Earbuds N1 are a great choice with good sound quality, comfortable fit, fast connectivity, and a useful gaming mode. I would recommend them to anyone looking for reliable and affordable earbuds.; Advantages - very compact design, nice colour , build quality of specially buds is good , volume level is very high , sound quality is decent
Disadvantage - build quality of case is poor , the lead of the case is very unstable and feels cheap

My personal experience- I recied this product with broken seal , the lead of the case is very problematic; What I like about Noise Buds N1 is everything that I needed in earbuds it has provided like matfinish and strong build quality, i like the colour of this product so much, coming to the most important part the performance of the product so far I love the sound quality of the product and one can hear the bass of the audio very well; Audio is clear, mic quality is super,size are small, fast charging and easily to connect the mobile; Good quality, ease of use and high music audio with enough battery life; I have been using noise VS104 max for quite some time. And now this noise N1.

The product was recieved on 02/12/2023. Been using it the whole day since then. Have to say that it's a very good product and Boult seem to have nailed it this time around.
Pros :
1. Made in India completely and no Chinese intervention.
2. Type C charging port and decent quality of the cable provided.
3. Minimal design and aesthetically pleasing.
4. Easy to carry even in shirt's pocket as the size is very small (image in comparison to a small pen for reference).
5. Paring is a breeze and once done, disconnection (place back in box and close) and reconnection (take out of box) takes only 1 second.
6. Listened to 8k music and the quality was pretty loud and good.
7. Call clarity and mic quality as per the person at the other end was pretty good and ENC seems to be working really well.
8. Charged fully once and used for two full days and still the 35 mah buds batteries had 40-50% juice left (I took calls, played games, listened to music and watched movies the whole 2 days). Recharging from the case took just 15 mins to reach 80%.
9. Charging the case from 70% back to 100% took just 20 mins or so.

Cons :
1. Bit of nitpicking here. But a digital charge indicator in the base would have made it look and feel even better.

For the price, I feel it provides everything it promised and does an excellent job. Would suggest everyone to go on with this one.; Product quality very good. No issue.
Also build quality good.
Sound quality is desent.; I regret the day I made this purchase üòí

Well my instant review you can find at the end of this updated review. Coz iam putting this after using the product for approximately 3 months. So that you guys can know this is an updated one and what‚Äôs the real matter happened. The right ear got stopped working and I raised complaint with the brand regarding the same. But received only an automated response instead of a customer assistance and call back from customer care executives. I really wanted to use this for my classes and now this is not working properly which I really never expected to happen. I received only whats app reply and I had to try and chat again and again to get a real person talk about the issue and to get resolve it. But that part also turned out to be so pathetic that the person took half of my day. Like for explaining the issue again asking them solution. But this wasn‚Äôt as prompt as a normal customer care ppl. After a question I had to wait at least 10 minutes to get a reply and even with several automated messages like are you still there?‚Ä¶ this was literally wasting my time and driving me crazy but I really got pissed off when the reply came even without solving my issue ‚ÄúHope we solved your query how would you rate our service ‚Äú‚Ä¶. Eventhough I have sent my product for inspection and replacement to their address and waited for their updation. Still nothing came so checked with courier tracking. It has got already delivered and they didn‚Äôt yet send an update. So I had to chat again and get them talk. Finally one person came and took a lot of time and told me to mail them proof of delivery. So I fetched the details again from courier party and send the same. Got a reply mail saying your data is updated. Ok fine,Then waited to get updated and still nothing. Then again today I asked them via chat and the same message as in the mail got copied and pasted by the customer care executive like ‚Äú We would like to inform you that we have received your incomplete details on the courier package which we have now updated from our end.

We will keep you posted on further updates.‚Äù

Now you guyz can decide whether to buy and get treated like this. The product didn‚Äôt last long and this is happening when you want to resolve this issue. So my suggestion choose wisely and don‚Äôt waste your money and time.

My Old Review üòè
The design and everything is so handy. It‚Äôs compact in size and cute in look. Till now no issues with the product and didn‚Äôt have any issues with using in multiple devices. Connecting and everything is so prompt and quick. One request is to please do come up with some cute carrying cases as well so that we can hang it on the bags or keychains to slay the look ü´∂üèª; Best ear buds at affordable price with such good quality and battery backup....go for it....loved it; Build quality is very poor, call quality average,
Some times disturbing in music; Boult Z25 buds Sound quality Imazing battery backup Good my budget soo best item; The bass quality is pretty good. The microphone sounds clear. It does take some time to connect to phone. The battery is okayish in this range. Overall it's pretty good if you want something good in between ‚Çπ800-‚Çπ1000. Tho you might wanna reconsider if you have really small ears because they hurt after 30mins of use it's not the fault of the design but personal issues.; Very good üëçüèª , value of money üí∞, good performance, excellent battery, It gets connected the moment it is placed near something,"

Liked the place where buttons configured on the left cup and looks premium. Grey and golden makes it classy. Audio jack included and connects well. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.
Thank you very much,
Your customer Armaan."

The earbuds themselves fit snugly in my ears without causing any discomfort even during extended wear. Whether I'm on a long commute, hitting the gym, or simply lounging at home, the ergonomic design ensures a secure fit and maximum comfort.

Sound Quality: The sound quality of these earphones is outstanding. The bass is deep and rich, while the mids and highs are clear and well-defined. I've found myself rediscovering my favorite songs and hearing details that I never noticed before. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tracks or taking calls, the audio is crisp and immersive, making every moment enjoyable.

Connectivity: Pairing these earphones with my devices has been a breeze. The Bluetooth connectivity is reliable and consistent, allowing me to move around without worrying about wires. The range is impressive too, letting me keep my device in one room while I move around freely.

There is a slight change in voice sometimes (from the other end), the voice comes as robotic, not sure if this happened with anyone else. It doesn't last more than a few secs, can be slightly disturbing, overall so far no complaints. Convenient, battery life is good so far. Did connect easily to the computer too.; I recently purchased the COSTAR Bluetooth headphones, and I am beyond impressed!

Its performance is worth the price Highly recommended!""; I recently got my hands on the Ptron Bassbuds duo, and I must say, they have been quite a pleasant surprise.
As a budget-conscious consumer, I was initially skeptical about their performance, but after putting them to the test, I'm impressed with what they offer for the price.

Sound Quality: The standout feature of the Ptron Bassbuds duo is their audio quality. The bass response is punchy and powerful, as the name suggests. For bass enthusiasts, these earbuds won't disappoint. However, the bass isn't overpowering and still maintains a good balance with the mids and highs. The overall sound signature leans towards warmth, which makes them ideal for genres like pop, hip-hop, and electronic music.

Connectivity: Pairing the Bassbuds duo with my smartphone was effortless, and they maintained a stable connection with minimal dropouts during use.

Loudness: 5/5
No distortion even at higher volumes. Negligible distortion at 100%

Clarity: 4/5
No issue is there but the crispness could have been more.

Highs: 4/5
Mids: 4.5/5
Lows: 4.5/5

Comfort: 5/5
Fits perfectly. No issue even after using continuously for 5 hours.

Touch response: 4.5/5
There are minor lags in touch response which take some getting used to. Also you can't sleep with these on. The buds register ghost touches when it touches the pillow.

Bass: 4.5/5
Punchy enough, not blunt. But could have been more pronounced

Instrument seperation: 4.2/5
A regular user won't feel any issue, but as a audiophile the instrument seperation needs improvement. A better audio codec is required for a richer sound experience. But cannot complain in this price bracket. No tws in 1k price gives satisfactory instrument seperation.

Battery: 5/5
Buds last over 5 hours at around 60% volume.

Connectivity: 4.5/5
In the same room there is no issue in connectivity. In the next room, there are some rare minor hiccups. When you go two rooms across then there are some lags

Calling and Mic: 4.7/5
In indoor condition, superb experience. But when you are in a crowded street with too much honking or near a waterfall or windy area then you can hear clearly but the person on the other side can hear noise. Nothing to complain.

All over performance: 4.5/5
There are some areas for improvement, but this is a bang for bucks. The case is small and matte finish looks good. Comfortable buds. Sound quality is good. Call quality is good. If you want an affordable TWS you can definitely go for it. Its only competetor is truke, with better call quality. But the music and vocal quality on Noise Buds N1 is best under 1k.; I've been using the Noise Buds N1 for a few hours like 5-6 hours now, and overall, they are decent wireless earbuds. The sound quality is satisfactory with clear highs and mids, though the bass could be more pronounced. They fit comfortably in the ears and are lightweight, making them easy to wear for extended periods.

The battery life is good, providing around 4-5 hours of playback on a single charge, with the case offering additional recharges. The Bluetooth connectivity is stable, and pairing is straightforward. However, the touch controls can be a bit finicky and take some getting used to.

For the price, the Noise BUDS N1 offers good value, especially for casual listeners who want an affordable, reliable pair of earbuds. They're not perfect, but they get the job done for everyday use.; I recently purchased the Earbuds N1 and overall, I am quite satisfied with my experience. Here are my thoughts:

**Sound Quality:** The sound quality is decent, providing clear and balanced audio. Whether it's for music, calls, or podcasts, the earbuds perform well across various audio formats.

**Fit:** The fit of the earbuds is also good. They are comfortable to wear for extended periods without causing any discomfort, making them ideal for daily use.

**Connectivity:** One of the standout features is the fast connectivity. Pairing the earbuds with devices is quick and seamless, ensuring a hassle-free experience.

**Build Quality:** The only downside I found is the build quality of the case. It could be improved to match the overall quality of the earbuds themselves. The case feels a bit flimsy and could use a more robust construction.

**Conclusion:** Despite the minor issue with the case, the Earbuds N1 are a great choice with good sound quality, comfortable fit, fast connectivity, and a useful gaming mode. I would recommend them to anyone looking for reliable and affordable earbuds.; Advantages - very compact design, nice colour , build quality of specially buds is good , volume level is very high , sound quality is decent
Disadvantage - build quality of case is poor , the lead of the case is very unstable and feels cheap

My personal experience- I recied this product with broken seal , the lead of the case is very problematic; What I like about Noise Buds N1 is everything that I needed in earbuds it has provided like matfinish and strong build quality, i like the colour of this product so much, coming to the most important part the performance of the product so far I love the sound quality of the product and one can hear the bass of the audio very well; Audio is clear, mic quality is super,size are small, fast charging and easily to connect the mobile; Good quality, ease of use and high music audio with enough battery life; I have been using noise VS104 max for quite some time. And now this noise N1.
Noise always provides value for money product. The sound and bass quality is up to mark for this price. Although the microphone needs a bit improvement."

Sound is superb however the price may be little bit on a higher side.; I have been using these headphones for 4 weeks and this is my review. I needed a good quality wireless headphone to connect to all my devices (Smartphone, Work MacBook & my Gaming PC), so I felt this one will do it.

Sound Quality: It is good for at this price range, has some good bass, I didn't find any problems with it. While gaming also it was great (I usually play story mode games, so I don't know how will it do on competitive games)

Build Quality: It's good for this price, but it could be improved, especially the headband region. I had some problems with buttons initially not registering the commands, but it's OK for now.

Battery: They claim 34 Hrs of Battery backup, and I am getting some 30-ish hours. Charges to full from 10% within some 3 hours.

Comfort: The Cushions is good, the headband was too tight in the 1st week, but it adjusted to my head size, so now it's OK. I use it like 4‚Äì5 hrs a day and continuously like 2 hours. Sometimes you have to remove and place it again to remove that irritation. I don't recommend this to people with big head size.

Connectivity: Supports up to 2 devices in Bluetooth & 1 wired connection. No issue & easy pairing.

App: There isn't much here, just an equalizer.

Mic: It's good quality and is clear, nothing much to say

The only thing I found very irritating was when I am listening to some music in my MacBook and my phone sends a notification tone, the music doesn't resume when paused, whereas it will after you hang up a call.

Overall, a good headphone. I liked it; These headphones are really cool no problem like latency while gaming because it has a app on mobile where you can swith to gaming mode; Horrible horrible product i bought it 8 months ago and it broke couple months ago. Then i bought the product again since previous one broke and i liked its look and it broke again in 2 months and they dont take responsibility for their poor product.; Buttons are very hard to press, otherwise a good purchase; The product itself is great with good sound quality, comfortable cushions, but the packaging was not good normally Amazon packaging is there based on product meaning for the box of headphones there would another box but this team it was not there even bubble wraping was not proper & Box of Headphones was damaged; Sound is amazing but roo small for me; Me encantan, m√°s porque al descargar la app de skullcandy te permite que mejores el sonido. Tambi√©n tiene para b√∫squeda en caso de que los pierdas. Y ya incorporaron el Jack para utilizarlo si se te descargan los aud√≠fonos. Si dud√© un poco envolver a adquirir este tipo de aud√≠fonos porque ya van dos que se me rompen y uno me dur√≥ menos del a√±o. Pero la verdad es que lo vi en promoci√≥n y los cuidare m√°s. Adem√°s quee ya tiene m√°s duraci√≥n de bater√≠a. Los compre en diciembre y solo los he cargado dos veces (es abril); Toller Klang und ei gutes Tragegef√ºhl.; Very good quality, sound system is very good , so many kids at school asked my daughter for the link to buy one to , is really good .; Me gustaron, son ligeros y se adaptan bien a m√≠ cabeza... Los pill√© de oferta, no me puedo quejar. üòÅ; DESIGN:
Belle, comodissime, coprenti interamente la superficie laterale del padiglione, ma leggere. Cuscinetti morbidissimi. Materiale del guscio dei padiglioni piacevole al tatto, come lievissimamente gommato (il lato negativo √® che trattiene facilmente le impronte, e pazienza). Regolazione asticelle efficace, non troppo dura, giusta.

FUNZIONAMENTO GENERALE E SUONO:
Funzionano abbastanza bene, si sentono bene.
Ogni tanto sul notebook, specie quando non √® molto carico, danno qualche segno di malfunzionamento, come se il bluetooth non prendesse bene, e il flusso audio risulta impreciso (a tratti pi√π veloce e a tratti pi√π lento poi ancora veloce... nel giro di pochi secondi). Devo ancora capire perch√© qualche volta si comportano in questa maniera. Il pi√π delle volte comunque funzionano benissimo tranquillamente.
Indossate, si sentono i suoni esterni, attutiti passivamente pochissimo, direi un 10-20%.

MULTIPOINT:
Il multipoint √® meraviglioso, velocissimo, credo il pi√π veloce che io abbia provato, comprese cuffie molto pi√π costose e blasonate.

This one though in its wifi 2.4 ghz mode is the hero you want, although I have heard complaints from the poeple on other end of the call of reduced voice quality over the one i was using before, the improvement in sound quality on this one without any gimmicky dolby stuff is awesome. I would recommend it even if you get it for audio alone, I felt the quality was much better than the previous wired boat headphones which had the gimmicky dolby lifetime subscription. If you want gimmicky audio I would suggest you use open source HeSuVi and EqualizerAPO for your software based surround sound needs rather than pay subscriptions for similar stuff, upto your personal preferences though.

Also this one doesn't have a separate mic other that the attachment as advertised, or maybe the separate one doesn't work without the attachment affixed. I hope they do add one in the next iteration of this product though.

Comfortable enough for me to wear it throughout the day, and move freely around without pesky wires. For the range cant say much though, as I am never that far from the source when using it, but I have noticed the audio crackling when i was two walls away from source or one wall away and near a metallic or magnetic interference like a fridge. It was fine after i got away from it though.; These headphones don't have ultra-low latency. Their mic quality is the worst.; W Connectivity is snappy and quick. Microphone is decent.
Sound quality is good enough. You get what you pay for.
No easy way to switch devices.
Exceptional battery life. I use it throughout the day and seems comfortable to me.; If your requirements are
1. Bluetooth headset
2 mic
3. Long hours without charging
4. Mike can be separated if listening to songs
5. Good quality
6. No pain on ears after long hours
7. Perfect sound clarity and bass

This is best in this range.

Why I didn't gave 5 stars ?
1. When connected with usb, mic don't work
2. I need to buy a stand, ofcourse no one is providing that with headset.; These wireless headphones are great for the price sound quality is very good and battery lasts a long time I love it! Superb overall performance.; The headphones are too too big. Each can is the size of small football. The fit is too tight. Will cause redness and pain in 30 minutes of use. And the best thing is you can't return it! :D enjoy. 0 stars.

Edit - now that I did end up using it. I want to add that sound quality is good. The mic quality is good. This whole package is indeed good for the price. Nothing comes close at this price point. Fit still feels tight however and I feel like removing them after about 30 minutes of use.; "

1. Comfort- the cushions are smooth and perfect. You can listen to long hours without any discomfort
2. Build quality is good for this price range. These aren't too hard on ear too
3. Sound quality is very good. You can expect that from skullcandy. Tones are good. Bass is not very high but enough for a normal listener. If you are a bass lover, then that's some drop for you.
4. Sound quality is more better with the aux connected as is the case with all other wireless headphones
4. Charging 10 min give upto 1hr 30min of listening time. Good for taking and making calls
Cons: 1. I think the audio volume is not great. You can't hear it loud enough till you increase it to more than 70%
2. No noise cancellation but upto 60% of the noise is impeded by the on ear cushions. You can't expect more noise cancellation at this price.

Overall, a great purchase. Highly recommended at this price range. Don't doubt. You can go for it; Earlier I was using Sony MDR XB450 and tried JBL tune 500Bt. JBL was not at all comfortable so I returned it. So I tried üíÄ. This Headphones are the best compared to both. Bass is just Perfect. Cushions are very comfortable. You can use it for 3-4 hours easily without any pain on ears. Skullcandy will never let you down. If you are confused then go for it.; I purchased it one year before, July 2021, now it is Sept 2022. What I liked about this product is the battery. But what is the use if the exterior gets random cracks? There are cracks forming around the headset and apparently the bass has also gone worse. Do you want a product that goes well just for a year or you want to buy something that lasts longer? I used to have Sony, was good but the cushion was poor. I opted for Skullcandy for an upgrade but I think I rather go back to Sony.; I do strength training mostly, and some running. Never fallen off once. Do get a bit hot due to on ear design.

These are perfect for when u need that bass to slap you like your dad when he sees your math grades.
11/10.

p.s not for casual listening, when u can actually hear the rest of the music its quite muddy, unless you lower the bass on EQ; I recently purchased the Skullcandy Cassette Wireless On-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black) from the Amazon.in app, and I must say that I am quite impressed with the sound quality and bass experience they offer. The headphones provide an immersive audio experience, allowing me to enjoy my favorite music, movies, and games with exceptional clarity and depth. The sound reproduction is crisp, and the bass is powerful, adding an extra dimension to my audio.

The build quality of the product is impressive when you first purchase it. The materials used feel sturdy and durable, giving a premium look and feel to the headphones. The cushioned ear cups provide a comfortable fit, allowing for extended listening sessions without any discomfort.

However, after approximately a year of use, I did notice some issues with the durability of the product. The sponge padding on the headphones started to tear, which was quite disappointing. I initially thought it might have been due to sweat, but considering that the headphones are advertised as water-resistant, I expected them to withstand such conditions. This made me question the practicality and true effectiveness of their water-resistant claims.

Overall, I would still recommend the Skullcandy Cassette Wireless On-Ear Headphones for those seeking the best sound quality and bass experience. However, it's important to note that the durability may be a concern after a year of use. If you decide to purchase this product, I would advise being mindful of the potential wear and tear on the sponge padding. It is crucial to manage your expectations and understand that the headphones may not hold up as well over time.; Sound quality is average and at full volume it can also be used as a speaker from headset its loud without any quality at full volume if u listen at low volume its good . comfort level is really low if you wear this for more than 30 mins your ears will start paining . Overall I dont suggest anyone to buy this headset .; I have been used many headphone of different brands such as bose jbl etc but i found this headphone the best i bougth it for rs 2600 and i have been using it from 4.5 years and they are still look like new and have the sound quality and comfort same as when it was new i prefer you to buy this; Si lo tuyo es subir el volumen al m√°ximo, estos audifonos son ideales, sonido con mucho poder y gran calidad en el bajeo, SONIDO POTENTE!
Adem√°s de ser comodos y ligeros, excelente opci√≥n!; I've been getting this brand for years and they never disappoint! Great headphones with great sound! Amazing price and good value. Charges easily and quickly and hours of use!; Update, love the sound and comfort with these headphones but they all break the same according to the other reviews. I purchased a second pair that came broken in the same way the other pair I ordered from here broke. üòì
Beneath is my old review. I would suggest spending more. I got lucky with that one pair I raved about below.
The plastic is very low grade and it will break in the same place even if you‚Äôre gentle

OLD REVIEW
I adore these headphones. I wear them just about every single day and at the gym. They stay on, are comfortable (padding at the top of your head) the sound quality for $40 cannot be beat, very decent.
These are under $40 and have a great connectivity. Sometimes I charge my phone in a room while I‚Äôm in the kitchen and it remains connected!

In the gym I get highly sweaty and they work beautifully and have held up to being sanitized every day.
I‚Äôve accidentally stepped on them and crushed them as well as throwing them in my bag and wearing them in rain storms (multiple times).
I am irresponsible with them üòÇ they‚Äôve held up. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing that but if you do they‚Äôll most likely survive.
I‚Äôve spilled coffee on them etc. you name it.

They have small cracks at the sides due to my negligence that are hardly noticeable.
Charging is fairly quick.

I would strongly recommend them.

Love the pricing, the quality and I feel they‚Äôll be great for another 2 years or so. Once they‚Äôre done I can see myself returning for another pair or having them repaired. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

If you‚Äôre seeking something cheap, cheerful and reliable; these will get the job done!

Also, I‚Äôve worn them for crazy long hours at a time and have never once had them die on me? üòÇ I charge them at the end of each night as I use them daily.; Scoperte a Stansted ma non avevo tempo di acquistarle. Ne ho prese due paia (una per me e una per mia figlia). Sono cuffie fenomenali, gran resa nei bassi, il suono √® bello corposone. Un po' scarso il microfono per le telefonate, ma uno le cuffie per prende per ascoltare la musica (il thrash metal esce da Dio; When using it on my Samsung TV, the minimum volume is too loud.
I would like to push the volume down, just to protect my ear (but that is not possible)."

Your headset is shipped in power saver mode. The headset is only 10% charged. Failure to do so may cause connectivity issues.,"Pros:
1. Really long battery life - one charge would last me a week of regular use.
2. Sturdy build - I move around pretty roughly and the never saw the wires tearing anywhere even after 2 years
3. Decent sound - I am not an audiophile. Don't know much about trebble, bass, highs, lows. The sound was good.

Cons:
1. Once the battery percentage is below 20, you can't listen to music as it keeps shouting ""Oops! Battery low"" every five seconds. This was the most irritating part and kept me wondering why it is even there.
2. It picks a lot of noise while calling if you are in a slightly busy space like office, or road. So not meant for calling
3. The rubber grip that helps to hold it in place came out easily as it would rub against my bag. Since then, I couldn't use it properly as the earphones would fall off.; This is product is very impressive with many fuctions like sound quality and it's durability of battery power. Service is also nice to reach to the customer. At this range they value for your money. Also light weighted product to feel comfortable.; Overall bass and treble balance is good, and music is good. Battery life is excellent, Icharge it once every two weeks. What I don't like is that the right side is heavier than the left side for the additional control switch present, which add to weight. Except this, its a very good product.; Just received the product. Yet to use for some time before I can give a detailed review. At the outset, product seems good. But I was very put off by the poor quality of the USB-C Cable. It does not work. Tried calling Amazon to report this, but only got automated messages with a promise to call back in one minute which did not happen! I hope to receive a replacement USB-C Cable of better quality which works well. This is a small accessory but the poor quality is tarnishing the name of a good brand like BoAT. Very sad!; I am posting this review after i am using ut for 1 month, see everything is good sound, battery, noise cancellation.
But the most worst thing is those 2 hook like structure which makes your earbud fix to you ear sp it won't fall but after 30 min u will feel pain in the where it stucks, and after like 1 hrs it gets worse. So main. Problem is those little outbreak on earpiece.
Rest is good in this price I don't see any change in sound after changing the mode. But everything is balanced.
If you are talking about calling experience it is good not best but good.; 1. The Product Was Good,Without Any Damage.
2. The Earphones Battery Was Insane, Nearly 2Weeks Without Charge.
3. The Earphones Has Good Durability,Water Resistance.
4. The Price Was Really Ok,Good.
5. The BeastXp Mode Was Really Nice,Noise Cancellation Was Good,Low Latency Was Ok.; Durability - The only negative point and the biggest issue is the durability. I bought this neckband in Nov 2023 and in 6 months, one of the ears has stopped working. This is the standard issue of all Boat earphones.
Sound quality - Great sound quality. I can easily differentiate between the different layers of music. Audio is also clear. Never had an issue with hearing. Even the microphone is good.
Battery life - Great battery life! I have charged the band only a few times. Even after using 4-5 hours every day, I didn't need to recharge the battery for the whole week.; Nothing spectacular but will get you through the day. Sound quality is average no noise cancellation but that can go by without noticing . Durability is surely a plus one. Light weight . No complains so far."

All in All I'm impressed and hoping to use them for atleast a year as it's sturdy and looks good and gives extra comfort; Worst experience with this earphones is about gaming.

I don't think this is good product for music lovers.
Right side stopped working.
Also left one stopped working after the repair received.
The after sales support is worst.
They don't arrange the courier for initiating repair. Also no reimbursement will be provided after raising ticket.
Written so many mails to boult team but no single response received.
The worst ever customer service.
Bluetooth connection issues.
Automatically sound gets disconnected.; Nice quality product with lots of features like 50mm low latency mode, ENC mic, water proof from sweating, Easy to pair & use it.
Has a good bass with 10mm driver & control buttons & has C type pin for fast charging with long battery backup upto 30 hrs. Tangle free quality cables with decent twin colour of black & green.
Need to see its durability in future as purchased recently.; It's been 10 days since i am using product. Magnetic connect of ear piece do not disconnect the connection vice versa. Volume button is of no use. Sound quality good but it is costly when other functionality not working.; For this price,better product; Very nice.... Affordable price...

Amazon and vendor Miss guiding and selling the product in Amazon site. This is cheating.; Stopped working in 3 months.

These headphones have been a lifesaver for us‚Äîthey're durable, comfortable, and best of all, they come with a volume limiter to protect my kids' ears.

The adjustable headband and foldable design make them easy to store and transport, and the built-in microphone is a handy feature for when they're using them for online classes or video calls.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with this purchase. These headphones have been a reliable and long-lasting investment, and I would highly recommend them to any parent looking for a safe and durable option for their kids.; This head phone sits comfortably on my sons head and I love how easily can be adjusted.; These are great kids headphones! My son (5) says that they're way more comfortable than the last two sets we've tried. They actually expand large enough to fit my head as well, which is nice for checking volume (and the sound quality seems really good to me too, especially for such a low price). I like that they have a db limiter built in so that he can't accidentally set the volume to damaging levels (we previously had a set of bluetooth headphones that seemed to ALWAYS be way too loud, without warning, as soon as they would connect). Two other things that I love about these: the plug is small enough that it fits our iPad with the case on comfortably (we've had another pair that had a really thick housing around the plug that made it difficult to use with devices that had cases on them), and the braided cable seems very robust - I have confidence that it will last a long time.
The folding feature is great for travel as well - I DO wish that someone would design a better solution for wrapping/storing the cable when not in use though - maybe some clips on the sides to wrap the cable around neatly, or even just a little strap attached to the cord that could be used to bundle it.; I bought these for a recent trip. They are intended for kids but they are adjustable and fit me with plenty of room to spare. They worked well and I was very happy with the price. They feel a little flimsy but the sound quality is decent. Good value for your money!; I bought these for my 6yr old to keep at school. They were broke within the first few months of school.

So, I was looking for a wired headset which I can wear while riding my bike. Something that will not fall off while driving and will while wearing helmet. Also, I didn't wanted to cut off the ambient noise. So, I went for these because they come with rubber plugs that will stick to your ear for exercise/other active modes and they also have a regular cover for regular use. The wire is flat and it's an imported product from HP. The quality of the music is good, ok bass, sound is crisp and clear, definitely not made for music. But it still delivers good quality of music and also call quality is very good. All-in-all, it's a very good budget-friendly on ear headset. I got it for under Rs. 400/- in Diwali-2023 Sale.; There earbuds does stay inside ears, they fall very frequently! Otherwise built quality and voice quality is good!; Don't buy this product though it comes from a reputed company HP. The product quality is suspect and the ease of use is just not there. You need to continuously adjust the earphones because they tend to slip out of the ears.; Nice sound quality and very nice built quality... Loving it... Best value for money...; Nice and good .; I got it for 290, in a sale. Absolutely worth it, for the price. The rest of my review will also be ""with respect to this price"", please note.
Sound quality is really good! Did not expect this much bass coming from a headset this cheap.
There are two attachments that come with the headphones, one of them, has an extension for good fit, and may cause pain to the ear, the other doesn't have that and is small, and falls off the ear quite easily. I use the bigger one because I need a sturdy fit. I can feel some pain after 15 mins though.
You cannot use it without these attachments, because then you will have a headset that is too exposed to sweat. Feels like it would get short circuited or something.
But worth it. I use it for phone calls and sometimes for youtube, its really good. :); Durable; „Ç§„É§„Éõ„É≥„Å£„Å¶ÁµêÊßãÂ£ä„Çå„Å¶Ë≤∑„ÅÑÊõø„Åà„Çã„Åì„Å®„ÅåÂ§ö„ÅÑ„ÅÆ„Åß„Åô„Åå„ÄÅ„Åì„Çå„ÅåÈï∑ÊåÅ„Å°„Åô„Çã„Åã„ÅØÂàÜ„Åã„Çä„Åæ„Åõ„Çì„ÄÇÂâç„Å´‰Ωø„Å£„Åü„Ç§„É§„Éõ„É≥„Çà„ÇäÈü≥„ÅØ„Çà„Åï„Åí„Åß„Åô„ÄÇÂ§â„Å™Á™ÅËµ∑„Åå„ÄÅ„ÅØ„Åò„ÇÅ„ÅØËÄ≥„Å´„Éï„Ç£„ÉÉ„Éà„Åó„Å¶„Çà„ÅÑ„Åã„Å®ÊÄù„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åó„Åü„Åå„ÄÅÂ∞ë„ÅóÂ§ß„Åç„ÅÑ„Çà„ÅÜ„Åß„ÄÅËÄ≥„ÅåÁóõ„Åè„Å™„Çä„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇÂπ∏„ÅÑÁ™ÅËµ∑„ÅåÁÑ°„ÅÑ„ÅÆ„ÇÇ‰ªòÂ±û„Åó„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÅÆ„Åß‰ªä„ÅØ„Åù„Å°„Çâ„Åß‰Ωø„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ; „Ç´„Éä„É´Âûã„ÅåÂ•Ω„Åç„Åß„Å™„ÅÑ„ÅÆ„Åß„ÄÅ„Åì„ÅÆ„Çø„Ç§„Éó„ÇíÈÅ∏„Å≥„Åæ„Åó„Åü„Åå„ÄÅËÄ≥‰∏≠„Å∏„ÅÆÁ¥ç„Åæ„Çä„ÅåÊÇ™„Åã„Å£„Åü„ÅÆ„Åß‰Ωø„ÅÑ„ÇÑ„Åô„ÅïË©ï‰æ°Ôºí„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ

It produces sounds with 1st 1sec input missing. You could guess how that can affect your gaming. Otherwise it produces decent sound in case of bass and treble and vocals too. If u want this for just entertainment go for it, never for gaming"

We make that happen for you with Tru Bass, Tru Balance and Tru Rock.; 10mm Driver:- Dive into the world of balanced audio quality.; ENC for superior calling:- Experience a clear calling experience when you talk on the phone with Environmental Noise Cancellation.; Low Latency (up to 50ms):- Gaming, talking or listening to music - it‚Äôs a lag-free zone with up to 50ms of low latency.; Sporty elegant design:- Designed for flexibility and comfort, making your audio experience look as great","The FIRST and primary features is the microphone. The other person in line can hear my voice crystal clear and without any background noise. (Most of the bluetooth headphones have unpleasant background noise and with the person on the other end not hearing us properly )

SECONDLY, the battery back up is incredible. It can last a day with frequent use and lose only about 10%-20% of the total capacity.

THIRDLY, the buttons are placed distinctly and protruding, which makes it very convenient. (Yes flat buttons are confusing and we tend to press the wrong ones)

FOURTH point is that the bass quality is pretty good.
Other advantages includes good quality plastic and wire material, even the ear plugs are soft and comfortable. The magnet also works well and the bluetooth doesn't get disconnected even when they gets attached. (some bluetooth gets disconnected when the magnet gets attached or kept un used for a while, which i find it very inconvenient)

The ONLY DISADVANTAGE i find is that even the lowest volume is loud for me, especially while using it at night or when your surrounding is calm.; I actually purchased this product as I was tight on budget. I searched for a lot of neckbands and bought this. Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
1. The build quality and look of the neckband feels premium and durable compared to Mivi collar 2

2. Sound quality is quite good..it gets loud enough but not too loud. Bass is on point and overall you get a very well balanced sound quality.

3. The battery life is simply amazing. It lasts for about 3 days and my usage is 3-4 hours per day.

4. It has a Qualcomm chipset which is okayish for this price point. Noice cancellation is also average.

5. It supports dual pairing- this means that you can connect upto 2 devices with this neckband and the audio switches automatically as you go from one device to another (however I noticed a delay of 2-3 seconds).

6. Mic quality is good enough. The other person can hear clearly.

Cons:

1. You do not get AptX or AptX HD. For those who don‚Äôt know these are Bluetooth audio codecs. You can google it out and see which audio codecs does your phone support. If you are an iPhone user like me then you can use this as iPhone only supports AAC codec.

2. You do not get a thumping bass. So for bass lovers I do not recommend this. If you like a more balanced and crisp sound then go for it.

3. Latency - as it does not have AptX HD so it has latency while gaming compared to Boat rockerz 335 and OnePlus wireless buds (YouTube, prime, netflix works fine)

4. It has micro usb port. This product was launched in 2020 but still has a micro usb port instead of a type C.

5. There is a hissing sound continuously on this and boat rockerz which I did not notice on mivi collar 2

Conclusion: Well if the pros and cons did not help you out then here are my final thoughts on this. If you are someone who likes to listen to a lot of music and not overwhelming bass then this product is really good. The battery life is great you get atleast 10 hours of battery on 80-90% volume. It‚Äôs not for gaming so don‚Äôt buy it just for gaming purpose.; Nice product, Batery life is also good & sound quality is marvellous; I have to change my mind its worthless stopped working in a usage of short duration, i request that kindly ignore below conclusion, its useless don't go with it

In this Review i will be covering good and bad aspect and how genuinely it seems to me at first sight, it depends on insight and experiences and gives you general idea about whether you should purchase it or not, following points given below:-

Prosüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

Delivery:-i am restless kid who don't believe in waiting, trust me Amazon,s key point that will never disappoint and never want you to wait so long. The only exception is that when order reaches from other city then it takes 4 to 5 days, which as per the usual process considerable

Box Content:- it comes with noise registration leaflet, manual, micro usb cable, extra pair of earbuds

Connectivity:-Its perfect but lags somehow, its hard to proceed far away. Mainly it depends on obstacles how it works.

Battery:- i haven't charged it since the day product arrived and with mixed usage, battery level not yet reduced despite of mixed and moderate use. And still manage to be at 80%.

Sound quality:-
Considering the price point, audio is just perfectly balanced the good point is its a blend of perfect tuning. Seperation of instruments and vocal can be easily identified. In short music lovers will start loving it, apart from that extra bass is just gimmick. Else its brilliant and produce best sound, songs feels bit low and average in normal mode but when turn to extra bass mode then the sound accompanied by bass. In short its sound and audio is just perfect for what is right, balanced thats what made it so different. Trust me i was skeptical and i returned 6 to 7 earphones and headphones just because they have not met my expectations but it stands on my expectations, brilliant work.

Cons:-üëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

Bass:-üòî
To remind that functional button is there change the mode from normal to extra bass, its just a gimmick and need a thoughtful touch before introducing it.it doesn't work that way they condemn it.

Build quality:- no doubt its perfect, but its earbuds are quite old fashioned, design is just overtly laid which were downside and i don't like that much.

Noise cancellation:- There is no reduction of noise however its one bad aspect considering the price points

Ear buds:- Doesn't fit well in my ears, its not that they came but it seems to be loosened and noise could have given in ear design,metal housing is not there, and earbuds were overtly designed, its modern trend to have in ear design which fits perfect and it lacks these qualitiesüòî

Conclusionüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

bought these neckband although this could be premium and stay around for a while, to say its premium and classy but can't beat boat rockers 255 in terms of bass. Apart from bass its perfect comparing to boat rockers, dont know about the durability, At first glance these neckbands are show stealers. Trust me sound quality is what you need then you may go for it, considering its bad aspect you may also prefer to ignore; This neckband is good for general use, if you lookinh for bass‚Äî don't buy it.
however sound quality is pretty good in terms of clear audio. But Music Lovers, it's not for you.

Magnetic Tips are just to keep it together, it doesn't have any function!
When you connect tips ‚Äî
‚Ä¢ it doesn't pause your music
‚Ä¢ it doesn't Disconnect your BT.

i found BOAT ROCKERZ much better purchase in terms for functionality and music.

And there is no RETURN POLICY. so purchase it wisely.; Really appreciate your product for it's good quality sound, unique design and great looks. Keep going. Thank you."

Now trying to charge my S22 Ultra and iPhone 12 Pro max, the one another reject to charge and device force to remove the cable. Disappointed

Only one device u can charge at a time. Waste of money.

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

I recently had the opportunity to try out a pair of earbuds that have genuinely enhanced my listening experience. These earbuds have impressed me with their sound quality, comfort, and overall performance. Allow me to share my detailed review.

First and foremost, the sound quality delivered by these earbuds is exceptional. The audio is clear, balanced, and immersive, allowing me to truly appreciate the nuances in my favorite music. The bass is rich and punchy, while the midrange and treble frequencies are well-defined and crisp. Whether I'm listening to classical melodies or energetic rock tunes, these earbuds consistently deliver an enjoyable audio experience.

Comfort is another aspect where these earbuds shine. They come with a variety of ear tip sizes, ensuring a secure and comfortable fit for different ear shapes. The lightweight design and ergonomic shape make them easy to wear for extended periods without causing discomfort or fatigue. I appreciate that they stay securely in place, even during workouts or active movements.

The battery life of these earbuds is commendable as well. They provide a substantial playtime on a single charge, allowing for uninterrupted listening throughout the day. The charging case is compact and portable, making it convenient to carry and ensuring that the earbuds are always ready to use.

One feature I particularly appreciate is the seamless Bluetooth connectivity. Pairing the earbuds with my devices was effortless, and the connection remained stable without any dropouts. The wireless range is impressive, allowing me to move around without being tethered to my device. Additionally, the earbuds feature intuitive touch controls, allowing easy access to play/pause, volume adjustment, and call management.

While the overall performance of these earbuds is exceptional, I did encounter a minor drawback. The noise isolation could be improved, especially in louder environments. Although they provide some passive noise reduction, ambient sounds can still be heard, which may affect the immersion in certain situations.

In conclusion, these earbuds have impressed me with their superior sound quality, comfort, and convenient features. They offer an immersive listening experience, and their long battery life ensures uninterrupted enjoyment. Despite a minor limitation in noise isolation, these earbuds are a reliable choice for music enthusiasts and individuals seeking a wireless audio solution.

Inspired by our #1 selling ATH-M20x wired professional studio headphones and featuring powerful 40 mm drivers for enhanced low-frequency performance, the ATH-M20xBT Bluetooth headphones deliver an incredible listening experience with full-range, high-fidelity audio and enhanced bass.","Hands down better than anything which is available out there and that to in this price range. The sounds are very crisp and clear. The headphones have the perfect amount of bass as well. Basically, its a solid buy.; Blue tooth is vary good .it pairs fast.; the product met expectations; Good üîä; First - the cushion of the headphone fell off. Tried to connect with customer care on a Sunday - didn't get a call back. Spoke on a Monday - won't replace or return the product, cut the phone call rudely and refused to allow a reconnect.
UNACCEPTABLE; Gostei muito. Recomendo; This is about the M20xBT, but I'll begin with my feelings about the M50 model. I've owned a pair of ATH-M50 headphones (with built in cable) for about 7 years and I've become a bit fed with it, why? Comfortability & price. That model does squeeze against my head, and presses against parts of my ears because the pads are thick. I can't stand to wear them for more than ~30 minutes max before I feel like taking them off. The sound however was good. Not terrific or outstanding but it's good. I like the M50xbt model even less, and I don't even own those.

The regular ATH-M50 cost roughly $70-$80 in 2017. And now a bluetooth model costs about $180. Because the bluetooth needs to be $100 more. lmao.

So I wanted to try the ATH-M20xBT. These headphones are just about perfect for me at nearly every angle I can currently think of. I can literally call these ""over ear"" headphones because these don't press against my ears at all. The pads are just the right thickness; the contour of their design nests comfortably around my own ears. The materials don't weigh a lot, they sit light and comfortably on my head. I don't grow fatigued with them like other headphones that clamp hard against the skull. Before I knew it I was wearing these for more than an hour multiple times. They're just really comfortable to wear.

The price was on point. If you're not an audiophile and have an opportunity to buy these for $60-$70 or even less, do try them. Try not to waste your money on these @ $80+

Sound is servicable, it's good. Not top of the line outstanding quality for the price range, but if you like a bit of bass you would enjoy these. They become even better if you have access to an audio app with built in equalizer settings.

The material construction is also serviceable and don't bother with these if you dislike exposed wires, but I don't mind them. Take care of them like any other headphones and they are likely to last a while.; ; The sound was good for a set costing around this amount. I picked mine up during a sale so I'm satisfied with the value. I cant judge how they'll fit on you but i have a medium/large head and they fit me fine. The earcups were large enough cup my ears without pinching. I've worn them for a two hour session outside.

Battery life is rated at 60 hours which is really good., In low latency mode, my PC reported 58ms of lag (3 frames if watching video/gaming at 60fps). Without low latency mode lag was 180ms (unusable for games or watching video). Wired mode worked fine, though i wish the cable was longer for home use (it is a standard cable though so it can be swapped). Cable is perfect for using with a phone.; Um excelente headphone, incompar√°vel a qualidade sonora da Audio Technica com outras marcas. Sem contar que o conforto desse fone √© √∫nico.

I already have Nokia BH 505, Sennheiser HD 4.40, & Byte Corseca DM5710 in the wireless category and Sennheiser CX 180, JBL C150si & MI basic earphones. To be honest, wrt sound quality, this Boat one is far behind all of them except MI basic & Byte Corseca where it's equivalent.

The reason being, you can't get everything at such a low price point. If you want good quality in-ear wireless experience to be ready to shell out more.

Every product category has a minimum price value required for impressive performance. Below that value, compromises need to be made.

P.S. Battery backup is not an issue owing to the form factor. It's comparable to BH 505 and ranges around 5-6 hours. It even cant be compared to over the ear HD 4.40 as it has a hefty battery inside.

In the returned product, the mic was not working properly and had sound quality issues while in case of connectivity, it had frequent disconnection issues.

So make it a habit to thoroughly check the product within its replacement window of 10 days, and in case of any issue contact Amazon asap instead of complaining later on and providing a low rating.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

‚ñ∂ For the price point, this earphone is a good buy with nice sound output, heavy bass, and good backup. I have been using it for 4-5 months and so far didn't face any issue.

‚ñ∂ If you can increase your budget go for JBL -> Sony -> Senheisser (increasing order of price and sound quality)

‚ñ∂ BUT if you are not obsessed with wireless functionality or you can avoid this wireless part, better invest that amount in wired in-ear earphones (over the ear will require further investment) as for the same amount you will get astounding sound quality.; Good quality of voice and connectivity also good. At a time two device can connect. Durability also superb.; Here is my review for boat Rockerz 255 pro ( blazing yellow ) . Got it for Rs. 930. Its original price is 1399. If you are getting it below 1k go for it otherwise its not worth it. If you're in a tight budget then only go for boat . Otherwise go for brands like realme, oppo, Mi, OnePlus, Dizo etc. Okay here is my in depth review explanation.
1. Build quality - 3/5.
The neckband is made of decent quality plastic. The ear phones are made of metal and has magnets to stick together without falling.
2. Sound quality - 4/5.
Im satisfied with the sound quality . It produces good bass , and clear vocals even at high volume. No issues with it. It supports AAC which is not that good, doesn't feel the difference.
3. Battery life - 4/5.
Battery life is good. Gives around 5-6 hours at 80% volume. which is pretty good.
4. Call quality - 4/5 .
Im not a person who take much calls in this neckband Call quality is good and nothing to complaint. Both ends are clear.

Pros-
1. Sound quality is good.
2. Latency is very minimal. In BGMI and most of the games the latency is less and playable. Nothing too bad to complain . The gameplay is playable with it.
3. Battery life is good. And charging is also pretty fast . Can be charged in 1 hour.
Cons -
1. For the price 1399 its totally not worth it.
2. The wire length from the neckband to the earphones is a bit short . If you are in a situation to raise your head the band will lift and give a uncomfortable feel.
3. These band is more than a year old since its launch so its a bit outdated.
4. No call vibration alert. If you are a person who takes lot of calls you need to reach the phone to know who is calling.
5. Joining the earbuds will not pause the content which is a bummer at this price point.

Hope this review will help you to decide . Will update if any good or bad things found about the band. Thank you for reading.; Good build quality, battery backup nice,good sound quality; So I am here to write review after using for 2 years

I had purchased this after saving for almost 6 months so had lots of expectations from this product.

Sound quality is good but you cannot compare with JBL
Noise cancellation is worst as whole travelling i couldn't attend call ...voice was more clear without using this product.

Material is not so good...plastics strips came out after some days but it is still working.
Value for money I can say because it is still working after 2 years; Yesterday I got Boat neckband, 1stly its battry was totally discharged, then I tried to charge, no charging light is showing, I charged it for 2 hours, then tried to connect, after many attempts it got connected. After 1-2 hours of using it suddenly got disconnected m switched off, again I started, 1 hour later again switched off. Every time I connect it shows 100% battery, then 90/80% then switch off, in 2 days, almost 20 times it got disconnected n switched off, I m totally fedup with this project, I m gonna return it. Faulty product of rs. 1299.. total waste of money...bad very bad experience with this.. never recommend to anyone üòïüòï; Its been 5 years and i can still use it...

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

I recently had the opportunity to try out a pair of earbuds that have genuinely enhanced my listening experience. These earbuds have impressed me with their sound quality, comfort, and overall performance. Allow me to share my detailed review.

First and foremost, the sound quality delivered by these earbuds is exceptional. The audio is clear, balanced, and immersive, allowing me to truly appreciate the nuances in my favorite music. The bass is rich and punchy, while the midrange and treble frequencies are well-defined and crisp. Whether I'm listening to classical melodies or energetic rock tunes, these earbuds consistently deliver an enjoyable audio experience.

Comfort is another aspect where these earbuds shine. They come with a variety of ear tip sizes, ensuring a secure and comfortable fit for different ear shapes. The lightweight design and ergonomic shape make them easy to wear for extended periods without causing discomfort or fatigue. I appreciate that they stay securely in place, even during workouts or active movements.

The battery life of these earbuds is commendable as well. They provide a substantial playtime on a single charge, allowing for uninterrupted listening throughout the day. The charging case is compact and portable, making it convenient to carry and ensuring that the earbuds are always ready to use.

One feature I particularly appreciate is the seamless Bluetooth connectivity. Pairing the earbuds with my devices was effortless, and the connection remained stable without any dropouts. The wireless range is impressive, allowing me to move around without being tethered to my device. Additionally, the earbuds feature intuitive touch controls, allowing easy access to play/pause, volume adjustment, and call management.

While the overall performance of these earbuds is exceptional, I did encounter a minor drawback. The noise isolation could be improved, especially in louder environments. Although they provide some passive noise reduction, ambient sounds can still be heard, which may affect the immersion in certain situations.

In conclusion, these earbuds have impressed me with their superior sound quality, comfort, and convenient features. They offer an immersive listening experience, and their long battery life ensures uninterrupted enjoyment. Despite a minor limitation in noise isolation, these earbuds are a reliable choice for music enthusiasts and individuals seeking a wireless audio solution. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality pair of earbuds.; Earbuds looks good and sound quality was nice. Charge stays for long time. But the problem is no notification sound for incoming calls if you're listening songs and receive call it'll turn into silent, if you aren't listening to song you don't know the call since it'll be silent. Another issue which I faced while driving with helmet receiver can't hear us. But noise cancelation is superb while driving without helmet receivers can clearly able to listen us.; The Boult Audio Z40 Pro is a solid choice for those looking for an affordable yet feature-packed pair of earphones. Here are some of its standout features:

1. Sound Quality: The Z40 Pro offers immersive sound quality with deep bass and crisp highs, allowing you to enjoy your music, movies, and games with clarity.

2. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): This feature helps block out ambient noise, allowing you to focus on your audio experience without distractions from the outside world.

3. Comfortable Fit: The earphones come with different-sized ear tips to ensure a comfortable and secure fit for extended listening sessions.

4. Battery Life: With a long battery life, you can enjoy hours of uninterrupted listening on a single charge.

5. Built-in Mic: The Z40 Pro features a built-in microphone for hands-free calling and voice assistant support, making it convenient for on-the-go use.

6. Durable Design: The earphones are built to last with sturdy construction, making them suitable for everyday use.

All in All I'm impressed and hoping to use them for atleast a year as it's sturdy and looks good and gives extra comfort; Worst experience with this earphones is about gaming. It produces sounds with 1st 1sec input missing. You could guess how that can affect your gaming. Otherwise it produces decent sound in case of bass and treble and vocals too. If u want this for just entertainment go for it, never for gaming"

I called and confirmed with Sony customer care. Blumaple claimed the discounted price to be INR 15,499 and unfortunately I bought it at this price. Later, when I told my friend that this is a good product he looked into it and told me that he sees a different price and MRP which forced me to dig into this and I found out the truth. Again, product is fantastic! Just be careful and buy from authorised sellers only.; Honestly I was pretty impressed with these headphones. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted to get them based off of people reviewing them poorly. However, I think the people leaving the reviews are a part of some niche headphone community. I went from AirPods to these and I can tell you these are WAY better. They are comfortable and have good sound quality. Compared to $400 Sony headphones, they might not have as good sound. But truthfully, it‚Äôs not that noticeable of a difference. I tried them all in the store and the only difference I noticed was the noise cancellation. These don‚Äôt have COMPLETE noise cancellation but they do a solid job. Overall if you can‚Äôt afford $400 headphones, these are a great alternative.; Sobre o som n√£o h√° o que reclamar, muito bom, se o seu dispositivos (PC/Smartphone) possuir algum ""equalizador"" como o Dolby Atmos ou afins, o som que j√° √© bom vira um espet√°culo, o noise cancelling funciona perfeito e isola bem barulhos do tipo repetitivos (Secador de cabelo, conversas longes e etc).

Os ""porens"" desse fone s√£o que tem muito pl√°stico, a principio parece n√£o incomodar, mas o fone √© extremamente ""mole"" ao maneja-lo fica estalando em todo quanto com impress√£o que vai quebrar, por um lado √© bom, em uma queda por exemplo por ele ser ""mole"" as chances de n√£o quebrar s√£o maiores, por√©m, pelo pre√ßo poderia ser melhor acabado.

A bateria dura bastante, por√©m existe fones mais baratos que duram mais, mas pecam com a qualidade do som ou n√£o ter noise cancelling, o que pra quem estuda ajuda demais.

E sobre o pre√ßo, a Sony tenta ser o que a Apple e a Samsung s√£o, e acaba sempre trazendo produtos bons mas com pre√ßos que n√£o disputam com as duas maiores empresas do mercado. Infelizmente, nessa faixa de pre√ßo √© dificil achar algum fone melhor que esse.

- Em resumo, o que a Sony promete com esse fone ela entrega; sem mais.; These over-the-ear headphones are very lightweight and comfortable to wear. They seemed to be designed to be operated while wearing them because they speak to you as you press the buttons, e.g. Power On/Off, Bluetooth Pairing/Connected/Disconnected, Noise Cancelling, Ambient Sound, etc. Press the power button briefly and it tells you the power level, hold the button a few seconds to turn on/off, and hold it for seven seconds to go into Bluetooth pairing mode. If you have Near Field Communications on your device, my cell phone has this capability, the Bluetooth connects and disconnects when held near the device. In the box are the headphones, and two cables: a headphone cable, and USB-A to USB-C cable. The USB cable is less that 8 inches, not sure why so short, it is difficult to plug into my charging transformer or computer. A 5-volt charging transformer is not included and it is not clear the desired wattage. It did take 7 hours to charge initially. It is listed as having a 35-hour playback time on a charge. The sound quality is very good, I play my music at very high fidelity and these headphones are handling the music exceedingly well. One thing that I wish Sony included is a case for the headphones. There are third-party cases available online. These headphones seem to provide many of the features of Sony‚Äôs higher end headphones at a more modest price point. I would certainly recommend them for everyday use. I tested the tree modes; Ambient, Noise Cancelling, and Off. We live on a busy street with much traffic, cars and heavy trucks, which was a perfect setting for the test. Noise Cancelling mode did a great job compensating for the exterior noise, the traffic is loud, and I could barely hear it. As expected in Ambient mode the microphones passed through the street sounds with the music, good if I were walking around and needed to also hear what is going on in the environment and listen to the music. Ambient off turns off the microphones so there is no pass-through sound, so it will depend on the outside volume and your music volume as to how much outside sound you hear. Ambient off also means that Noise Cancelling is off, so if you do not like the compensation that noise cancelling provides, this is your mode. I need to also disclose that I did receive these headphones at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I am pleased with the quality that these headphones provide at a very reasonable price.; I am satisfied with noise cancellation, sound quality and battery life. However, you cant wear them for a long time. I feel my ears sour after couple of hours wearing thwm.; I almost didn't buy these based on some of the negative reviews like not comfortable or bad sound quality. I don't know what they were talking about. It's great for both. My though for a quality headset that sounds good, is comfortable and long lasting battery it's great. Before these I had Bose and these are comparable at half the price( cyber Monday deal form me) the Noise canceling is ok, I don't really see a difference but not my main concern"

Just because of the brand BOAT and it's specification, I blindly ordered and it is not even close to the promises they have made. Do not buy this and waste money.

Don't buy this!!!!; Superb product; These are best earbuds under 1400, best sound quality, call quality, battery , premium grip , and bass is üî•üî• Thanks to Boat; Sound quality is very poor. It is very surprising to see such good reviews for an below average product. I also stuck in this review trap. I will not recommended this product to anyone; I have just got delivered my AirPods 121 Pro Plus

Some negatives
Case shows 100% charged but on the phone it shows 60% charge
No reset button on the case
Right EarPod some how do not auto connect need to touch the pod to get it connected manually
No instructions on the box or manual which mentions how to reset or issue with right ear pod connection

Some Positives
Good look and feel
Good finish, looks rich
Quite light weight
Price under 1200/- seems reasonable

Need to check charging which is claimed as fast 5 min charge
Need to check 100 Hrs playback

I will republish my review in couple of days; Very very good earbuds fully value for money; I purchased yesterday and received defective items today. As per my understanding, this is from first batch. Not satisfied with this product it. I wouldn:t recommend to anyone purchase this 121 pro plus.; Sound quality is good

For me, these truly wireless earbuds (TWS) have changed everything. No more juggling tangled cables or having trouble moving around. Whether I'm at the gym, driving, or just lounging around the house, they're ideal for listening to music on the go. What I adore most about them is this: * Crystal-clear sound: The sound is incredibly clear, with deep bass and sharp highs. * Snug and pleasant fit: A variety of ear tips sizes are included to provide a secure and comfortable fit that holds throughout movement. * Long battery life: With additional charges from the charging case, I can listen for hours on a single charge. Easy-to-use touch controls are available for playback, volume, and calling on the earphones.
These are really impressive wireless earbuds. They're an excellent choice for anyone seeking a high-end, fashionable, and practical listening experience. The following are some other items you may want to include in your review: * The particular brand and type of your earbuds * The pricing * The call quality * The noise-canceling capabilities (if applicable) * The price I hope this is useful.; Been using this for about 2 months. For ‚Çπ999, it's a really good product.
They connect fastly and has a good audio quality, bass too. Tuch gestures work really well. Both the case and the buds are lightweight so it's good to carry along. Different sizes and colored earpieces are provided, which I would say is great. Charging cable is also of good quality, though it's short.

Connectivity ranges to like 2 rooms in house and about 6-8 hours of playback, so it's not bad. Though the build quality is little poor as one of the earbud's piece came off from a fall. It wasn't broken, was able to join it back and worked well.

Good earbuds; This earbuds gives good sound quality. The design is also good. Bluetooth range is not that good. Battery life is excellent. Overall a seamless listening experience. It gives a outstanding performance and value. I got it just for 799/-. A good deal indeed.; The quality of the product is good but the only thing I don't like which is it does not fix properly in our ear and often got fallen from my ear. Otherwise the quality and sound quality is good; This airbuds is the best buds in the price range... I'm use hardly and enjoyed very much. I don't say that this is the best but ‚Çπ799 it's a good option. It's built quality is very impressive and sound quality decent... And performance avarage because this is not a gameing buds
I'm impressed; First purchase of a noise producr. I got this for 799. It's a steal. Great packaging and attention to details inside the box.
Coming to the product, well it's too good for the price but definitely not the best for all music genres. Tonal quality is preserved and it doesnt even need to be above 40 to 50% volume. Ergonomics could be a challenge for some. Doesn't absolutely snug in the ear without paining
Play around with the eq to get the most out of it
It is hands down better than any at this price range. Highly recommend; Good for listening music as well as for calling, clear audio, better battery life, easy charging, easy to carry.; Usage:
Regularly used for calls and watching videos.

Likes:
Attractive design and serves its purpose well. Offers good value for its price point.

Dislikes:
Fragile casing design; disassembled after a single drop. Lack of noise cancellation, which was unexpected and disappointing.

Conclusion:
These earbuds are functional for calls and video watching, with a pleasing design and reasonable price. However, durability issues and the absence of expected noise cancellation detract from the overall experience."

I hope you find this helpful

Cons : quite a lot
1. The battery lasts for less than 4 hours. Battery drains almost immediately when it reaches 20%
2. The right side ear piece just keeps switching off intermittently even though it's fully charged.
3. Ear pain. Not comfortable at all.
4. Music isn't too good. It's ok for normal calls however not for music. Unsure why the manufacturer claims this to be a full range speaker.
5. Good for office calls like teams however takes a while to pair. You have to keep deleting the paired device and reconnect if you use it in mono mode.
6. It takes a little setting when you first connect else the other person will hear an echo or you sound like you are speaking from the end of the tunnel.
7. During a normal voice call (paired with the phone) during travel, the other person cannot hear you. It picks a lot of background noise.
8. EQ doesn't work
9. No option to mute and touch controls aren't too effective. Takes a lot of getting used to: not easy.
10. The biggest con i think is the charging port. Trust me, landing on the moon is easier vs trying to connect the charger. You just do not know whether the charging cable is connected the right way until you switch it on and see the LED flashing. The charging port is somewhat hidden which makes it difficult to identify which way the cable has to be connected. Plus the charging cable is so short! This was the biggest turnoff honestly.
11. It's been 4 weeks and already the outer color
of the pods has faded. Unsure how will it look after a month's usage and don't really know how long will this last. Mind you; i only use this indoors and that too for office calls only.

Pros:

1. Amazing noise cancellation : you cannot hear any noise if you plug this well in your ear. However be prepared for annoying earaches even at low volume
2. Works in both mono and stereo mode
You can pair multiple devices and connect L+R seperately (Please note that you may need to delete and re-pair the device frequently)
3. Operating distance approx 15 feet after which the pods either disconnect or no audio captured.
4. The box has breathable LED LIGHTS that flash for about 5-10 seconds everytime you open/close the lid or try to charge

To summarise:
It's okay if you want to use this for your office calls however be prepared to keep charging it every 3-4 hours. Does not last as long nor sounds good as advertised. What ever you do please do not take a white piece, it gets dirty very fast. Unfortunately my return period has lapsed and I'm stuck with this!

I hope you find this review is helpful.; the looks is absolutely fabulous. the rgb lights are worth looking but cant be customized and the buds dont have rgb light. it only blinks in blue color when its connected but not playing any sound. the case goes in breathing mode while charging which looks great but major drawback is you cant know the battery level. battery backup of buds is good but the case dont seem to have good battery backup. 40ms is good for gaming. and enx technology is just a gimmick. rest built quality is good enough.
if you have higher budget go for mivi Q9 gaming buds it has customizable rgb both is buds and the case unlike immortal series; It is good product from boat and got good battery life, volume control, good fit, features and connectivity.; The earbuds are very well placed in the ear, the bass is average except this everything is great.; "

UI:
Power On. Hold the center button for 2 seconds and the earphones with say in a Japanese/Indian woman's voice, ""power On, battery about 70%"". She does not sound Chinese like the cheap Chinese headphones. Her voice volume level is not very high either.

BT pairing:
Turn off the headset, press and hold to center button but keep holding the same button. The headsets voice will say, Bluetooth pairing"". Once connected, it will say, ""Bluetooth connected"". If BT disconnects, the voice says, ""Bluetooth disconnected"".

Next track:
Press and hold the + button for 2 seconds and the headset will make a cute ""chime"" and load the next song in the playlist of any app. I like this feature of the chime because this way I know the headset has accepted the command and loading the next track. However, holding the button for 2 second everytime you want to change songs can get annoying and painful if you want to skip a couple of songs of just skipping endlessly waiting for the right song to play. Buttons aren't very soft but do have a tactile click to ensure you feel the click when pressed.

Power off: just like power on, hold the center button for 2 seconds and the headset will turn off.

Volume up/down: No audible feedback, just volume increase or decrease.

Status LED:
Blue: when On and slow blinking when connected to bt. When in pairing mode, the same light blinks quickly in the same blue colour.

Orange: while charging. Solid on.
Green/off: 90% and above.

Physical clues: tiny nub on the left ear plug to denote left side. Only reputed brands have it.
Same tiny bump is made in the volume up button on the controller to denote volume +.
Coloured Dots on the plastic controller to denotr left and right channel.
Ear plugs are colour coded and fit very well in my ears. Most of the ear plugs fall out of my ears while talking. These don't. I use the smallest one.

What does Sony offer?
A very neat guide on how to insert the ear plugs in your ears the most comfortable way and ensure the best seal for clear audio. I've never known that you can pull you ear up from the top corner and gently place the ear plug into your ear canal. Once placed comfortably, drop the ear and let the ear canal seal in.

Audio App. It's basically a music player designed to detect the sony earphones. If you use spotify you can use this app to setup an equaliser. It plays MP3 from your storage too. My phone already has a built in Equalizer. I don't use any eq because the sound stage on these is flat. So all types of audio sounds great.

FAQ
Is it flimsy?
No, but feels like you might damage it if you're not careful.

Does it really last 25hr?
Yes, I've tested it sort of. And never managed to run out of battery.

How much did you spend on it?
1.6k

Audio lag?
None. I tested it with Android TV, LG web os, Android phone, ps4 and iPad. No issues of lag or disconnection or audio drop on super quiet moments of the song.

Bass?
Very decent and controlled.
Vocals?
Very clear
Treble?
Sharp and crisp.
Loudness?
You can listen at full volume without much discomfort. But I'd suggest not to.

I compared it with JBL wave tws100. The sound is very similar but a we bit less bass on flat eq.
80% Better than boat airdopes.
30% better than OnePlus bulletsZ.; I will just sum it up, Sony delivers in quality on all fronts, good battery,good bass,clear sound, comfortable, good connectivity,good mic and the sound overall is Rich. Only thing i am concerned about is the quality of material used on wires,very soft and lean, somehow i feel like the material isn't durable even though after almost 4 months, it's still new and strong.; I purchased this item, trusting the brand value of Sony. But so far this is the poorest quality sound I have ever experienced in any earphone. Utterly disappointed. To be honest it sounds like a cheap road side earphone. No bass at all. No high sound even if you keep max volume. Total loss for the amount. I have used Boat and JBL earlier and they are much better compared to this cheap product. Also no magnet for earpieces. Weak quality.; I am an old customer of sony, but I was confused about this product due to the reviews. But it is what actually I want, according to sound it lacks volume but soundstage is good, trebles work perfectly, vocals are clear, bass is soothing and deep. I like the integration of application which tells me my listening hours and set an equalizer according to my preference. I don't know much about DSEE upscaling but it makes a difference, listening to these earphones feels like listening to wired earphones with no lag and weird sound upscaling which other TWS does. Build quality will be a concern for rough users but not for me, it is pretty good for me. The neck part is not stiff which makes it easy to carry. I am a designer, According to a designer's perspective I would it has attention to details like the left and right are separated even with a color difference. Although, I didn't like the long press to change controls system and its not customizable. These earphones are waterproof and have sufficient battery life to support through my busy weeks. Also we can change the language of the instructor of earphones, I chose Japanese because I am a big fan of anime. Also the buds are non magnetic, but it dosen't creates much problem. At last buy these only when you aren't a rough user and wants high volume.; I once carried it in my backpack along with my smartwatch. I don't know if this caused any signal interference but it just doesn't work properly after that. For now, it works if you bring your phone 1 cm close to the antenna (the small rectangular box on the left) but if you place your phone on the table or keep it in your pocket, it stops working. So it's just pointless to use it anymore.

I don't know if this is something common with Bluetooth headphones, neckbands, and all. But I don't think this should have happened. Something is wrong with these products. I'd better stay with wired headphones to avoid the frustration of wireless gadgets.

The sound quality, the app support, the battery and the design are so good. You can buy it if you want a cheap and quality neckband. But just don't keep it near other Bluetooth devices.; Tive dois WI-C200 que duraram 4 anos, √≥timos, e acredito que s√≥ duraram 4 anos porque era usado no sol e no suor.

Exactly what I wanted. Sound is great. They fit well in the ear, and the cable is well balanced, so they don‚Äôt fall out unless they get snagged on something. And the battery seems to last forever. Good Sony quality.; TL;DR: These minimalist headphones from Sony do everything I need them to do, and I can wear them for hours on end with no discomfort.

These headphones are great! For whatever reason, my ears are the wrong shape for many in-ear headphones (""earbuds""), unless they are incredibly small: after about 10 minutes of use, my ears are hurting so bad I can't wear them anymore. I've found that the solution for me is ""neckband"" headphones, where the electronics are stored in the neck band, and the earbuds can be extremely minimal.

These headphones are incredibly light-weight, fit comfortably in my ears, and have enough battery life to get me through any task I've used them for. The microphone is good for phone calls, though it picks up a good deal of background noise (FYI, in case you're trying to talk while you do something semi-noisy in the background). The build quality is all what you would expect from Sony, who have been making consumer electronics as long as I've been alive.

They have no ANC (active noise cancelling), but at the $20 price point I paid for them, that would really have been expecting too much.

The sound quality is GREAT _for what I'm doing_. I mainly listen to podcasts or make phone calls with them. I have only listened to a little bit of music with them, and do not consider myself an audiophile (let's blame minor hearing loss), so I can't comment on the quality of the bass, muddiness, or any of the other audiophile stuff.

My only complaint is that because the ""neckband"" is really just a cord, these can sometimes shift around as you are moving. I'm not sure I could recommend them for doing any kind of bouncing physical activity (plyometrics, cardio, sit ups, etc.) unless you have some way to hold them in place.

Overall I would definitely buy these again, but since they're from Sony I don't expect I'll have to any time soon."

Connects to my mobile quickly, Bluetooth and noise cancellation is fine. Sound is little less. Can't expect high bass; ; When I am using this product, it is getting pain in ear. After usage 10min and removed from ear, getting sound in the ear for next 1 hour. Even we don‚Äôt have option to return in Amazon. Just through aside.; Good quality hearing and very easy to use for pairing. Quality of the product is good and comes with outer box. Light on ear and very comfortable to wear it. Charging and battery level indicators features are good and gives comfortable level usage. The earbuds fits very comfortably for my ears and I am extremely happy for buying this product at a decent price; After using free hanging ear-pods, I decided to go for something that does not need regular adjustment on the ears to prevent them from falling or potentially losing them.

Sports style/over the ear TWS are not to easy find with a balance of form, feature and price. Edyell V2 hit the right mix.

Sounds quality is quite good. I found that sounds that usually get lost (like background music in a show/movie) are brought out well in these and with decent base. The balance between base and high frequency musical notes is good. Treble is clear.

Set up: Offers the latest BT connectivity. Setting up is easy. No struggles.

Battery back up is good. I have not stress tested it. But with 1-2 hours of use over 3 days, I still have about 60% battery left in the case from the factory charging that these came with. I am yet to connect the case to the charger.

I like the aesthetics of these TWS. Given these are over the ear, the packaging has been made as compact as it can be. The space within the charging case has been smartly used for two displays - charge in the case and charging status of individual pieces. The translucent black top and the matte bottom half look nice. The cover becomes functional as well when you notice that the individual ear pieces show a red ring light while charging which show through the cover.

These are light weight and so far I have not felt tired of wearing these.

The charging case, for safety, comes with a neat looking zippered case, that can be thrown in the laptop bag, purse or a sling.

Noise cancellation. I felt quite isolated from ambient noise while listening at 60-70% volume at home and in the open. Not tested these in really noisy environments. But I was really not hoping for ANC in these for this price point. Even PNC is good enough for me. Either way some isolation is there.

Overall, V2 offer a lot of feature and performance for the price. Thanks to all those who posted reviews of these. I had not heard of Edyell, but now I would recommend these to anyone looking for over the ear TWS.; Product is ok at this price slab, sound quality is good but has some minor connectivity issues. It didn't connect properly with my laptop and was frequently disconnecting. After trying all troubleshooting, I finally dropped my weapons. For mobile, it's working fine but remember, you get similar products at one-third price also. So, a bit disappointing at this price. The one and only advantage which keep these earbuds ahead of others is the ear-hooks, which are very useful while using during workout and outdoor activities. If you need only for indoor/travel purpose, you can explore many other options available in the market, I am sure you'll definitely save some bucks without compromising sound quality.; ; It's really a nice fitting earphones perfectly fits in ear. Sound quality is very impressive look's a little bit heavy but in reality weight is lower and also fills nothing after some minutes of use. Battery indicator is also a Cherry of the top . Charged very fast with my 33 watt charger. Overall a good products ."

In low cost enjoy music very nice loud.......
I purchased it Rs 599/- only.; I got it for 799/- within 24 hrs. Using it for 10 days now, don't have much complaints. I will sum up in pros and cons after my experience with the earphones. Reducing 1 star for the first CON in my review below.
PROS:
1) Cheaper than some of the other earphone brands with 12 months warranty as well.
2) Good Audio quality, I found it was better sounding than an Over the Ears Headphones I have from Cosmic Byte (G4000). Clear sound and good audio reproduction.
3) Battery life serves good at least for my taste as I am not a heavy user (I generally use it 2hours a day max.). Just FYI, I have charged the earphones twice in 10 days.
4) Comfortable earphones with very less weight and good ear fit.
5) Mic quality for calls is decent, not much noise cancellation for background noise but whatever is sent through is very clear and accurate.
CONS:
1) Biggest con for me personally is that I can't watch online youtube or twitch videos with this one (usually have to go 360p or lower for smoother experience) as it hampers the wifi speed on my mobile when connected to the mobile via bluetooth. This is happening because my wifi router is 2.4Ghz and it is interferring with the bluetooth signal to reduce internet speeds. A simple 5Ghz router would solve this issue, but as I don't have it, its become an issue. Also, I can tell if you run videos from mobile internet then you don't face this issue.
2) Only SBC bluetooth audio format supported hence not the best audio quality.
3) Left and Right ear plugs always confuse me while wearing it on, also the length of left and right side is not exactly the same, slight mismatch is present, which goes to show poor quality checks from the company.
4) Battery life could have been better or atleast charge time should have been reduced. It takes 1.5 hrs charge time for 6-8hrs battery life.
5) Battery indicator is very wrongly calibrated. From 100 to 70% discharging, it takes 5-6 hrs playtime, while from 70 to 10% it takes just 30 odd minutes. This again shows poor quality checks from the company.; i am using this last 4 years still its doesn't have any problem in sound ,bass, backup anything. Go for it. I love it.; Good overall; High price but average quality not very good not very bad; Overall performance is good and value for money product; Battery backup okay sound is clear but need vibrations when incoming call; This neckband is good quality is impressive build quality is also good but eartips and cable is missing from box . They forget to pack them . Otherwise this neckband is 4 star

Edit . I found eartips and cable actually they got dropped when I open it but this is not of use tips are small and big and cable has no quality even it does work yes the cable is not working
. So I would say battery backup is good . Bass is also good but calling is very very good . I can't expect that this earphones speak full number when call came .. value for money go for it"

Liked the place where buttons configured on the left cup and looks premium. Grey and golden makes it classy. Audio jack included and connects well. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.
Thank you very much,
Your customer Armaan."

Loudness: 5/5
No distortion even at higher volumes. Negligible distortion at 100%

Clarity: 4/5
No issue is there but the crispness could have been more.

Highs: 4/5
Mids: 4.5/5
Lows: 4.5/5

Comfort: 5/5
Fits perfectly. No issue even after using continuously for 5 hours.

Touch response: 4.5/5
There are minor lags in touch response which take some getting used to. Also you can't sleep with these on. The buds register ghost touches when it touches the pillow.

Bass: 4.5/5
Punchy enough, not blunt. But could have been more pronounced

Instrument seperation: 4.2/5
A regular user won't feel any issue, but as a audiophile the instrument seperation needs improvement. A better audio codec is required for a richer sound experience. But cannot complain in this price bracket. No tws in 1k price gives satisfactory instrument seperation.

Battery: 5/5
Buds last over 5 hours at around 60% volume.

Connectivity: 4.5/5
In the same room there is no issue in connectivity. In the next room, there are some rare minor hiccups. When you go two rooms across then there are some lags

Calling and Mic: 4.7/5
In indoor condition, superb experience. But when you are in a crowded street with too much honking or near a waterfall or windy area then you can hear clearly but the person on the other side can hear noise. Nothing to complain.

All over performance: 4.5/5
There are some areas for improvement, but this is a bang for bucks. The case is small and matte finish looks good. Comfortable buds. Sound quality is good. Call quality is good. If you want an affordable TWS you can definitely go for it. Its only competetor is truke, with better call quality. But the music and vocal quality on Noise Buds N1 is best under 1k.; I've been using the Noise Buds N1 for a few hours like 5-6 hours now, and overall, they are decent wireless earbuds. The sound quality is satisfactory with clear highs and mids, though the bass could be more pronounced. They fit comfortably in the ears and are lightweight, making them easy to wear for extended periods.

The battery life is good, providing around 4-5 hours of playback on a single charge, with the case offering additional recharges. The Bluetooth connectivity is stable, and pairing is straightforward. However, the touch controls can be a bit finicky and take some getting used to.

For the price, the Noise BUDS N1 offers good value, especially for casual listeners who want an affordable, reliable pair of earbuds. They're not perfect, but they get the job done for everyday use.; I recently purchased the Earbuds N1 and overall, I am quite satisfied with my experience. Here are my thoughts:

**Sound Quality:** The sound quality is decent, providing clear and balanced audio. Whether it's for music, calls, or podcasts, the earbuds perform well across various audio formats.

**Fit:** The fit of the earbuds is also good. They are comfortable to wear for extended periods without causing any discomfort, making them ideal for daily use.

**Connectivity:** One of the standout features is the fast connectivity. Pairing the earbuds with devices is quick and seamless, ensuring a hassle-free experience.

**Build Quality:** The only downside I found is the build quality of the case. It could be improved to match the overall quality of the earbuds themselves. The case feels a bit flimsy and could use a more robust construction.

**Conclusion:** Despite the minor issue with the case, the Earbuds N1 are a great choice with good sound quality, comfortable fit, fast connectivity, and a useful gaming mode. I would recommend them to anyone looking for reliable and affordable earbuds.; Advantages - very compact design, nice colour , build quality of specially buds is good , volume level is very high , sound quality is decent
Disadvantage - build quality of case is poor , the lead of the case is very unstable and feels cheap

My personal experience- I recied this product with broken seal , the lead of the case is very problematic; What I like about Noise Buds N1 is everything that I needed in earbuds it has provided like matfinish and strong build quality, i like the colour of this product so much, coming to the most important part the performance of the product so far I love the sound quality of the product and one can hear the bass of the audio very well; Audio is clear, mic quality is super,size are small, fast charging and easily to connect the mobile; Good quality, ease of use and high music audio with enough battery life; I have been using noise VS104 max for quite some time. And now this noise N1.
Noise always provides value for money product. The sound and bass quality is up to mark for this price. Although the microphone needs a bit improvement."

There is a mass of qualities in it.Value for money; very nice product and its sound; ok sound ok call quality, great build quality, poor service and connectivity

The sound profile has too much bass. if u only like heavy bass then you should go for it.

Battery life is mid , definitely not 32 hours. you can expect 16 to 20 hours to playtime.

call quality is mediocre. it gets the job done and handles background noise too but sometimes Bluetooth delay ruins the experience

Connectivity is awful. When you turn it on , it fails to connect to your already paired device and then u have to wait for it to try 2 times only to fail and manually connect it yourself.

build quality is excellent. the earpieces are metal built and the device feels solid as well.

service is mediocre as well since my unit got a problem of one side not working after 2 3 months and they do not offer door pick up. u have to courier your device or deliver it to the service centre urself. but i received my replacement device in under a week.; Quality of earphone and battery life is Ok. The earphone covers are not very good. Comes off easily and gets lost. Should have been better quality.; Excellent Quality. Performs well. Value for money.; Very good battery back,
I recommend to take this product; Sound is good; Call quality is very good but the strip of neckband is very small and bass is high but can be lowered using equalizer and the fitting is not good in my case (Everytime if one ear is fitting good then another is fitting loose or vice versa). Music quality is also very decent as I have used it now over 10 days.
I have attached a picture from where you can see the length of strip of neckband or you can see youtube reviews or go to a physical store."

I hope you find this helpful

Cons : quite a lot
1. The battery lasts for less than 4 hours. Battery drains almost immediately when it reaches 20%
2. The right side ear piece just keeps switching off intermittently even though it's fully charged.
3. Ear pain. Not comfortable at all.
4. Music isn't too good. It's ok for normal calls however not for music. Unsure why the manufacturer claims this to be a full range speaker.
5. Good for office calls like teams however takes a while to pair. You have to keep deleting the paired device and reconnect if you use it in mono mode.
6. It takes a little setting when you first connect else the other person will hear an echo or you sound like you are speaking from the end of the tunnel.
7. During a normal voice call (paired with the phone) during travel, the other person cannot hear you. It picks a lot of background noise.
8. EQ doesn't work
9. No option to mute and touch controls aren't too effective. Takes a lot of getting used to: not easy.
10. The biggest con i think is the charging port. Trust me, landing on the moon is easier vs trying to connect the charger. You just do not know whether the charging cable is connected the right way until you switch it on and see the LED flashing. The charging port is somewhat hidden which makes it difficult to identify which way the cable has to be connected. Plus the charging cable is so short! This was the biggest turnoff honestly.
11. It's been 4 weeks and already the outer color
of the pods has faded. Unsure how will it look after a month's usage and don't really know how long will this last. Mind you; i only use this indoors and that too for office calls only.

Pros:

1. Amazing noise cancellation : you cannot hear any noise if you plug this well in your ear. However be prepared for annoying earaches even at low volume
2. Works in both mono and stereo mode
You can pair multiple devices and connect L+R seperately (Please note that you may need to delete and re-pair the device frequently)
3. Operating distance approx 15 feet after which the pods either disconnect or no audio captured.
4. The box has breathable LED LIGHTS that flash for about 5-10 seconds everytime you open/close the lid or try to charge

To summarise:
It's okay if you want to use this for your office calls however be prepared to keep charging it every 3-4 hours. Does not last as long nor sounds good as advertised. What ever you do please do not take a white piece, it gets dirty very fast. Unfortunately my return period has lapsed and I'm stuck with this!

I hope you find this review is helpful.; the looks is absolutely fabulous. the rgb lights are worth looking but cant be customized and the buds dont have rgb light. it only blinks in blue color when its connected but not playing any sound. the case goes in breathing mode while charging which looks great but major drawback is you cant know the battery level. battery backup of buds is good but the case dont seem to have good battery backup. 40ms is good for gaming. and enx technology is just a gimmick. rest built quality is good enough.
if you have higher budget go for mivi Q9 gaming buds it has customizable rgb both is buds and the case unlike immortal series; It is good product from boat and got good battery life, volume control, good fit, features and connectivity.; The earbuds are very well placed in the ear, the bass is average except this everything is great.; "

UI:
Power On. Hold the center button for 2 seconds and the earphones with say in a Japanese/Indian woman's voice, ""power On, battery about 70%"". She does not sound Chinese like the cheap Chinese headphones. Her voice volume level is not very high either.

BT pairing:
Turn off the headset, press and hold to center button but keep holding the same button. The headsets voice will say, Bluetooth pairing"". Once connected, it will say, ""Bluetooth connected"". If BT disconnects, the voice says, ""Bluetooth disconnected"".

Next track:
Press and hold the + button for 2 seconds and the headset will make a cute ""chime"" and load the next song in the playlist of any app. I like this feature of the chime because this way I know the headset has accepted the command and loading the next track. However, holding the button for 2 second everytime you want to change songs can get annoying and painful if you want to skip a couple of songs of just skipping endlessly waiting for the right song to play. Buttons aren't very soft but do have a tactile click to ensure you feel the click when pressed.

Power off: just like power on, hold the center button for 2 seconds and the headset will turn off.

Volume up/down: No audible feedback, just volume increase or decrease.

Status LED:
Blue: when On and slow blinking when connected to bt. When in pairing mode, the same light blinks quickly in the same blue colour.

Orange: while charging. Solid on.
Green/off: 90% and above.

Physical clues: tiny nub on the left ear plug to denote left side. Only reputed brands have it.
Same tiny bump is made in the volume up button on the controller to denote volume +.
Coloured Dots on the plastic controller to denotr left and right channel.
Ear plugs are colour coded and fit very well in my ears. Most of the ear plugs fall out of my ears while talking. These don't. I use the smallest one.

What does Sony offer?
A very neat guide on how to insert the ear plugs in your ears the most comfortable way and ensure the best seal for clear audio. I've never known that you can pull you ear up from the top corner and gently place the ear plug into your ear canal. Once placed comfortably, drop the ear and let the ear canal seal in.

Audio App. It's basically a music player designed to detect the sony earphones. If you use spotify you can use this app to setup an equaliser. It plays MP3 from your storage too. My phone already has a built in Equalizer. I don't use any eq because the sound stage on these is flat. So all types of audio sounds great.

FAQ
Is it flimsy?
No, but feels like you might damage it if you're not careful.

Does it really last 25hr?
Yes, I've tested it sort of. And never managed to run out of battery.

How much did you spend on it?
1.6k

Audio lag?
None. I tested it with Android TV, LG web os, Android phone, ps4 and iPad. No issues of lag or disconnection or audio drop on super quiet moments of the song.

Bass?
Very decent and controlled.
Vocals?
Very clear
Treble?
Sharp and crisp.
Loudness?
You can listen at full volume without much discomfort. But I'd suggest not to.

I compared it with JBL wave tws100. The sound is very similar but a we bit less bass on flat eq.
80% Better than boat airdopes.
30% better than OnePlus bulletsZ.; I will just sum it up, Sony delivers in quality on all fronts, good battery,good bass,clear sound, comfortable, good connectivity,good mic and the sound overall is Rich. Only thing i am concerned about is the quality of material used on wires,very soft and lean, somehow i feel like the material isn't durable even though after almost 4 months, it's still new and strong.; I purchased this item, trusting the brand value of Sony. But so far this is the poorest quality sound I have ever experienced in any earphone. Utterly disappointed. To be honest it sounds like a cheap road side earphone. No bass at all. No high sound even if you keep max volume. Total loss for the amount. I have used Boat and JBL earlier and they are much better compared to this cheap product. Also no magnet for earpieces. Weak quality.; I am an old customer of sony, but I was confused about this product due to the reviews. But it is what actually I want, according to sound it lacks volume but soundstage is good, trebles work perfectly, vocals are clear, bass is soothing and deep. I like the integration of application which tells me my listening hours and set an equalizer according to my preference. I don't know much about DSEE upscaling but it makes a difference, listening to these earphones feels like listening to wired earphones with no lag and weird sound upscaling which other TWS does. Build quality will be a concern for rough users but not for me, it is pretty good for me. The neck part is not stiff which makes it easy to carry. I am a designer, According to a designer's perspective I would it has attention to details like the left and right are separated even with a color difference. Although, I didn't like the long press to change controls system and its not customizable. These earphones are waterproof and have sufficient battery life to support through my busy weeks. Also we can change the language of the instructor of earphones, I chose Japanese because I am a big fan of anime. Also the buds are non magnetic, but it dosen't creates much problem. At last buy these only when you aren't a rough user and wants high volume.; I once carried it in my backpack along with my smartwatch. I don't know if this caused any signal interference but it just doesn't work properly after that. For now, it works if you bring your phone 1 cm close to the antenna (the small rectangular box on the left) but if you place your phone on the table or keep it in your pocket, it stops working. So it's just pointless to use it anymore.

I don't know if this is something common with Bluetooth headphones, neckbands, and all. But I don't think this should have happened. Something is wrong with these products. I'd better stay with wired headphones to avoid the frustration of wireless gadgets.

The sound quality, the app support, the battery and the design are so good. You can buy it if you want a cheap and quality neckband. But just don't keep it near other Bluetooth devices.; Tive dois WI-C200 que duraram 4 anos, √≥timos, e acredito que s√≥ duraram 4 anos porque era usado no sol e no suor.

O fone queimou com apenas 15 dias de uso. Estava usando para estudar e do nada parou e n√£o ligou mais. J√° coloquei pra carregar e nem ali acende mais.; Really pleased with these buds. Exactly what I wanted. Sound is great. They fit well in the ear, and the cable is well balanced, so they don‚Äôt fall out unless they get snagged on something. And the battery seems to last forever. Good Sony quality.; TL;DR: These minimalist headphones from Sony do everything I need them to do, and I can wear them for hours on end with no discomfort.

These headphones are great! For whatever reason, my ears are the wrong shape for many in-ear headphones (""earbuds""), unless they are incredibly small: after about 10 minutes of use, my ears are hurting so bad I can't wear them anymore. I've found that the solution for me is ""neckband"" headphones, where the electronics are stored in the neck band, and the earbuds can be extremely minimal.

These headphones are incredibly light-weight, fit comfortably in my ears, and have enough battery life to get me through any task I've used them for. The microphone is good for phone calls, though it picks up a good deal of background noise (FYI, in case you're trying to talk while you do something semi-noisy in the background). The build quality is all what you would expect from Sony, who have been making consumer electronics as long as I've been alive.

They have no ANC (active noise cancelling), but at the $20 price point I paid for them, that would really have been expecting too much.

The sound quality is GREAT _for what I'm doing_. I mainly listen to podcasts or make phone calls with them. I have only listened to a little bit of music with them, and do not consider myself an audiophile (let's blame minor hearing loss), so I can't comment on the quality of the bass, muddiness, or any of the other audiophile stuff.

My only complaint is that because the ""neckband"" is really just a cord, these can sometimes shift around as you are moving. I'm not sure I could recommend them for doing any kind of bouncing physical activity (plyometrics, cardio, sit ups, etc.) unless you have some way to hold them in place.

Overall I would definitely buy these again, but since they're from Sony I don't expect I'll have to any time soon."

1. Really long battery life - one charge would last me a week of regular use.
2. Sturdy build - I move around pretty roughly and the never saw the wires tearing anywhere even after 2 years
3. Decent sound - I am not an audiophile. Don't know much about trebble, bass, highs, lows. The sound was good.

Cons:
1. Once the battery percentage is below 20, you can't listen to music as it keeps shouting ""Oops! Battery low"" every five seconds. This was the most irritating part and kept me wondering why it is even there.
2. It picks a lot of noise while calling if you are in a slightly busy space like office, or road. So not meant for calling
3. The rubber grip that helps to hold it in place came out easily as it would rub against my bag. Since then, I couldn't use it properly as the earphones would fall off.; This is product is very impressive with many fuctions like sound quality and it's durability of battery power. Service is also nice to reach to the customer. At this range they value for your money. Also light weighted product to feel comfortable.; Overall bass and treble balance is good, and music is good. Battery life is excellent, Icharge it once every two weeks. What I don't like is that the right side is heavier than the left side for the additional control switch present, which add to weight. Except this, its a very good product.; Just received the product. Yet to use for some time before I can give a detailed review. At the outset, product seems good. But I was very put off by the poor quality of the USB-C Cable. It does not work. Tried calling Amazon to report this, but only got automated messages with a promise to call back in one minute which did not happen! I hope to receive a replacement USB-C Cable of better quality which works well. This is a small accessory but the poor quality is tarnishing the name of a good brand like BoAT. Very sad!; I am posting this review after i am using ut for 1 month, see everything is good sound, battery, noise cancellation.
But the most worst thing is those 2 hook like structure which makes your earbud fix to you ear sp it won't fall but after 30 min u will feel pain in the where it stucks, and after like 1 hrs it gets worse. So main. Problem is those little outbreak on earpiece.
Rest is good in this price I don't see any change in sound after changing the mode. But everything is balanced.
If you are talking about calling experience it is good not best but good.; 1. The Product Was Good,Without Any Damage.
2. The Earphones Battery Was Insane, Nearly 2Weeks Without Charge.
3. The Earphones Has Good Durability,Water Resistance.
4. The Price Was Really Ok,Good.
5. The BeastXp Mode Was Really Nice,Noise Cancellation Was Good,Low Latency Was Ok.; Durability - The only negative point and the biggest issue is the durability. I bought this neckband in Nov 2023 and in 6 months, one of the ears has stopped working. This is the standard issue of all Boat earphones.
Sound quality - Great sound quality. I can easily differentiate between the different layers of music. Audio is also clear. Never had an issue with hearing. Even the microphone is good.
Battery life - Great battery life! I have charged the band only a few times. Even after using 4-5 hours every day, I didn't need to recharge the battery for the whole week.; Nothing spectacular but will get you through the day. Sound quality is average no noise cancellation but that can go by without noticing . Durability is surely a plus one. Light weight . No complains so far."

Sound Quality: The standout feature of the Ptron Bassbuds duo is their audio quality. The bass response is punchy and powerful, as the name suggests. For bass enthusiasts, these earbuds won't disappoint. However, the bass isn't overpowering and still maintains a good balance with the mids and highs.

Connectivity: Pairing the Bassbuds duo with my smartphone was effortless, and they maintained a stable connection with minimal dropouts during use.

JBL vs Sony XM5

Audio Quality: Its up to your preference. They both have a different sound signature. I found JBL offering more clarity in terms of music experience and if you switch to Sony right after JBL you'll feel there's some compression or processing being done. As an example - if these both were a glass window, you'll feel that there's a 90% transparent film on XM5 vs no film on JBL.

Standalone you'll like both they are really good also you can adjust audio to your liking in both. One thing in favor of JBL is that it has a personalized sound setting - it can't be a deciding factor but it boosts frequencies basis your preference and it does make a 10-15% difference in music experience.

Noise Canceling: Both are at par, XM5 may be slightly better but not by a huge margin. You'll still hear some noises inside both headphones. Maybe you'll hear more Hmmm noises on JBL and more Grrr noises on XM5. That being said there's not really a huge difference when you look at the price.

Noise Canceling on Calls: Here JBL is better, I recorded a call where I switched between both these headphones side by side on the same call. There was a hissing noise from Sony's mic however JBL was super silent and surprisingly captured better depth.

App experience: Sony has really good app but there's a learning curve to it. JBL on the other hand has a simplest app, just click on the few things and you are sorted. To put it in context - JBL app is like apple iPhone simple UI, let's you do your stuff and you wont be lost, Sony's app is like Android - you have lots and lots of options and you'll probably use 5-10 settings max but you can get lost.

Why is JBL not Popular then?
It doesn't mean it is not good, there's some catching up to do by the marketing team.

Why are there so many negative comments?
I have no idea, because of those comments I wend to check the device at store and bought it later.

Shall I buy it then?
of course, try to look for discount better offers negotiate with the sales person. Usually XM5 are available around INR 22K best price and these you should aim for 19K as best price on sale.; Clear sound quality with good comfort. I recommend to those who want to listen for long hours.; ; These are the best headphones you can buy under 25k. The noice cancellation is great also the call quality is good. The customization options available in the app makes it sound better.; Volume is extremely slow cannot enjoy the song played performance is not up to the mark; First impressions is just wow, soo soft and light weight while wearing; Having used headphones of Sony ,Bowers and Wilkins,Senneheiser very much disappointed with the overall sound of JBL tour one m2. The sound stage is good , mids , lows ,high sound almost perfect but the volume is very very poor. It can't even compete with xm3 /xm4's when it comes to anc and sound. The app is clean and easy to use . Other features works well but very much disappointed with the volume; I have purchased it for around 20k on the day of release. The quality of sound is top notch, fits perfectly with no harm on longer use. Gets a bag to travel. Loved it; Achei excepcional a fun√ß√£o do ‚Äúnoise cancelling‚Äù. Muito simples de desativar para ouvir o som ambiente. Os controles ‚Äúhands free‚Äù com gestos e leves toques nos phones s√£o √≥timos. Agora o que realmente impressiona √© a qualidade do som. Estou ouvindo m√∫sicas que conhe√ßo h√° anos, e parecem ser novas grava√ß√µes, posso ouvir com precis√£o detalhes e nuances de instrumentos e voz que simplesmente n√£o conhecia. Parece caro, mas vale cada centavo investido.; Package was supposed to be delivered 3 days after I ordered it, but I received it after only a day.

Product is as described.; Bonjour,
Je ne m'attendais pas √† une telle qualit√© pour ce Casque JBL TOUR ONE M2.
La qualit√© des finitions est remarquable, pas de fausse note sur la pr√©sentation qui est de haute qualit√©.
La sacoche de transport fournie est vraiment de qualit√© sup√©rieur et le casque est vraiment prot√©g√© √† l'int√©rieur.
La Qualit√© Audio n'a vraiment aucun √©gal, que se soit pour la musique, ou pour les film √† la t√©l√©vision.
J'ai configurer Google Assistant tr√®s facilement et en toute simplicit√©.
Autre fonction pour moi tr√®s importante. Le fait de pouvoir r√©pondre tr√®s facilement √† un appel t√©l√©phonique, sans forcement avoir votre t√©l√©phone pr√®s de vous.
La fonction Anti bruit est vraiment de tr√®s bonne qualit√©.
L'application permet de personnaliser les r√©glages du Casque JBL TOUR ONE M2
Je ne peux que vous conseiller ce Casque JBL TOUR ONE M2; De bediening is eerst even wennen maar eens je het door hebt besef je ineens dat je een super toestel hebt. Je hoort alles van buitenaf terwijl muziek keihard staat en vooral... Je hoort ineens nieuwe dingen. Voor de rest zoek maar alles op er is veel over te zeggen.

In low cost enjoy music very nice loud.......
I purchased it Rs 599/- only.; I got it for 799/- within 24 hrs. Using it for 10 days now, don't have much complaints. I will sum up in pros and cons after my experience with the earphones. Reducing 1 star for the first CON in my review below.
PROS:
1) Cheaper than some of the other earphone brands with 12 months warranty as well.
2) Good Audio quality, I found it was better sounding than an Over the Ears Headphones I have from Cosmic Byte (G4000). Clear sound and good audio reproduction.
3) Battery life serves good at least for my taste as I am not a heavy user (I generally use it 2hours a day max.). Just FYI, I have charged the earphones twice in 10 days.
4) Comfortable earphones with very less weight and good ear fit.
5) Mic quality for calls is decent, not much noise cancellation for background noise but whatever is sent through is very clear and accurate.
CONS:
1) Biggest con for me personally is that I can't watch online youtube or twitch videos with this one (usually have to go 360p or lower for smoother experience) as it hampers the wifi speed on my mobile when connected to the mobile via bluetooth. This is happening because my wifi router is 2.4Ghz and it is interferring with the bluetooth signal to reduce internet speeds. A simple 5Ghz router would solve this issue, but as I don't have it, its become an issue. Also, I can tell if you run videos from mobile internet then you don't face this issue.
2) Only SBC bluetooth audio format supported hence not the best audio quality.
3) Left and Right ear plugs always confuse me while wearing it on, also the length of left and right side is not exactly the same, slight mismatch is present, which goes to show poor quality checks from the company.
4) Battery life could have been better or atleast charge time should have been reduced. It takes 1.5 hrs charge time for 6-8hrs battery life.
5) Battery indicator is very wrongly calibrated. From 100 to 70% discharging, it takes 5-6 hrs playtime, while from 70 to 10% it takes just 30 odd minutes. This again shows poor quality checks from the company.; i am using this last 4 years still its doesn't have any problem in sound ,bass, backup anything. Go for it. I love it.; Good overall; High price but average quality not very good not very bad; Overall performance is good and value for money product; Battery backup okay sound is clear but need vibrations when incoming call; This neckband is good quality is impressive build quality is also good but eartips and cable is missing from box . They forget to pack them . Otherwise this neckband is 4 star

Edit . I found eartips and cable actually they got dropped when I open it but this is not of use tips are small and big and cable has no quality even it does work yes the cable is not working
. So I would say battery backup is good . Bass is also good but calling is very very good . I can't expect that this earphones speak full number when call came .. value for money go for it"

It seemed interesting - and had something called DIRAC Opteo in it + ANC. So I thought I'd give it a shot.
First-day impressions - it's blown me away!

Exhaustive list of impressions:
1. DIRAC OPTEO: Balanced sound with punchy bass! Yeah, and not booming bass. It's so great and I'm quite surprised it sounds like something you'd expect at a higher price point.
1.1 Soundstage: As soon as the headphone is switched on, it starts in 'battery saving mode'. Once you turn on DIRAC Opteo mode, you can literally feel the space opening up. All the instruments feel individual and sound separated. Fireflies (by Owl City) sounds lovely and all the strings sway in the centre while the various zaps and buzzes surround you. It's really great for the price!
1.2 Treble and Mids: Clean and clear. The bass doesn't overpower them and feels just right. The vocals come out clearly and all the instruments don't interfere with it (Drive home by Steven Wilson sounds great!).
1.3 Bass: Punchy and tight. I love how it fizzles in 'Bonfire' (by Knife Party) and how it reverberates in 'Turn Down for what' (by DJ Snake). 'Breakin' a Sweat'(by Skrillex, Zedd) sounded tight and I discovered how well produced it is! Lovers of tight bass, this is your product!
2. Volume: It gets really loud. So loud that I can't listen to it at the highest setting. But if that's your thing, then you should know that the highs get pretty shrill at the setting, but the bass is still pretty clean and loud!
3. ANC: ANC is present, but won't drown everything out. It's a great add on but if you're looking for a headphone to make all sounds around you zero, then this won't do that. If you need to drown out some noise while you listen to your tunes, this will do the trick!
3.1 Ambient Sound mode: The opposite of ANC, it pulls in the outside noise to let you have a conversation. Again, you can't blast tunes at high volume and still have a convo, but you can listen with lower volume (near 25% volume) and hear things around you. If the ambient sound also increased as I increased volume, it would have been amazing.
4. Calling: Did a couple of calls. With no-noise, the other person said I sounded great! I took a couple of calls in a local grocery store (was pretty loud) and the other end had no issue hearing me.
5. Buttons: The button placement is easy and I didn't feel any issue getting used to the controls. The simple manual explains everything in 2 mins, so read once and you're good to go.
5.1 To note: The sound is best in DIRAC Opteo mode. Every time you turn it on, you have to double press the multi function button to turn it on. I'd have loved having it on by default. Also every time I turn it on, it plays a 3-4 second tune, which could have been shorter. (Imagine hearing it every time you turn the thing on. Ugh.)
6. Connectivity: Once I connected it to my phone the first time, it connects to my phone within 1-2 seconds of turning the earphones on.
7. Battery: It seems to last long! I've been using them for about 4.5 hrs and it's gone down about 20%. Cannot say anything more yet though.
7.1 When you take both the earphones out of your ears, it doesn't auto pause like some of the competitors. Annoyed that this was missed, would have saved so much more battery if they did this.
8. Build quality: I have a black version. It's made with good quality plastic and didn't feel heavy around my neck. It doesn't have metal anywhere, and it's quite simple. I think it looks decent.
9. Exercise: Need to test! Will update later.

In summary, an easy recommendation. If you can overlook the small issues, there's a great sounding, feature-packed and long lasting device here at a great price! 10/10 would definetely recommend!; I'm using this neckband since a year without any problem. It's good sound quality and long lasting battery life really justifies it's price .; ; Edit: Mic became useless within a month. Need to shout loudly to let other person hear me.

Original review:
Let's do away with the good parts first.
Build quality
Looks
Ear fitting
Microphone quality
ENx (the other side hears you clearly, with the noise around decently suppressed).
Ambient mode: lets your hear your surrounding as loud as without plugging it in the ears.
Battery backup (Just fine, 8-10 hours, including 4-5 hours of online meetings, calls).

Now the Not Good:
Battery: Expected a lot better. It's no better than a local Rs.250 neckband.
Bionic sound mode: Not completely useless, but makes it just 'bearable'. Without it you'd want to throw it away if you like music, not just an overly booming version of its bass alone.
ANC: This one again is not completely useless, but also not sufficient enough to call it 'decent'. Note that it's only for music or gaming mode. Has no effect over voice calls. ENx handles that (so the other person hears you, not the noise around you), and it seems to be present in non ANC models too, just as good.

The Bad now:
Sound quality: Loses 'Everything' in the music that is pleasant.
Charging cable: It's just a bad joke in the name of ""cable"". Just a 4 inch long flat cable piece, with the √Ä type USB head being iron not even steel. Sticks tightly with the magnet within the box.

The Very Bad:
Ultra ugly bass: Yes, some 'may' like its overdone, over booming, painfully over amplified bass, but I bet even the craziest of those can't stand it for more than half an hour. It simply overshadows Everything! Including simple voice calls! The voice of the other person sounds extra heavy.

So, practically, the cheapest wired earphone found on streets will have better audio quality if you want to hear anything other than the over amplified bass. I like bass, enjoy the deep bass in movies. But man! It's not what this one delivers. You can't enjoy music, or movies. Not sure what they consider it good for.

You also can't wear it in your ears for continuously 5-6 hours everyday. It'll start hurting, even at low volumes. So basically, it's only good for voice calls, and that too only because its microphone+ENx together are really good quality. Just use it during calls, online meetings, then immediately take it out of your ears, leave it hanging around your neck. Maybe keep one loosely plugged (that how I'm using it) to be aware of notification sounds.

If using it for work from home situations, you may have to charge it at least once everyday. Though it's charging is superfast even through laptop USB port."

Now trying to charge my S22 Ultra and iPhone 12 Pro max, the one another reject to charge and device force to remove the cable. Disappointed

Only one device u can charge at a time. Waste of money.

Recommendation: Definitely, No; Perfect replacement for my broken oneplus charger. I can say way better. Amazing purchase in this price range. Loved the tiny and compact shape."

Loudness: 5/5
No distortion even at higher volumes. Negligible distortion at 100%

Clarity: 4/5
No issue is there but the crispness could have been more.

Highs: 4/5
Mids: 4.5/5
Lows: 4.5/5

Comfort: 5/5
Fits perfectly. No issue even after using continuously for 5 hours.

Touch response: 4.5/5
There are minor lags in touch response which take some getting used to. Also you can't sleep with these on. The buds register ghost touches when it touches the pillow.

Bass: 4.5/5
Punchy enough, not blunt. But could have been more pronounced

Instrument seperation: 4.2/5
A regular user won't feel any issue, but as a audiophile the instrument seperation needs improvement. A better audio codec is required for a richer sound experience. But cannot complain in this price bracket. No tws in 1k price gives satisfactory instrument seperation.

Battery: 5/5
Buds last over 5 hours at around 60% volume.

Connectivity: 4.5/5
In the same room there is no issue in connectivity. In the next room, there are some rare minor hiccups. When you go two rooms across then there are some lags

Calling and Mic: 4.7/5
In indoor condition, superb experience. But when you are in a crowded street with too much honking or near a waterfall or windy area then you can hear clearly but the person on the other side can hear noise. Nothing to complain.

All over performance: 4.5/5
There are some areas for improvement, but this is a bang for bucks. The case is small and matte finish looks good. Comfortable buds. Sound quality is good. Call quality is good. If you want an affordable TWS you can definitely go for it. Its only competetor is truke, with better call quality. But the music and vocal quality on Noise Buds N1 is best under 1k.; I've been using the Noise Buds N1 for a few hours like 5-6 hours now, and overall, they are decent wireless earbuds. The sound quality is satisfactory with clear highs and mids, though the bass could be more pronounced. They fit comfortably in the ears and are lightweight, making them easy to wear for extended periods.

The battery life is good, providing around 4-5 hours of playback on a single charge, with the case offering additional recharges. The Bluetooth connectivity is stable, and pairing is straightforward. However, the touch controls can be a bit finicky and take some getting used to.

For the price, the Noise BUDS N1 offers good value, especially for casual listeners who want an affordable, reliable pair of earbuds. They're not perfect, but they get the job done for everyday use.; I recently purchased the Earbuds N1 and overall, I am quite satisfied with my experience. Here are my thoughts:

**Sound Quality:** The sound quality is decent, providing clear and balanced audio. Whether it's for music, calls, or podcasts, the earbuds perform well across various audio formats.

**Fit:** The fit of the earbuds is also good. They are comfortable to wear for extended periods without causing any discomfort, making them ideal for daily use.

**Connectivity:** One of the standout features is the fast connectivity. Pairing the earbuds with devices is quick and seamless, ensuring a hassle-free experience.

**Build Quality:** The only downside I found is the build quality of the case. It could be improved to match the overall quality of the earbuds themselves. The case feels a bit flimsy and could use a more robust construction.

**Conclusion:** Despite the minor issue with the case, the Earbuds N1 are a great choice with good sound quality, comfortable fit, fast connectivity, and a useful gaming mode. I would recommend them to anyone looking for reliable and affordable earbuds.; Advantages - very compact design, nice colour , build quality of specially buds is good , volume level is very high , sound quality is decent
Disadvantage - build quality of case is poor , the lead of the case is very unstable and feels cheap

My personal experience- I recied this product with broken seal , the lead of the case is very problematic; What I like about Noise Buds N1 is everything that I needed in earbuds it has provided like matfinish and strong build quality, i like the colour of this product so much, coming to the most important part the performance of the product so far I love the sound quality of the product and one can hear the bass of the audio very well; Audio is clear, mic quality is super,size are small, fast charging and easily to connect the mobile; Good quality, ease of use and high music audio with enough battery life; I have been using noise VS104 max for quite some time.

Its performance is worth the price Highly recommended!""; I recently got my hands on the Ptron Bassbuds duo, and I must say, they have been quite a pleasant surprise.
As a budget-conscious consumer, I was initially skeptical about their performance, but after putting them to the test, I'm impressed with what they offer for the price.

Sound Quality: The standout feature of the Ptron Bassbuds duo is their audio quality. The bass response is punchy and powerful, as the name suggests. For bass enthusiasts, these earbuds won't disappoint. However, the bass isn't overpowering and still maintains a good balance with the mids and highs. The overall sound signature leans towards warmth, which makes them ideal for genres like pop, hip-hop, and electronic music.

Connectivity: Pairing the Bassbuds duo with my smartphone was effortless, and they maintained a stable connection with minimal dropouts during use.

Overall good.
In bluetooth field... Sony is doing decent job.
Owned sennheiser hd599 &beyerdynamic 770 so no comparisons
But first time using wireless +ANC headphones and happy to say sony has done a fantastic job.
Providing good++ value for good enough price.; I recently purchased this headphone and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is truly remarkable, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience that brings my music and podcasts to life. Whether I'm jamming to my favorite tunes or engrossed in a podcast, the clarity and depth of the sound are truly impressive.

One of the standout features for me is the microphone's noise cancellation capabilities. While it may not completely eliminate all background noise, it does a commendable job of reducing ambient sounds during calls. The result is clear and crisp communication without the distractions of external noise. It's perfect for virtual meetings and online gaming sessions where effective communication is key.

The design of the headphone is sleek and comfortable, making it suitable for extended wear. The over-ear cups provide a snug fit without causing discomfort, and the adjustable headband ensures a customized and secure fit. The build quality also feels robust, indicating durability for everyday use.

I appreciate the user-friendly controls that allow me to adjust volume, skip tracks, and manage calls effortlessly. The Bluetooth connectivity is reliable, providing a stable connection with my devices without any noticeable lag.

Overall, this headphone is a solid choice for anyone seeking a combination of excellent sound quality and decent noise cancellation. It strikes a great balance between performance and affordability, making it a valuable addition to my audio gear. Highly recommended!; Bought for like 6.8K during the Republic Day sale. Worth every penny you pay for. Used these for a week and here's the experience:

Pros:
1) Beautiful quality bass despite the price point.

2) Sony is just Sony, sound quality is 100% even at the highest of volumes.

3) Insane battery life, even with the ANC on.

4) Super light-weight (approx 190g) and extremely comfy foam pads. Easily can listen for hours together.

5) Figuring it out how to connect took me a few minutes, but after that no issues at all. Just instant Bluetooth connection with any device.

The only con:
1) ANC is kinda poor, and it's understandable cause they have to differentiate the XB910N from the CH720N. So it doesn't really affect my rating.

Bottom-line, if you're looking a pair of excellent headphones below 10K just go for these. You can't wrong with a pair of Sony headphones.; Title: Exceptional Performance, but No Carry Case Included

‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Having recently acquired the Sony WH-CH720N headphones, I've been thoroughly impressed with their overall performance. The noise-canceling feature is effective in creating a peaceful listening experience, whether I'm on the go or immersed in a noisy environment.

The sound quality is top-notch, offering a well-balanced and rich audio profile. The bass is impactful without overshadowing the mids and highs, ensuring an immersive and enjoyable listening experience. The wireless connectivity is convenient, and the battery life easily meets the demands of long flights and extended usage.

Comfort is a priority for me, and the WH-CH720N excels in this aspect. The plush ear cushions and adjustable headband make these headphones comfortable for prolonged use. I've worn them for hours without any discomfort, making them ideal for extended work or entertainment sessions.

The touch controls on the ear cups are intuitive and responsive, allowing for seamless navigation through tracks and volume adjustment. The built-in microphone delivers clear voice quality during calls, adding to the overall versatility of these headphones.

One notable downside, however, is the absence of a carry case in the package. While the headphones themselves are durable, a dedicated case would have been appreciated for added protection during travel and storage.

In summary, the Sony WH-CH720N headphones offer an exceptional blend of performance, comfort, and convenience. Despite the lack of a carry case, they remain a solid choice for those seeking reliable wireless headphones with effective noise cancelation.; Bom cancelamento de ru√≠do e fone leve para usar por bastante horas; I recently invested in the Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations on multiple fronts. As an avid music lover and someone who appreciates a good pair of headphones, these have quickly become my go-to choice for a premium audio experience.

1. Comfortable Ear Coverage:

One of the standout features of these headphones is the generous size of the ear cups. They provide excellent coverage, enveloping my entire ears in a cocoon of sound. The over-ear design not only enhances comfort during long listening sessions but also effectively isolates ambient noise, allowing me to immerse myself completely in the music.

2. Superior Noise Cancelling:

The noise-cancelling technology on the WH-CH720N is simply outstanding. Whether I'm on a noisy commute or working in a bustling cafe, the headphones create a tranquil listening environment by effectively blocking out external disturbances. The adaptive nature of the noise cancellation ensures a seamless transition between different environments, providing a truly immersive experience.

3. Impressive Battery Life:

Battery life is a crucial factor for any wireless headphone user, and Sony has delivered in this department. The WH-CH720N boasts an impressive battery life, providing hours of uninterrupted music playback on a single charge. This is perfect for long flights, road trips, or simply when you don't want to worry about constantly recharging your headphones.

4. Seamless Wireless Connectivity:

Setting up the wireless connection was a breeze, thanks to the seamless Bluetooth pairing. The headphones quickly connect to my two devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance. The freedom of movement that wireless functionality offers adds to the overall convenience of these headphones.

5. Crisp Sound Quality:

Of course, none of these features would matter if the sound quality wasn't top-notch. Fortunately, the WH-CH720N delivers crisp and clear audio across various genres. The bass is punchy without being overwhelming, and the mids and highs are well-balanced, providing a rich and detailed listening experience.

6. Enhanced Experience with the Headphones App:

What sets the WH-CH720N apart is the fantastic user experience provided by the Headphones app. The app allows for easy customization of sound settings, enabling me to tailor the audio profile to my liking. Additionally, firmware updates and additional features are seamlessly delivered through the app, ensuring that my headphones stay current and optimized for the best performance.

In conclusion, the Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones have proven to be an excellent investment. The combination of comfort, noise cancellation, battery life, connectivity, and sound quality makes them a standout choice in the crowded market of wireless headphones. If you're in the market for a reliable and immersive audio experience, these headphones are definitely worth considering.; I have spent years fighting to find a decent pair of bluetooth headphones since no phone manufacturer wants to make a decent phone with a jack anymore (which is endlessly stupid, but I digress). I have tried everything form fancy expensive Galaxy Buds to a myriad of budget options, and all have the same problems. Flawed connectivity, noticeably glitchy, slightly reduced sound quality.

These finally fix it. The inclusion of an option to use a headphone jack on devices that let you is a great feature. Along with multipoint connect. They fit perfectly around my skinny neck (your mileage may very on that), so travel with them is a breeze. And for the sound quality, these are absolutely the best headphones for your money.

I was loathe to go to overears full time because I like being able to take one out to hear my surroundings, and every noise passthrough I used before was sucky. (usually the outside noise obnoxiously trebley). Not with these. I actually go to concerts to listen with my headphones on because it actually makes the concerts sound better than with no headphones. Extremely convincing, near perfect noise passthrough.

The app is easy to use and has a great selection of features: from custom EQs, to adjusting the noise pass through, to other various quality of life settings. The 3D adaptive sound feature is great, though a little tricky to set up at first, and noise cancellation is very good, though not the best in the world. The battery life is also almost unbelievable. I use these headphones a lot--sometimes all day--and I still only have to charge them once or twice a week. Multipoint connection is also a very nice plus if, say, I am working at my computer and still want to be able to answer phone calls hands-free.

There are some minor flaws with them, though. First sometimes very low bassey notes from the outside world can trigger the speakers in them and give you very loud, deep popping noises. (E.g., this occasionally happens when I am riding in the car and hitting bumps in the road). Occasional outside sounds in passthrough through will sound muddled. Also the noise cancellation--while quite good--isn't perfect for every situation. Specifically, it has more trouble than, say, Bose headphones with loud, sudden sounds like fireworks. But for the money, it is still the best noise cancellation and passthrough system you can buy.

Another (minor) complaint, though, is that the adaptive settings aren't always very great. It often thinks I am sitting and automatically turns on noise cancellation when I am very much driving or walking around town or once even ice skating--all situations where passthrough is crucial. And even if I am sitting, sometimes I really want passthrough on (like if I'm in a cafe), but it automatically tries to turn noise cancelling on annoyingly. Thankfully, it can be easily overridden in the app. These days, I usually just keep the adaptive sound setting off and adjust the settings to fit the situation but sometimes it will randomly go back to automatic/adaptive mode.

My final and complaint is with the microphone for phone calls. Sometimes it works perfectly and the other line can hear my fine, sometimes all they can hear is background noise, sometimes they really can't hear me at all. I am not sure if it is some sort of firmware issue or if the microphone placement is just too far from my mouth, but for phone calls it can be a tad unreliable. When it works, which is around 75% of the time, it's perfectly good even though I have to talk a little louder than I normally would sometimes.

But all those flaws aside, these are probably the best all-around headphones I have owned and for the $120 I paid for them it's a steal. They may be more expensive as I got them on sale, but I have used headphones multiple times the price that are poorer quality and less functional than these. I'd have paid upwards of twice the price for what I got.; Couldn‚Äôt get the price here for them. They‚Äôre awesome for commuting and keeping the rest of the room quiet; There's alot to appreciate with this one. Priced well, the audio adaptability is great and comfortable to my ears!"

It is very surprising to see such good reviews for an below average product. I also stuck in this review trap.

Some negatives
Case shows 100% charged but on the phone it shows 60% charge
No reset button on the case
Right EarPod some how do not auto connect need to touch the pod to get it connected manually
No instructions on the box or manual which mentions how to reset or issue with right ear pod connection

Some Positives
Good look and feel
Good finish, looks rich
Quite light weight
Price under 1200/- seems reasonable

Need to check charging which is claimed as fast 5 min charge
Need to check 100 Hrs playback

I will republish my review in couple of days; Very very good earbuds fully value for money; I purchased yesterday and received defective items today. As per my understanding, this is from first batch. Not satisfied with this product it. I wouldn:t recommend to anyone purchase this 121 pro plus.; Sound quality is good

I was looking for a budget-friendly earphone with good sound quality and durability. I have to say that I am very impressed with this product. The earphone has a sleek design and a comfortable fit. The sound quality is excellent, with clear highs and deep bass. The noise cancellation feature works well and blocks out most of the ambient sounds. The earphone also has a built-in microphone and a multifunction button that allows you to control your music and calls. The cable is tangle-free and sturdy, and the earphone comes with a carrying pouch and extra ear tips. Overall, I think this is a great earphone for the price and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and affordable wired earphone.; Fits well in my ear, the build is good, esp. the wire is tangle free... Sound quality is good and works well. Haven't checked Noise cancellation feature yet; Good for music but not good for conversation. The mic quality is very bad. If the mic is held close to mouth also the voice is not audible to other person. Instead of noise cancellation voice cancellation is happening :-); Fit 10/10
Sound 10/10 ( Bass is not overpowered it is actually having a thump and good surrounding thanks to micro woofers inside, that's a clever implementation by boult I must say that because the micro woofers actually makes this earphone stand out in terms of bass that is of high quality)
Value for money -10/10 (this type of bass is seriously a treat to experience in 350‚Çπ segment I had the xiaomi dual driver and realme buds 2 too and I am telling you both have bass but the quality of bass in boult is rich followed by realme buds 2 which I feel has a overpowering bass but doesn't have surround effect like boult loop 2)
Mic : 10/10 ( quality is good and the provision of collar clip is a big plus to fix the mic position close to mouth. There are many earphones that have mic closer to the ear but with earphones that has mic in between often creates a distance that makes the talking a bit challenging as one has to hold it near mouth to be heard clearly but with the provision of collar clip this hassle is solved. So thanks boult for providing that collar clip its so helpful)

Conclusion: if you are music listener or a calling person, this covers both perfectly. And give the ""loop"" style, the fit is also perfect - not too tight nor too loose, just perfect. This type of quality in 350‚Çπ is seriously appreciable üëèüëèüëè.; I had ordered them in August and my initial experience was fabulous, but these earphones have a inbuilt flaw in them I think, because the material and construction looks durable from outside but and even after having no sort of physical damage and good handling one side started malfunctioning all of a sudden.

( This review might seem long but it is worth it. Boult asks it's employees to call the customers after a month for their reviews and asks us to write reviews, obviously they are positive because initially no one faces any issue and after a few months they cannot find their reviews to edit them. I found mine luckily so I am going to cover everything in detail.)

This review has date stamps of my experience and previous reviews to give you detailed idea of my experience.

17 SEP : my initial review
24 March : the issue arises
5 April : Final verdict

17 SEP :
Honestly I have been using these earphones since over a month now and I joyfully admit these have a very good sound quality. The earbuds fit in properly, cutting most of the noise. . I have tried mi, realme buds and boat and this one is clearly my choice.
Pros:
1. Proper fit
2. Clear sound at all levels
3. Good bass while still maintaining proper treble, mids and highs.

Cons:
1.loud even at least volumes
2. I experience static some times when the connector is at certain angle.
(Maybe it's just with my earphones ..this issue is not much of concern for me right now but if I face any problems in future I have already registered for warranty just to be cautious and I also got a call from their call center about quality of product and my experience, so I kind off hope they will be co-operative incase any issue occurs. I am very happy with these earphones .)

24 March:
The right side earpiece has started bugging me..it has loose connection all of a sudden now and I have to manually rotate the wire time after time to fix it. I am going to issue warranty if the problem increases which I am sure is going to happen very soon.

5 April :
As expected the right side has stopped working, so I called the customer care numerous times since past week, sadly, no reply came. I am disappointed in this brand seriously, they want good reviews and sales but they don't even answer customer care and warranty registration therefore is useless.

I don't think I am ever gonna buy wired earphones again, they all work good in the beginning and then they start malfunctioning after a few months, I have tried almost 5 brands now (MI, Realme, Boat, Boult, Motorola) and same experience has came to me every single time.; Overall the quality of the product is good üòä; I bought the Boult Audio Bassbuds Loop Wired in Ear Earphones with Mic with 12mm Powerful Driver for Extra Bass with Customizable Ear Loop and I am very happy with my purchase. The earphones have a sleek design and a comfortable fit. The sound quality is excellent, with rich bass and clear vocals. The mic is also decent and picks up my voice well. The wire is tangle-free and durable. The ear loop is customizable and helps to keep the earphones in place. The price is very reasonable for the quality and performance of these earphones. I would recommend these earphones to anyone who loves music and wants a good pair of wired earphones.; Got delivered on Jan 2, 2024 so 4 months into using and the right side is already without any sound. Initially the sound got lowered and now it's completely off. Quite disappointed with the quality & standard with respect to price. Used different brands all are actually same."

Galaxy Buds2 Pro run on Bluetooth v5.3 and are IPX7 water resistant.","I must say, I am thoroughly impressed with these earbuds.

Sound Quality (5/5):
The audio quality is exceptional. The sound is crisp, clear, and has a well-balanced bass. Whether I'm listening to music, watching videos, or taking calls, the Buds 2 Pro deliver an immersive audio experience.

Active Noise Cancellation (5/5):
The active noise cancellation feature works like a charm. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing me to enjoy my music without distractions. It's a game-changer for my daily commute and when working in noisy environments.

Comfort (5/5):
These earbuds are incredibly comfortable, even during long listening sessions. They fit snugly in my ears, and I never worry about them falling out. Samsung provides various ear tip options to ensure a perfect fit for everyone.

Battery Life (5/5)
The battery life is impressive. I can easily get through a full day of use with both the earbuds and the charging case. It's a relief not to constantly worry about charging them.

Connectivity (5/5):
Pairing and connecting to my Samsung device is seamless. The connection is stable, and I experience minimal dropouts. Plus, the Auto Switch feature is handy when switching between multiple devices.

Design (4/5):
The earbuds have a sleek and modern design. They're small and discreet, making them easy to wear without drawing too much attention. However, the glossy finish can be a fingerprint magnet, which is a minor drawback.

Voice Assistant Integration (5/5):
The integration with Bixby or other voice assistants is smooth and responsive. It's convenient to control music or make calls using voice commands.

In summary, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are a remarkable upgrade that delivers excellent sound quality, top-notch noise cancellation, and comfort for extended use. Whether you're a music enthusiast or need reliable earbuds for calls and productivity, these earbuds won't disappoint. My friends Amaranth AJ, Govind S, Bilal also tried these earbuds and they were really impressed with the buds. I personally will choose this earbuds to be the best earbuds that I have ever used till now. I will suggest anyone who wish to buy this product without any second thoughts.; It's been 4 days now and I thought of giving a nice feedback. The music experience has been so amazing and wonderful. This is the first time I'm using TWS with ANC enabled. I bought this on Great India Festival sale in 2023 for 7300 rs and it was a steal deal.

ANC: It totally restricts external noise but the sharp voice when someone suddenly starts speaking to you can't be restricted and that surpasses the restriction. As this was the first time I was using ANC, I was pretty much amazed how wonderful this tech is. It totally gives the right feel when listening to music and I don't think that I'll ever want non-ANC featured earphones/headphones anymore. After using these buds for 1 month, I can argue that sometimes the ANC feature doesn't work as good as the other times.

Touch control: these buds have so many features but I struggle hard when I've enabled double tap for both changing the music and controlling volume. Controlling volume is difficult to perform sometimes. You get an app for controlling them with a widget on your homescreen to turn off ANC and touch control and that widget is extremely helpful and needed app. Pixel buds have swipe gesture to control volume, maybe that feature will increase battery consumption more but it's more convenient than tapping. My worst experience was with volume control on these earbuds and I had to turn that feature off because this doesn't work satisfactorily.

Battery: With ANC enabled, I get around 4 hours of backup on buds and my case battery lasts for 2+ days. It doesn't take much time to charge. With ANC disabled I can use buds for 5+ hours.

Connectivity: I can use these buds on laptop and all my phones but not at the same time. if these are connected to one device, you'll have to disconnect to pair with other device. But it's not a big issue. You won't struggle with connectivity. Most of my devices are very old and they connect seamlessly.

24 bit and 360 degree audio: Not available for all devices, only work on samsung phones with latest ONEUI. These additional feautres are why these are costly. I don't find these features useful at all ‚Äî feel more like gimmicks to me. 360¬∞ audio is terrific, I haven't tested much but I guess you won't find this feature on any other TWS. If you don't require these features, you can go for buds2 if you don't have a budget.

Sound quality and bass: Sound and bass both are clear and balanced. You can hear details of every instrument clearly. The quality of sound is amazing and I have personally never had this experience with other earphones before.

Size, fitting and appearance: I don't know why some people criticize it for being too bulky, It's not really a big deal and easily fits in the pocket. Buds are great but you can't wear them for long time, they hurt ears if you keep wearing them for 3+ hours.

I can rate each feature individually now:
ANC: 8/10
Sound Quality: 9/10
Touch control: 7/10
Fit and finish: 8/10
Connectivity with different devices: 10/10
Battery: 9/10

Update after 6 months of use: The product's build quality is good, but Samsung is gradually reducing the sound quality with each update. The Buds2 Pro doesn't have its original audio signature anymore, for which these buds were once famous. The latest update has significantly impacted sound quality and increased treble which is hurting my ears. While there's a way to downgrade to older firmware but it's pointless that Samsung is doing this and it's not worth it considering the price you have to pay for these buds. I hope that Samsung rolls out new update with better audio signature and if it doesn't, then I'd suggest you go for other earbuds.; After trying out the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, I'm compelled to share my thoughts on these wireless earbuds.

Sound Quality: The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro deliver clear and balanced highs and mids, though the bass lacks depth and the sound stage could be broader. Instrumentation separation could also be improved, especially when compared to premium options like the Sennheiser Momentum 4.

Design and Comfort: The sleek and compact design of the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro is a noticeable improvement over previous models. However, I found them less comfortable for extended wear due to the shorter extending piece that fits into the ear. After around 30 minutes of use, discomfort and earache became apparent. A slightly longer design could greatly enhance comfort.

Comparison with Premium Headphones: When compared to premium headphones like the Sennheiser Momentum 4, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro offer similar sound balance at a fraction of the cost. While the Sennheiser headphones excel in providing a wider and deeper sound stage, as well as better instrumentation separation, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro hold their own in terms of sound quality and affordability.

Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): The ANC feature is decent but not exceptional. While it effectively reduces some background noise, it struggles to block out louder environments completely.

Overall Impression: The Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are a worthwhile purchase for their balanced sound and stylish design. However, improvements in comfort, sound stage, and instrumentation separation would undoubtedly enhance the user experience. If you're in search of budget-friendly wireless earbuds with good sound quality, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are definitely worth considering.; Ich nutze die Kopfh√∂rer nun schon einige Monate und habe bisher absolut keine Beschwerden. Sie lassen sich problemlos mit meinem Handy verbinden und verbinden sich automatisch, sobald ich sie raushole. (Wei√ü ich nicht ob das nur mit Samsung so ist oder auch mit anderen Marken)

Die Soundqualit√§t ist sehr gut.
Der Akku h√§lt lange. Obwohl ich sie h√§ufig √ºber mehrere Stunden an habe, sind sie noch nie w√§hrend des H√∂rens leer gegangen.
Sie sitzen sehr angenehm in den Ohren und st√∂ren keines wegs. Selbst wenn man sich im Bett seitlich hinlegt und mit den Ohren auf dem Kissen liegt, sind sie im Vergleich zu vielen anderen weiterhin gem√ºtlich.

Das einzige was meiner Meinung nicht allzu gut ist, ist die Ger√§uschunterdr√ºckung. Wenn man laut Musik h√∂rt und dazu Ger√§uschunterdr√ºckung an hat, funktioniert das trotzdem. Ansonsten h√∂rt man leider noch einiges von der Umgebung und kann nicht vollst√§ndig ausschalten.; Dopo un attenta ricerca sono arrivato alla conclusione che queste fossero le migliori cuffie a questo prezzo. Samsung tramite la collaborazione con harmann e akg sono riusciti a creare questo prodotto spettacolare. Qualit√† dell'audio eccellente, bassi veramente eccezionali. Unica pecca la funzionalit√† della cancellazione attiva dei rumori, che non √® alla pari di bose. Ma personalmente non la uso mai, preferisco la qualit√† del suono. Detto questo ovviamente funziona pi√π che bene la cancellazione dei rumori anche nelle cuffie samasung. √à solo l'unico aspetto dove mi sento di dire che un altro brand ha fatto meglio.; Buena calidad de sonido.
Muy c√≥modos al rato de llevarlos no se notan en la oreja
Cancelaci√≥n de ruido decente
Bater√≠a con cancelaci√≥n de ruido 6 horas y sin esta puesta alrededor de 8. El estuche vale para 3 cargas m√°s o menos
Se conecta muy r√°pido y la app de Samsung va bastante bien.
Los recomiendo, se sienten bastante premium; Ich nutze die Buds 2 Pro mit einem Galaxy S24 Ultra, die Konnektivit√§t funktioniert reibungslos.

Active Noise cancelling leistet gute Dienste, die Effektivit√§t ist etwas geringer als bei den Airpods 2 Pro, jedoch weiterhin als sehr gut zu bewerten. Durch l√§ngere Ber√ºhrung mit dem Finger aktiviert sich der Transparenzmodus, sodass man seine Umwelt oder sein Umfeld besser wahrnimmt.

Das Klangerlebnis ist subjektiv empfunden sehr gut. Die H√∂hen, Tiefen und B√§sse werden klar wiedergegeben, B√§sse klingen angenehm satt, ein verzerren kann ich in meinen genutzten Bereichen nicht feststellen.

Telefonie funktioniert wunderbar, man wird sehr gut wahrgenommen und sein Gegen√ºber h√∂rt man klar und deutlich.

Die Akkulaufzeit l√§sst bei mir als ""Vielnutzer"" keinerlei W√ºnsche √ºbrig. Habe die Buds trotz Netflix Session, Telefonie und Musik h√∂ren beim Rad fahren noch nie innerhalb eines Tages leer bekommen.

Die Verarbeitung des Cases und der Buds ist makellos. Aus meiner Sicht, stehen die Buds 2 Pro verglichen mit den Airpods Pro 2 in Sachen Klang und Verarbeitung in nichts nach, obwohl sie nahezu nur halb so teuer sind.

Zusammengefasst klare Empfehlung meinerseits, wenn man ein Galaxy Smartphone nutzt. √úber den Buds Manager hat man hier die meisten M√∂glichkeiten zur Einstellung.; Les essayer, c'est les adopter !

Je suis audiophile et vient d'un casque sennheiser, je suis habitu√© √† avoir un son propre et tres √©quilibr√©. Je cherchais avant tout des √©couteurs fid√®les dans la restitution audio, pour √©couter ma musique.

Apr√®s avoir test√© plusieurs mod√®les d'√©couteurs d√©cevants du point de vue audio, j'ai enfin trouv√© le mod√®le que je cherchais. Ces galaxy buds 2 pro sont une petite merveille et je p√®se mes mots.

Le son est parfait : bien √©quilibr√© d'origine (nul besoin de passer par un egaliseur) avec des basses magnifiques, rondes, parfaitement dos√©es contrairement √† bon nombre d'√©couteurs qui en envoient trop pour masquer la pi√®tre qualit√© des aigus et m√©diums... car oui les m√©diums et les aigus sont ultra pr√©cis et clairs dans ces galaxy buds 2 pro... la technologie a 2 transducteurs n'y est sans doute pas √©trang√®re car aucun transducteur ne peut restituer parfaitement les graves et aigus √† la fois.

Je d√©couvre par ailleurs avec stupeur l'efficacit√© de la r√©duction de bruit active que je consid√©rais comme un gadget jusqu'alors. C est incroyable √† quel point cela isole de l ext√©rieur : on est comme dans une bulle silencieuse, c est simplement g√©nial de pouvoir couper les bruits parasites de l ext√©rieur pour n entendre que sa musique... √ßa devient vite indispensable ! Je manque de points de comparaison sur l'ANC mais je constate que cela fonctionne tr√®s tr√®s bien.

Pour le reste, les √©couteurs sont confortables. Aucune g√™ne √† les porter longtemps. Les contr√¥les tactiles sont tr√®s biens... l application samsung genre est bien et permet de personnaliser les r√©glages.

En r√©sum√©, je recommande chaudement ces buds 2 pro. Ils valent largement leur prix et √† 130 euros c est un excellent rapport qualit√© prix !"

From its stylish design to its outstanding audio performance, it has exceeded my expectations in every way.
Design and Build:
The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek and modern design of the Boat Neckband. The combination of black and silver accents gives it a premium look, and it's incredibly lightweight, making it comfortable to wear for extended periods. The flexible neckband design ensures a secure fit around my neck, even during rigorous workouts or when I'm on the move.

Sound Quality:
The sound quality of these neckbands is nothing short of exceptional. The Boat Neckband delivers rich, clear, and well-balanced audio. The bass is punchy without overpowering the mids and highs, allowing me to enjoy a wide range of music genres with utmost clarity. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tracks or taking calls, the audio quality is consistently impressive.

Battery Life:
One of the standout features of the Boat Neckband is its impressive battery life. I can easily go through several days of moderate use on a single charge. This is incredibly convenient, as I no longer have to worry about constantly recharging them, making them perfect for long trips or days filled with back-to-back meetings.

Connectivity:
Pairing the Boat Neckband with my devices is a breeze. The Bluetooth connectivity is stable and quick, and I've had no issues with dropouts or disconnections. The device also has a decent Bluetooth range, allowing me to move around my home without losing connection quality.

Comfort and Convenience:
These neckbands are designed with comfort in mind. The earbuds fit snugly in my ears, and the neckband doesn't cause any discomfort, even during extended wear. The in-line controls are intuitive, making it easy to adjust the volume, change tracks, or take calls without reaching for my phone.

Call Quality:
The built-in microphone provides crystal-clear call quality. I've had numerous conversations, and the person on the other end has always reported that my voice comes through loud and clear, even in noisy environments.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Boat Neckband has proven to be an excellent investment. It combines style, comfort, and exceptional sound quality into one impressive package. Whether you're a music enthusiast or need a reliable hands-free calling solution, these neckbands deliver on all fronts. I wholeheartedly recommend the Boat Neckband to anyone in search of a top-notch wireless audio experience.; Noise cancellation ok, battery is good, sound quality ok, ok; Not worth for money. Can't hear clear sound and base; The two device pairing and simultaneous use on both the devices is a great feature when you don't want to constantly change devices using button or something. The sound quality is also excellent for the price. There are still two things that bother me. The feature of magnetic bus is kinda a gimmic, it doesn't turn the earbus on or off. But the feature of two device simultaneous pairing make up for it. Sometime when I turn the earphone on it doesn't seem to connect to my phone instantly, I have to manually do it and in other cases it perfectly does that. The other thing is build quality is okay, but can't argue for the price it's good enough. Only if they used rubberised plastic instead of textured one, would've had a better feel to it.; Less battery life; Been using it since a week and they're really comfortable. I got it delivered in two days without delivery charge and it's worth spending ‚Çπ1000 on. It's quality is really good. It has great battery life too since I noticed that it charged up in an hour and works for like 30 minutes with no disturbance.; A very good neckband with good sound quality and connectivity is also good.; This is so good but not well"

Firstly, the compact and lightweight design of the earbuds makes them easy to carry around. The charging case is pocket-friendly, providing additional battery life on the go. The earbuds themselves are comfortable, and their secure fit ensures they stay in place during various activities.

Sound quality is where the pTron Turbo TWS earbuds shine for their price range. The audio is clear, with decent bass and well-defined highs. While they may not compete with premium options, they deliver a satisfying listening experience for everyday use.

The touch controls on the earbuds are responsive and intuitive, allowing easy control of music playback and calls. Pairing with my device was seamless, and the Bluetooth connection remained stable during my testing.

Battery life is another area where these earbuds perform admirably. With several hours of playtime on a single charge, they easily get me through a day of casual use. The quick charging feature is a bonus, providing a convenient way to top up the battery when needed.

It's important to note that the pTron Turbo TWS earbuds may not have advanced features like noise cancellation, but considering their budget-friendly price, they offer excellent value for money.

Sound is superb however the price may be little bit on a higher side.; I have been using these headphones for 4 weeks and this is my review. I needed a good quality wireless headphone to connect to all my devices (Smartphone, Work MacBook & my Gaming PC), so I felt this one will do it.

Sound Quality: It is good for at this price range, has some good bass, I didn't find any problems with it. While gaming also it was great (I usually play story mode games, so I don't know how will it do on competitive games)

Build Quality: It's good for this price, but it could be improved, especially the headband region. I had some problems with buttons initially not registering the commands, but it's OK for now.

Battery: They claim 34 Hrs of Battery backup, and I am getting some 30-ish hours. Charges to full from 10% within some 3 hours.

Comfort: The Cushions is good, the headband was too tight in the 1st week, but it adjusted to my head size, so now it's OK. I use it like 4‚Äì5 hrs a day and continuously like 2 hours. Sometimes you have to remove and place it again to remove that irritation. I don't recommend this to people with big head size.

Connectivity: Supports up to 2 devices in Bluetooth & 1 wired connection. No issue & easy pairing.

App: There isn't much here, just an equalizer.

Mic: It's good quality and is clear, nothing much to say

The only thing I found very irritating was when I am listening to some music in my MacBook and my phone sends a notification tone, the music doesn't resume when paused, whereas it will after you hang up a call.

Overall, a good headphone. I liked it; These headphones are really cool no problem like latency while gaming because it has a app on mobile where you can swith to gaming mode; Horrible horrible product i bought it 8 months ago and it broke couple months ago. Then i bought the product again since previous one broke and i liked its look and it broke again in 2 months and they dont take responsibility for their poor product.; Buttons are very hard to press, otherwise a good purchase; The product itself is great with good sound quality, comfortable cushions, but the packaging was not good normally Amazon packaging is there based on product meaning for the box of headphones there would another box but this team it was not there even bubble wraping was not proper & Box of Headphones was damaged; Sound is amazing but roo small for me; Me encantan, m√°s porque al descargar la app de skullcandy te permite que mejores el sonido. Tambi√©n tiene para b√∫squeda en caso de que los pierdas. Y ya incorporaron el Jack para utilizarlo si se te descargan los aud√≠fonos. Si dud√© un poco envolver a adquirir este tipo de aud√≠fonos porque ya van dos que se me rompen y uno me dur√≥ menos del a√±o. Pero la verdad es que lo vi en promoci√≥n y los cuidare m√°s. Adem√°s quee ya tiene m√°s duraci√≥n de bater√≠a. Los compre en diciembre y solo los he cargado dos veces (es abril); Toller Klang und ei gutes Tragegef√ºhl.; Very good quality, sound system is very good , so many kids at school asked my daughter for the link to buy one to , is really good .; Me gustaron, son ligeros y se adaptan bien a m√≠ cabeza... Los pill√© de oferta, no me puedo quejar. üòÅ; DESIGN:
Belle, comodissime, coprenti interamente la superficie laterale del padiglione, ma leggere. Cuscinetti morbidissimi. Materiale del guscio dei padiglioni piacevole al tatto, come lievissimamente gommato (il lato negativo √® che trattiene facilmente le impronte, e pazienza). Regolazione asticelle efficace, non troppo dura, giusta.

FUNZIONAMENTO GENERALE E SUONO:
Funzionano abbastanza bene, si sentono bene.
Ogni tanto sul notebook, specie quando non √® molto carico, danno qualche segno di malfunzionamento, come se il bluetooth non prendesse bene, e il flusso audio risulta impreciso (a tratti pi√π veloce e a tratti pi√π lento poi ancora veloce... nel giro di pochi secondi). Devo ancora capire perch√© qualche volta si comportano in questa maniera. Il pi√π delle volte comunque funzionano benissimo tranquillamente.
Indossate, si sentono i suoni esterni, attutiti passivamente pochissimo, direi un 10-20%.

MULTIPOINT:
Il multipoint √® meraviglioso, velocissimo, credo il pi√π veloce che io abbia provato, comprese cuffie molto pi√π costose e blasonate. Il passaggio dal notebook al telefono √® praticamente istantaneo, mentre dal telefono al notebook spesso √® istantaneo, altre volte ci mette giusto un attimo, ma √® un'inezia.
Aumentando e diminuendo il volume dalle cuffie, viene regolato solo sul dispositivo in riproduzione, il che mi sembra un'ottima cosa; e non accade con tutte le cuffie."

Here are the key highlights that make these earphones a fantastic choice:

**Exceptional Sound Quality:** The Bombastic Bass is truly remarkable. Whether I'm listening to music or watching videos, the sound is rich and immersive. The audio clarity and depth are excellent, making every listening experience enjoyable.

**Fast Charging:** The fast charging feature is a game-changer. With just 10 minutes of charge, I get 20 hours of music playback. This is incredibly convenient for someone with a busy schedule. I never have to worry about running out of battery.

**Long Battery Life:** The 30-hour battery life on a full charge is outstanding. I can use the earphones for extended periods without needing to recharge frequently. This makes them perfect for long trips, workouts, and daily commutes.

**Comfortable Fit:** The in-ear design is comfortable and secure. The earphones stay in place even during rigorous activities, and I don't experience any discomfort even after prolonged use.

**Easy Connectivity:** Pairing the earphones with my devices is quick and hassle-free, thanks to Bluetooth 5.0. The connection remains stable, and I haven't encountered any dropouts or lag.

**Built-in Mic:** The built-in mic ensures clear and crisp call quality. It's great for hands-free calls, and the voice clarity is impressive.

**Stylish Design:** The Acoustic Red color is vibrant and stylish. The design is sleek and modern, adding a touch of elegance to my tech accessories.

Overall, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless In-Ear Earphones offer exceptional value for money. They combine excellent sound quality, fast charging, long battery life, and a comfortable fit in a stylish package. I highly recommend these earphones to anyone looking for a high-quality audio experience.; There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.

The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.
Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.

You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.

As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand‚Äôs audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.
If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.

That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.

They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.
The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.; One plus bullet is worth for money. Sound quality is amazing with clear voice feature. Design n material of product is worthy üôå. And got at best of it's price...so definitely no complaint at all.; Been using the Z series past 4 years was quiet satisfied but i was bit spectical about the Z2 ANC in terms of ear fitment and noise cancellation to my suprise its working too good and satisfied with the product and the cost price.; Sound is good everything is alright provided it is hard many times to connect neckband from Bluetooth,either I have to off it or forgot it and pair it again.
Product is of good quality, comfortable in ears and can use easily while doing other activities,battery is okay.Only problem is to connect it from android phone.; I bought this one because of the ANC, and i am quite impressed with the noice cancellation. Eartips are small though but not a problem i can buy it seperately. I was not expecting the sound quality because I use iem earphone as well but the sound quality is quite impressive, best for music like edm mix. Bass is impressive also. Not for music like classical but other than that it is good to listen other genres of music. Connectivity is quite fast and easy and switching between devices as well. Satisfied with battery life as well.; I charge it once a week and it works effortlessly. It‚Äôs very comfortable to use and the neck band is adjustable. I like the quality of sound and would recommend it. I use iPhone and it pairs perfect with it.; Good battery, good sound , call quality nice , gaming not good ,look ok.; The sound quality is very good. The battery life is outstanding. Best of all though is when you click the buds together with their magnets they turn off. Pull them apart and they turn back on. No button to fiddle with. All buds should be like this.; This brand is recognized becaus of the quality of its products and this item is not the exception. perfect for sports and outdoors activities.; La puntualidad, presentaci√≥n me gust√≥ much√≠simo; Good quality, little bigger the end of the neck band because of a bigger battery. Sound and noise cancelation better than previous model. Ear tips smaller and lighter, for me hold really good even running, better bass and treble.; Precis vad jag s√∂kte efter"

It'd been 10 days, it didn't discharged to zero. Although I tried charging it..so it went very fast. Amazing Noise Cancellation .It has Bluetooth connectivity with multiple devices and also got ox cable for wired connectivity. I highly recommend it, if you want to spend monet on great wireless headphone.; 1,Appearances is good, good fit perfect balanced weight goes smooth and easy over the ears. But too much or usage might get little warmth but that‚Äôs okay I must say.
2. Value for money : yes sounds good clear voice and all instruments but can‚Äôt expect too loud sound and heavy bass. Because it‚Äôs simply not designed for heavy musics.
3.connectivity it‚Äôs very much better in this devise. Well I‚Äôve seen some connection drops in the darker area (I.e phones in pocket, phone in the bag or in the glove box of a car) but not too bad I must say, it fights really hard and good to maintain good connection.
4.build quality & attention: build quality is fair I can say a bit of mettle and major combination of soft plastic and cushion makes it light and strong. And yes people will look at what your wearing they show some good attention.

Conclusion :Just had this gig for some days that‚Äôs all . So far so good I can say. But the way they build this and tech used in this it should easily last for about 2-3 years. But be sure to buy some extra warranty for 2 years or something. Because JBL are such a brand where they show the best in the day and hides the worst for the night. I‚Äôve experienced it before down the line after manufacturing warranty there will be some issues that gives you surprises. Later you wish to repair it or simply buy a new one would your hard choice to make.; I like this product for the value for money it provides. I've been using this headphone for the past week and I'm happy to report that my experience has been pleasant while using these for a person who's not a hardcore audiophile.

PROs:
(a) Comfortable over the ear fit for average ear size; headphones do not feel heavy over long use
(b) Over par, more than advertised battery life. Easily lasts a week with heavy usage and ANC turned off. And 3-4 days with moderate ANC usage.
(c) App support is amazing on android. Provides the following features:
(i) Active Noise Cancellation
(ii) Ambient Noise Aware
(iii) Talkthrough
(iv) Self voice aware volume control
(v) Equalizer support (bass, extra bass modes pre-configured - +ve experience using them)
(vi) Separate Audio and Video modes for consuming content
(d) Almost negligible noise bleed
(e) Solid build quality. Tactile buttons. Travel friendly (foldable ear cups)

Some minor CONs:
(a) ANC could be better. Not very strong ANC
(b) Button placement could be better
(c) Foam in the ear muffs is built to last and not comfy if cups lay over your ear cartilages for long duration (if you have bigger ears).
(d) dark blue colour just looks horrendously cheap in daylight as outside shell material is plastic. Go for black, white or purple (if it ever comes back in stock); The ear pads are too small .. they hurt after few minutes of usage .
There was a weird line that looks like a crack on the side of the headphones and this isn't only on my product.
The Bass of the headphones is trash as well. The headband is tight and if extended they float over the head instead of resting when extended. The build quality of the Headband is as good as the Boat771 feels like it'll snap. Overall I'd rather the Boat 751 more then the JBL 770 In terms of Bass, Comfort, vocals .. the only up this headphones got over the Boat751 is the Noise cancellation.. which isn't even that good.
These headphones aren't worth 6k at all; Pros:
+ Super audio quality pretty much at all frequency level
+ 10 meter Bluetooth range with quick pairing
+ Better microphone quality
+ Better noise cancellation
+ Super battery life
+ Companior app to adjust audio mode and equalizer
+ Appropriate packaging
+ On-time delivery

Cons:
- Little costlier; ; Everything is fine except for the crackling sound that occurs during calls üìû, which happens consistently in every call. This makes me frustrated, honestly. However, other than that, normal audio sounds good and has quality.
One point to note is that it's not suitable for people who prefer high bass audio. Also, the building quality is good considering its price. Battery-wise, I would say it provides long duration.
Connectivity is fast enough to say it fast connectivity.
And jbl app is the main hero here, without app it's not worth using.
Noise cancellation: 3 out of 5

Value for money? : ....... May be.....may be not.... Personal opinion.

Charging: 4 out of 5; The headphones fit quite well. It is apt for all kind of people. It has got great comfort in its cushions as well as it is soft and comfortable. Its appearance also feels great. Quite a great one without anything fancy. It can be folded to fit into any bags for these. Coming to the quality, it offers a great deal of high quality surround sound feel but lags behind a little bit of bass boost. It has Bluetooth v5.3 making it very much easy to connect. Software updates are available for both headphones software as well as the languages in use. The applications covers a lot of options for us to configure the device. It is a great choice if you can buy during the sales.; O fone tem uma excelente qualidade, o custo benef√≠cio vale muito. O produto √© original, seu cancelamento de ru√≠do muito bom. Uma pena que n√£o d√° pra trocar as borrachas conforme o uso pois com o tempo elas v√£o gastando. Do resto o material √© muito bom. Vale a pena; Qualidade excelente, n√£o esperava menos.
A qualidade de √°udio √© muito boa e o encaixe tamb√©m, achei muito confort√°vel e se adapta a diversos formatos de cabe√ßa, mas acho importante ressaltar que ele pode ser apertado nas orelhas e a parte de espuma n√£o √© grande o suficiente para se encaixar do jeito mais confort√°vel, o que n√£o me incomoda, mas √© algo para considerar.
Como ele se encaixa muito bem, eu posso usar em v√°rias atividades di√°rias, inclusive para me exercitar, e ele permanece fixo sem nem amea√ßar cair.
A dura√ß√£o da bateria √© extraordin√°ria e eu posso us√°-lo confortavelmente durante v√°rias horas de estudo.
Recomendo, √≥timo custo-benef√≠cio.; Vamos l√°!

em rela√ß√£o a entrega:

chegou r√°pido, por volta de 10 dias a encomenda j√° estava na minha casa, veio perfeitamente embalado e nada amassado

em rela√ß√£o a est√©tica do fone:

muito bonito, n√£o √© muito leve e nem muito pesado, peso ideal!! O seu tamanho tamb√©m √© ideal, pois n√£o √© muito grande, ele √© dobr√°vel o que ajuda caso queira guardar na bolsa, vem com tr√™s bot√µes e a loga marca da jbl! Ele √© fosco lind√≠ssimo

em rela√ß√£o a conforto:

√ìtimo! Ele √© justo e n√£o fica folgado na cabe√ßa, mas n√£o se preocupe, n√£o √© t√£o apertado a ponta de incomodar, uso ele pra fazer muscula√ß√£o, corrida, crossfit e outros exerc√≠cios que exigem muitos movimentos, ele simplesmente n√£o sai do lugar, eu tinha essa preocupa√ß√£o, mas superou minhas expectativas.

em rela√ß√£o ao som:

Espetacular! O volume √© alto, abafa muito bem os ru√≠dos, voc√™ n√£o consegue ouvir o que as pessoas dizem ao redor, um ponto interessante dele √© que vc pode se afastar o quanto for que o fone n√£o desconecta, n√£o baixa o som ou qualquer coisa do tipo

em rela√ß√£o a bateria:

√© surreal a dura√ß√£o da bateria, estou usando h√° uma semana e ela n√£o est√° nem na metade!! Obs: uso todos os dias por volta de 2hrs a 3hrs, acredito que deve durar mais ou menos duas semanas tranquilamente

Por fim, se voc√™ busca um fone com o pre√ßo bom, com durabilidade de bateria espetacular, com som bom, voc√™ precisa comprar esse fone!!! Apenas comprem, n√£o ir√£o se arrepender; Estava h√° muito tempo buscando um fone de ouvido Bluetooth com cancelamento de ru√≠do ativo at√© 500 reais, at√© me deparar com esse da JBL. Opini√£o ap√≥s um m√™s de uso: espuma muito confort√°vel, utilizo o fone o dia todo (e uso √≥culos), se encaixa bem na cabe√ßa e n√£o tive problemas nem correndo at√© o metr√¥. Possui cabo p2 remov√≠vel, mas devido a dura√ß√£o da bateria, s√≥ usei para testar (carrego o fone uma vez a cada 2/3 dias, com uso continuo). Cancelamento de ru√≠do bom (nada excepcional, mas cumpre seu papel). Apresenta ru√≠do em trepida√ß√µes (como em trens/metr√¥), possivelmente vindo do microfone, mas nada que atrapalhe muito a experi√™ncia. Padr√£o de qualidade sonora cl√°ssica da JBL, com foco nos graves acentuados. Recomendo a compra!; Good product, so far i everything is good."

For me, these truly wireless earbuds (TWS) have changed everything. No more juggling tangled cables or having trouble moving around. Whether I'm at the gym, driving, or just lounging around the house, they're ideal for listening to music on the go. What I adore most about them is this: * Crystal-clear sound: The sound is incredibly clear, with deep bass and sharp highs. * Snug and pleasant fit: A variety of ear tips sizes are included to provide a secure and comfortable fit that holds throughout movement. * Long battery life: With additional charges from the charging case, I can listen for hours on a single charge. Easy-to-use touch controls are available for playback, volume, and calling on the earphones.
These are really impressive wireless earbuds. They're an excellent choice for anyone seeking a high-end, fashionable, and practical listening experience. The following are some other items you may want to include in your review: * The particular brand and type of your earbuds * The pricing * The call quality * The noise-canceling capabilities (if applicable) * The price I hope this is useful.; Been using this for about 2 months. For ‚Çπ999, it's a really good product.
They connect fastly and has a good audio quality, bass too. Tuch gestures work really well. Both the case and the buds are lightweight so it's good to carry along. Different sizes and colored earpieces are provided, which I would say is great. Charging cable is also of good quality, though it's short.

Connectivity ranges to like 2 rooms in house and about 6-8 hours of playback, so it's not bad. Though the build quality is little poor as one of the earbud's piece came off from a fall. It wasn't broken, was able to join it back and worked well.

Good earbuds; This earbuds gives good sound quality. The design is also good. Bluetooth range is not that good. Battery life is excellent. Overall a seamless listening experience. It gives a outstanding performance and value. I got it just for 799/-. A good deal indeed.; The quality of the product is good but the only thing I don't like which is it does not fix properly in our ear and often got fallen from my ear. Otherwise the quality and sound quality is good; This airbuds is the best buds in the price range... I'm use hardly and enjoyed very much. I don't say that this is the best but ‚Çπ799 it's a good option. It's built quality is very impressive and sound quality decent... And performance avarage because this is not a gameing buds
I'm impressed; First purchase of a noise producr. I got this for 799. It's a steal. Great packaging and attention to details inside the box.
Coming to the product, well it's too good for the price but definitely not the best for all music genres. Tonal quality is preserved and it doesnt even need to be above 40 to 50% volume. Ergonomics could be a challenge for some. Doesn't absolutely snug in the ear without paining
Play around with the eq to get the most out of it
It is hands down better than any at this price range. Highly recommend; Good for listening music as well as for calling, clear audio, better battery life, easy charging, easy to carry.; Usage:
Regularly used for calls and watching videos.

Likes:
Attractive design and serves its purpose well. Offers good value for its price point.

Dislikes:
Fragile casing design; disassembled after a single drop. Lack of noise cancellation, which was unexpected and disappointing.

Conclusion:
These earbuds are functional for calls and video watching, with a pleasing design and reasonable price. However, durability issues and the absence of expected noise cancellation detract from the overall experience."

I hope you find this helpful

Cons : quite a lot
1. The battery lasts for less than 4 hours. Battery drains almost immediately when it reaches 20%
2. The right side ear piece just keeps switching off intermittently even though it's fully charged.
3. Ear pain. Not comfortable at all.
4. Music isn't too good. It's ok for normal calls however not for music. Unsure why the manufacturer claims this to be a full range speaker.
5. Good for office calls like teams however takes a while to pair. You have to keep deleting the paired device and reconnect if you use it in mono mode.
6. It takes a little setting when you first connect else the other person will hear an echo or you sound like you are speaking from the end of the tunnel.
7. During a normal voice call (paired with the phone) during travel, the other person cannot hear you. It picks a lot of background noise.
8. EQ doesn't work
9. No option to mute and touch controls aren't too effective. Takes a lot of getting used to: not easy.
10. The biggest con i think is the charging port. Trust me, landing on the moon is easier vs trying to connect the charger. You just do not know whether the charging cable is connected the right way until you switch it on and see the LED flashing. The charging port is somewhat hidden which makes it difficult to identify which way the cable has to be connected. Plus the charging cable is so short! This was the biggest turnoff honestly.
11. It's been 4 weeks and already the outer color
of the pods has faded. Unsure how will it look after a month's usage and don't really know how long will this last. Mind you; i only use this indoors and that too for office calls only.

Pros:

1. Amazing noise cancellation : you cannot hear any noise if you plug this well in your ear. However be prepared for annoying earaches even at low volume
2. Works in both mono and stereo mode
You can pair multiple devices and connect L+R seperately (Please note that you may need to delete and re-pair the device frequently)
3. Operating distance approx 15 feet after which the pods either disconnect or no audio captured.
4. The box has breathable LED LIGHTS that flash for about 5-10 seconds everytime you open/close the lid or try to charge

To summarise:
It's okay if you want to use this for your office calls however be prepared to keep charging it every 3-4 hours. Does not last as long nor sounds good as advertised. What ever you do please do not take a white piece, it gets dirty very fast. Unfortunately my return period has lapsed and I'm stuck with this!

I hope you find this review is helpful.; the looks is absolutely fabulous. the rgb lights are worth looking but cant be customized and the buds dont have rgb light. it only blinks in blue color when its connected but not playing any sound. the case goes in breathing mode while charging which looks great but major drawback is you cant know the battery level. battery backup of buds is good but the case dont seem to have good battery backup. 40ms is good for gaming. and enx technology is just a gimmick. rest built quality is good enough.
if you have higher budget go for mivi Q9 gaming buds it has customizable rgb both is buds and the case unlike immortal series; It is good product from boat and got good battery life, volume control, good fit, features and connectivity.; The earbuds are very well placed in the ear, the bass is average except this everything is great.; "

Liked the place where buttons configured on the left cup and looks premium. Grey and golden makes it classy. Audio jack included and connects well. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.
Thank you very much,

Loudness: 5/5
No distortion even at higher volumes. Negligible distortion at 100%

Clarity: 4/5
No issue is there but the crispness could have been more.

Highs: 4/5
Mids: 4.5/5
Lows: 4.5/5

Comfort: 5/5
Fits perfectly. No issue even after using continuously for 5 hours.

Touch response: 4.5/5
There are minor lags in touch response which take some getting used to. Also you can't sleep with these on. The buds register ghost touches when it touches the pillow.

Bass: 4.5/5
Punchy enough, not blunt. But could have been more pronounced

Instrument seperation: 4.2/5
A regular user won't feel any issue, but as a audiophile the instrument seperation needs improvement. A better audio codec is required for a richer sound experience. But cannot complain in this price bracket. No tws in 1k price gives satisfactory instrument seperation.

Battery: 5/5
Buds last over 5 hours at around 60% volume.

Connectivity: 4.5/5
In the same room there is no issue in connectivity. In the next room, there are some rare minor hiccups. When you go two rooms across then there are some lags

Calling and Mic: 4.7/5
In indoor condition, superb experience. But when you are in a crowded street with too much honking or near a waterfall or windy area then you can hear clearly but the person on the other side can hear noise. Nothing to complain.

All over performance: 4.5/5
There are some areas for improvement, but this is a bang for bucks. The case is small and matte finish looks good. Comfortable buds. Sound quality is good. Call quality is good. If you want an affordable TWS you can definitely go for it. Its only competetor is truke, with better call quality. But the music and vocal quality on Noise Buds N1 is best under 1k.; I've been using the Noise Buds N1 for a few hours like 5-6 hours now, and overall, they are decent wireless earbuds. The sound quality is satisfactory with clear highs and mids, though the bass could be more pronounced. They fit comfortably in the ears and are lightweight, making them easy to wear for extended periods.

The battery life is good, providing around 4-5 hours of playback on a single charge, with the case offering additional recharges. The Bluetooth connectivity is stable, and pairing is straightforward. However, the touch controls can be a bit finicky and take some getting used to.

For the price, the Noise BUDS N1 offers good value, especially for casual listeners who want an affordable, reliable pair of earbuds. They're not perfect, but they get the job done for everyday use.; I recently purchased the Earbuds N1 and overall, I am quite satisfied with my experience. Here are my thoughts:

**Sound Quality:** The sound quality is decent, providing clear and balanced audio. Whether it's for music, calls, or podcasts, the earbuds perform well across various audio formats.

**Fit:** The fit of the earbuds is also good. They are comfortable to wear for extended periods without causing any discomfort, making them ideal for daily use.

**Connectivity:** One of the standout features is the fast connectivity. Pairing the earbuds with devices is quick and seamless, ensuring a hassle-free experience.

**Build Quality:** The only downside I found is the build quality of the case. It could be improved to match the overall quality of the earbuds themselves. The case feels a bit flimsy and could use a more robust construction.

**Conclusion:** Despite the minor issue with the case, the Earbuds N1 are a great choice with good sound quality, comfortable fit, fast connectivity, and a useful gaming mode. I would recommend them to anyone looking for reliable and affordable earbuds.; Advantages - very compact design, nice colour , build quality of specially buds is good , volume level is very high , sound quality is decent
Disadvantage - build quality of case is poor , the lead of the case is very unstable and feels cheap

My personal experience- I recied this product with broken seal , the lead of the case is very problematic; What I like about Noise Buds N1 is everything that I needed in earbuds it has provided like matfinish and strong build quality, i like the colour of this product so much, coming to the most important part the performance of the product so far I love the sound quality of the product and one can hear the bass of the audio very well; Audio is clear, mic quality is super,size are small, fast charging and easily to connect the mobile; Good quality, ease of use and high music audio with enough battery life; I have been using noise VS104 max for quite some time. And now this noise N1.
Noise always provides value for money product. The sound and bass quality is up to mark for this price. Although the microphone needs a bit improvement."

Its performance is worth the price Highly recommended!""; I recently got my hands on the Ptron Bassbuds duo, and I must say, they have been quite a pleasant surprise.
As a budget-conscious consumer, I was initially skeptical about their performance, but after putting them to the test, I'm impressed with what they offer for the price.

Sound Quality: The standout feature of the Ptron Bassbuds duo is their audio quality. The bass response is punchy and powerful, as the name suggests. For bass enthusiasts, these earbuds won't disappoint. However, the bass isn't overpowering and still maintains a good balance with the mids and highs. The overall sound signature leans towards warmth, which makes them ideal for genres like pop, hip-hop, and electronic music.

Design and Comfort: The design of the Ptron Bassbuds duo is sleek and compact, with a glossy finish that gives them a premium appearance.

Connectivity: Pairing the Bassbuds duo with my smartphone was effortless, and they maintained a stable connection with minimal dropouts during use.

Call Quality: While the sound quality for music playback is excellent, the call quality on the Ptron Bassbuds duo is average. Callers on the other end reported my voice to be slightly muffled, and the built-in microphone didn't provide the best noise isolation in noisy environments.

Final Thoughts: The Ptron Bassbuds duo offer exceptional value for money, providing an impressive audio experience at a budget-friendly price point. They excel in bass reproduction, making them a great choice for bass lovers. The design, comfort, and battery life are commendable, and the inclusion of touch controls is a definite plus.

UI:
Power On. Hold the center button for 2 seconds and the earphones with say in a Japanese/Indian woman's voice, ""power On, battery about 70%"". She does not sound Chinese like the cheap Chinese headphones. Her voice volume level is not very high either.

BT pairing:
Turn off the headset, press and hold to center button but keep holding the same button. The headsets voice will say, Bluetooth pairing"". Once connected, it will say, ""Bluetooth connected"". If BT disconnects, the voice says, ""Bluetooth disconnected"".

Next track:
Press and hold the + button for 2 seconds and the headset will make a cute ""chime"" and load the next song in the playlist of any app. I like this feature of the chime because this way I know the headset has accepted the command and loading the next track. However, holding the button for 2 second everytime you want to change songs can get annoying and painful if you want to skip a couple of songs of just skipping endlessly waiting for the right song to play. Buttons aren't very soft but do have a tactile click to ensure you feel the click when pressed.

Power off: just like power on, hold the center button for 2 seconds and the headset will turn off.

Volume up/down: No audible feedback, just volume increase or decrease.

Status LED:
Blue: when On and slow blinking when connected to bt. When in pairing mode, the same light blinks quickly in the same blue colour.

Orange: while charging. Solid on.
Green/off: 90% and above.

Physical clues: tiny nub on the left ear plug to denote left side. Only reputed brands have it.
Same tiny bump is made in the volume up button on the controller to denote volume +.
Coloured Dots on the plastic controller to denotr left and right channel.
Ear plugs are colour coded and fit very well in my ears. Most of the ear plugs fall out of my ears while talking. These don't. I use the smallest one.

What does Sony offer?
A very neat guide on how to insert the ear plugs in your ears the most comfortable way and ensure the best seal for clear audio. I've never known that you can pull you ear up from the top corner and gently place the ear plug into your ear canal. Once placed comfortably, drop the ear and let the ear canal seal in.

Audio App. It's basically a music player designed to detect the sony earphones. If you use spotify you can use this app to setup an equaliser. It plays MP3 from your storage too. My phone already has a built in Equalizer. I don't use any eq because the sound stage on these is flat. So all types of audio sounds great.

FAQ
Is it flimsy?
No, but feels like you might damage it if you're not careful.

Does it really last 25hr?
Yes, I've tested it sort of. And never managed to run out of battery.

How much did you spend on it?
1.6k

Audio lag?
None. I tested it with Android TV, LG web os, Android phone, ps4 and iPad. No issues of lag or disconnection or audio drop on super quiet moments of the song.

Bass?
Very decent and controlled.
Vocals?
Very clear
Treble?
Sharp and crisp.
Loudness?
You can listen at full volume without much discomfort. But I'd suggest not to.

I compared it with JBL wave tws100. The sound is very similar but a we bit less bass on flat eq.
80% Better than boat airdopes.
30% better than OnePlus bulletsZ.; I will just sum it up, Sony delivers in quality on all fronts, good battery,good bass,clear sound, comfortable, good connectivity,good mic and the sound overall is Rich. Only thing i am concerned about is the quality of material used on wires,very soft and lean, somehow i feel like the material isn't durable even though after almost 4 months, it's still new and strong.; I purchased this item, trusting the brand value of Sony. But so far this is the poorest quality sound I have ever experienced in any earphone. Utterly disappointed. To be honest it sounds like a cheap road side earphone. No bass at all. No high sound even if you keep max volume. Total loss for the amount. I have used Boat and JBL earlier and they are much better compared to this cheap product. Also no magnet for earpieces. Weak quality.; I am an old customer of sony, but I was confused about this product due to the reviews. But it is what actually I want, according to sound it lacks volume but soundstage is good, trebles work perfectly, vocals are clear, bass is soothing and deep. I like the integration of application which tells me my listening hours and set an equalizer according to my preference. I don't know much about DSEE upscaling but it makes a difference, listening to these earphones feels like listening to wired earphones with no lag and weird sound upscaling which other TWS does. Build quality will be a concern for rough users but not for me, it is pretty good for me. The neck part is not stiff which makes it easy to carry. I am a designer, According to a designer's perspective I would it has attention to details like the left and right are separated even with a color difference. Although, I didn't like the long press to change controls system and its not customizable. These earphones are waterproof and have sufficient battery life to support through my busy weeks. Also we can change the language of the instructor of earphones, I chose Japanese because I am a big fan of anime. Also the buds are non magnetic, but it dosen't creates much problem. At last buy these only when you aren't a rough user and wants high volume.; I once carried it in my backpack along with my smartwatch. I don't know if this caused any signal interference but it just doesn't work properly after that. For now, it works if you bring your phone 1 cm close to the antenna (the small rectangular box on the left) but if you place your phone on the table or keep it in your pocket, it stops working. So it's just pointless to use it anymore.

I don't know if this is something common with Bluetooth headphones, neckbands, and all. But I don't think this should have happened. Something is wrong with these products. I'd better stay with wired headphones to avoid the frustration of wireless gadgets.

The sound quality, the app support, the battery and the design are so good. You can buy it if you want a cheap and quality neckband. But just don't keep it near other Bluetooth devices.; Tive dois WI-C200 que duraram 4 anos, √≥timos, e acredito que s√≥ duraram 4 anos porque era usado no sol e no suor.

O fone queimou com apenas 15 dias de uso. Estava usando para estudar e do nada parou e n√£o ligou mais. J√° coloquei pra carregar e nem ali acende mais.; Really pleased with these buds. Exactly what I wanted. Sound is great. They fit well in the ear, and the cable is well balanced, so they don‚Äôt fall out unless they get snagged on something. And the battery seems to last forever. Good Sony quality.; TL;DR: These minimalist headphones from Sony do everything I need them to do, and I can wear them for hours on end with no discomfort.

These headphones are great! For whatever reason, my ears are the wrong shape for many in-ear headphones (""earbuds""), unless they are incredibly small: after about 10 minutes of use, my ears are hurting so bad I can't wear them anymore. I've found that the solution for me is ""neckband"" headphones, where the electronics are stored in the neck band, and the earbuds can be extremely minimal.

These headphones are incredibly light-weight, fit comfortably in my ears, and have enough battery life to get me through any task I've used them for. The microphone is good for phone calls, though it picks up a good deal of background noise (FYI, in case you're trying to talk while you do something semi-noisy in the background). The build quality is all what you would expect from Sony, who have been making consumer electronics as long as I've been alive.

They have no ANC (active noise cancelling), but at the $20 price point I paid for them, that would really have been expecting too much.

The sound quality is GREAT _for what I'm doing_. I mainly listen to podcasts or make phone calls with them. I have only listened to a little bit of music with them, and do not consider myself an audiophile (let's blame minor hearing loss), so I can't comment on the quality of the bass, muddiness, or any of the other audiophile stuff.

My only complaint is that because the ""neckband"" is really just a cord, these can sometimes shift around as you are moving. I'm not sure I could recommend them for doing any kind of bouncing physical activity (plyometrics, cardio, sit ups, etc.) unless you have some way to hold them in place.

Overall I would definitely buy these again, but since they're from Sony I don't expect I'll have to any time soon."

CONS
1. the mic is average and the voice feels a little modulated on the mic provided .
2. the case is little bulky due to longer battery life but you will get used to it in about 2 to 3 days. The case quality is decent but the case lid feels like its built out of crappy plastic and doesnt feel robust or stable in hand.
3. these airdopes are based on bluetooth v 5.0 and later and they will work great with all the devices having the same bluetooth version i.e v5.0 or newer however in case of older versions there is a lot of latency lag. I personally use these with my laptop that has v5.0 and they work great however when i connect them with my android phone which has bluetooth v 4.10 , the experience is horrendous ... there are many problems like latency lag, voice breaks etc even when the bt v.50 is backwards compatible .... i experience this latency lag and voice break during calling , whatsapp calling and playing simple mobile games. Despite all this there is no problem while streaming songs on these airdopes.
4. there is a lot of voice leakage if you use them on 100 percent volume both on laptop and mobile phones you will have to tweak them ... the voice is also kind of high so you will not be able to listen to anything on 100 percent anyhow .... 50 to 60 is an ideal level for all the movies and games as well as music.
5. Your ears will hurt after prolonged usage of these if you dont select the right size of air caps ... 3 sizes are already provided inside the box.
6. The biggest con while using these airdopes on windows is that you cannot use the airdopes and the inbuilt mic together .... windows doesnt allow it even if you try very hard to use both the mic and airdopes output speaker together Its a windows issue but is manageable .
7.Another big problem is that the voice control option is absent on the airdopes and the volume cant be controlled from the airdopes ... you will have to control it from the device which is also a big problem .

PROS-
1. the sound quality and the bass are great .
2. the battery life is great you can easily use them for 7 to 8 hours on continuous usage.
3. They charge very quickly, in a jiffy.
4. They feel even greater if you enable surround sound while using them on windows platform.
5. the connectivity is great too ;as soon as you open the case they will automatically detect and connect to the available devices that you paired them with earlier within seconds.
6. There is literally zero latency and zero lag on these while connected on the same bluetooth version .... i used these on my laptop and played all the games like cs go, valorant, gta 5, and other games but there is no issue while gaming or music.
7.There is a support for mono audio and you can use one airdope at a time instead of using both.
8.Boat has provided a year's warranty on these so they can be easily replaced in case of a damage if the damage occurs within the given time frame .

Overall the product can be optimized a bit more but is still good to use now and is a decent purchase on this price point ; however better options are available if you intend to use it just for calling purpose , better go with something wired or something that comes with older bt versions if you intend to use them with devices with older bluetooth versions ."

This product is one in which I have a lot to say!

Used for 6 days.

To start, I would first start with the that this is a fantastic value product. At Rs 700 it is pretty much a steal.

Coming to sound quality.
It is simply overloaded with bass. Just like those bass guitars. This feels like I'm listening to one good wired headset. If you're a bass lover, this is just for you!
But on the other side of the coin. It's just bass, minute background instrumental sounds are simply lost by the bass! The vocals are also slightly affected by the overpowering bass. Definitely not seen on bluetooth earphones. If you don't have any Equalizer like Dolby or something, wouldn't recommend this for you. Because trebles are weak, mid tones & high tones too!
On the positive note tweaking on the equalizer by reducing the intensity of Low/bass. It works fantastic. The clarity is fantastic after some tweaking. You get great vocals, good mid level tones and balancing lows/ bass. Very good dynamic range (at this price).

Battery:
It's simply fantastic, nothing else to say. Using it since 3-4 days, still at 80%. Will check and update how it works when at 30% level. After 30% you get low battery msg after every 30 seconds. But don't bother as all new earphones have this feature.

Ergonomics:
This is one place, that is seriously BAD. The earbuds do not stay in the ear, not matter which size you pick! It will always pop out. Very annoying, can't listen to music or videos without pushing the earphones inside. Even the earphones are slippery.
The power & volume controls are on the inside side (Why?!) . Very difficult to adjust or pause music using earphone controls. Seriously how can anybody be so Bad?! People should really work on product design and prioritize comfort to the end user. But can't complain at this price point!

Call Quality:
Update: Works great, clear audio to both the speaker and the listener. Initially it was bad but after 5-6 days of usage it works perfectly!

The double pairing feature works as advertised, can be connected to laptop and mobile simultaneously like bigger bluetooth headphones.

Colour & design is good, but functionality matters more.

If this review helps, kindly hit the helpful button so that others can see this too!

Ps: Will update this review after 2-3 months.

~Quality Controller

Great delivery and service by Appario, Amazon.; Wow product. I have been using it for a month or soo n I have used it for 10 days in a go without charging with upto 7 8 hrs use per day. It actually meet its 160 hrs playback time commitment. Highly recommended although it's quality is little bit low due to all plastic part and looks not soo classic. But if U want to go for playback time. It gives U unimaginable results.; Bass is average and sound Quality is Cristal clear , battery backup is amazing as company says it be.; After using this product for 5-6 months I am facing the following problems:
1. Sound quality is not good.
2. Volume adjustment is not adequate. After keeping a low volume output of the volume always feels high.
3. Battery backup is not good. After reaching 60% of charge it always powered off within a very short time (5-10 minutes).
I am very strange that the earphone belongs to such a reputed brand of Zebronic.; The product functions well. Its feature of dual pairing is seamless and beneficial. But due to its large size it creates a problem. The Classic Earphone problem of lossing audio in one or both earpieces over time. And it is caused by the tension tear of wires at the base of neckband main body.

Suggestion to Designers:
Please reduce the length of the rigid portion the goes by the back of neck or increase the lenght of wire to earpieces.
This will prevent the wires from frequent turns that over time cause the wires inside to break because of excess tension.; For 7 months it was working fine.
Sound was decent and charging was also fine
But one day it stopped working it still shows charging but don't connect or play any sound."

4) THE BATTERY BACKUP IS VERY GOOD

CONS:-
1) THE WORST DRAWBACK IS THERE IS DISTORTION IN THE EAR BUDS WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON AND THERE IS NOTHING PLAYING IN THEM
2) THE CHARGING CASE LIGHT ONLY SHOWS THE BATTERY % OF THE CASE
3) THE LIGHT ON THE CASE JUST STAYS GREEN AND DOES NOT INDICATE THE BATTER
4) WHILE CHARGING THE CASE THE LIGHT ONLY FLASHES RED AND ONSE ITS FULL CHARGED THE BLINKING STOPS; ; Great bass, material quality is good, touch controls and connectivity not that much great, compared to realme realme a awesome product; waste of money, does not fit properly in ears ,keep falling out, ENC is just for name shake. No use in calling. Sound quality also not that impressive.
Other side person keeps complaining about the sound.
U&I is far better than this and cheaper."

Buy these tws, if you are looking for bass heavy truly wireless earphones, i have previously used many Tws and for me these are the best sounding earphones, this is the best thing which i have heard and the bass is very powerful and now for me these earphones are the one with which i'll compare my future purchases.

Detailed Review

Packaging is good

The quality of the charging case is good and the quality of earphones is excellent as well.

Type c charging port is a plus point.

Earphones in the case charges very quickly.

Sound is excellent with clear highs, mids and lows i.e perfect for all genre of songs like edm, r&b etc.

The mic provides very nice calling experience.

Bass is the best which i have ever heard, i.e very powerful and thumpy and you will surely love it.

Battery backup is excellent.

Pairing is quick and easy.

Single earphone can be used while the other one is charging (like using only left or right while the other is charging)

Touch sensor on earphones are present (no physical clicking button)
1 tap : Play/Pause
2 taps on right : increase volume
2 taps on left : decrease volume
3 taps on right : change to next song
3 taps on left : change back to previous song
Long press : power off/on

Excellent for working out in gym or while running/jogging
I have tested these in the park while running and they don't fall off.

Very light weight and compact case and earphones and due to this no problem in keeping the case in pocket and no problem in using these earphones for long durations.

Fit of the earphones is very good and it will not fall out from the ears.

Mic quality is also very nice.

Range is also very nice.

In conclusion, according to me these are the best truly wireless earphones in this range and you will love these.; ANC is at its worst and battery backup also not good. But only music is clear in this buds with good bass. And the charging case is enough to charge buds only 2 times; The product is nice and sounds very good but for me it was not very comfortable in the ear also Amazon shipping and delivery was slow. It is definitely value for money.
It comes with a one year warranty.
It also comes with additional ear pieces if the one given is not fit for you which is very helpful. Also it contains touch controls.

The case of the earbuds is very beautiful with a Matt finish.

Must buy product.; I wanted this type of airport.
Bass level is high.
Battery backup 6-7 hours and box backup is 30-35 hours.
Very nice and adjustable in earüëÇ.
I suggest you all to buy it.
Thanks Amazon.; Pros :
1) good bass n sound at low volume till 7
2) at this price it is best I think
3) for gaming also good as low latency
Cons:
1) bass is good but at higher the volume it gets dizzy n just booming not that clear (at this price good)
2) As buds looks small but for not fit as paining in 1 ear just after few minutes of use (bad experience)
3) connectivity is only 3-4 meters not 10 meters (not expected)
4) sometimes gets disconnected n sound gets public (can be adjusted not that often)
Overall as my POV good sound n somewhat good look are only features it posses other wise it doesn't have any other pros, so if you can increase your budget then go for the realme buds or any other (not boat as they are overpriced used airdopes 161 their best value for money); I watched a number of reviews about Hopup airdoze earbuds on YouTube before buying it from Amazon. As the reviews stated the bass quality is awesome. Mic and call quality is average. Also considering the price perspective there is nothing to complain. In terms of mic and call quality ""Truke Clarity 6"" is the winner around 1000 rupees price range earbuds. Battery of Hopup airdoze is a concern as the backup is not so good , in terms of battery ""Blaupunkt BTW 100 Extreme 100"" is the best.; I bought Hoppup Earbuds S40 on May 5, 2024. After 20 days, the Bluetooth connection and touch controls stopped working. If you can, spend more money on better earbuds. Don't buy these budget ones.; 1years waranty by 28November 2024,plz halp line nomber"

I was looking for a budget-friendly earphone with good sound quality and durability. I have to say that I am very impressed with this product. The earphone has a sleek design and a comfortable fit. The sound quality is excellent, with clear highs and deep bass. The noise cancellation feature works well and blocks out most of the ambient sounds. The earphone also has a built-in microphone and a multifunction button that allows you to control your music and calls. The cable is tangle-free and sturdy, and the earphone comes with a carrying pouch and extra ear tips. Overall, I think this is a great earphone for the price and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and affordable wired earphone.; Fits well in my ear, the build is good, esp. the wire is tangle free... Sound quality is good and works well. Haven't checked Noise cancellation feature yet; Good for music but not good for conversation. The mic quality is very bad. If the mic is held close to mouth also the voice is not audible to other person. Instead of noise cancellation voice cancellation is happening :-); Fit 10/10
Sound 10/10 ( Bass is not overpowered it is actually having a thump and good surrounding thanks to micro woofers inside, that's a clever implementation by boult I must say that because the micro woofers actually makes this earphone stand out in terms of bass that is of high quality)
Value for money -10/10 (this type of bass is seriously a treat to experience in 350‚Çπ segment I had the xiaomi dual driver and realme buds 2 too and I am telling you both have bass but the quality of bass in boult is rich followed by realme buds 2 which I feel has a overpowering bass but doesn't have surround effect like boult loop 2)
Mic : 10/10 ( quality is good and the provision of collar clip is a big plus to fix the mic position close to mouth. There are many earphones that have mic closer to the ear but with earphones that has mic in between often creates a distance that makes the talking a bit challenging as one has to hold it near mouth to be heard clearly but with the provision of collar clip this hassle is solved. So thanks boult for providing that collar clip its so helpful)

Conclusion: if you are music listener or a calling person, this covers both perfectly. And give the ""loop"" style, the fit is also perfect - not too tight nor too loose, just perfect. This type of quality in 350‚Çπ is seriously appreciable üëèüëèüëè.; I had ordered them in August and my initial experience was fabulous, but these earphones have a inbuilt flaw in them I think, because the material and construction looks durable from outside but and even after having no sort of physical damage and good handling one side started malfunctioning all of a sudden.

( This review might seem long but it is worth it. Boult asks it's employees to call the customers after a month for their reviews and asks us to write reviews, obviously they are positive because initially no one faces any issue and after a few months they cannot find their reviews to edit them. I found mine luckily so I am going to cover everything in detail.)

This review has date stamps of my experience and previous reviews to give you detailed idea of my experience.

17 SEP : my initial review
24 March : the issue arises
5 April : Final verdict

17 SEP :
Honestly I have been using these earphones since over a month now and I joyfully admit these have a very good sound quality. The earbuds fit in properly, cutting most of the noise. . I have tried mi, realme buds and boat and this one is clearly my choice.
Pros:
1. Proper fit
2. Clear sound at all levels
3. Good bass while still maintaining proper treble, mids and highs.

Cons:
1.loud even at least volumes
2. I experience static some times when the connector is at certain angle.
(Maybe it's just with my earphones ..this issue is not much of concern for me right now but if I face any problems in future I have already registered for warranty just to be cautious and I also got a call from their call center about quality of product and my experience, so I kind off hope they will be co-operative incase any issue occurs. I am very happy with these earphones .)

24 March:
The right side earpiece has started bugging me..it has loose connection all of a sudden now and I have to manually rotate the wire time after time to fix it. I am going to issue warranty if the problem increases which I am sure is going to happen very soon.

5 April :
As expected the right side has stopped working, so I called the customer care numerous times since past week, sadly, no reply came. I am disappointed in this brand seriously, they want good reviews and sales but they don't even answer customer care and warranty registration therefore is useless.

I don't think I am ever gonna buy wired earphones again, they all work good in the beginning and then they start malfunctioning after a few months, I have tried almost 5 brands now (MI, Realme, Boat, Boult, Motorola) and same experience has came to me every single time.; Overall the quality of the product is good üòä; I bought the Boult Audio Bassbuds Loop Wired in Ear Earphones with Mic with 12mm Powerful Driver for Extra Bass with Customizable Ear Loop and I am very happy with my purchase. The earphones have a sleek design and a comfortable fit. The sound quality is excellent, with rich bass and clear vocals. The mic is also decent and picks up my voice well. The wire is tangle-free and durable. The ear loop is customizable and helps to keep the earphones in place. The price is very reasonable for the quality and performance of these earphones. I would recommend these earphones to anyone who loves music and wants a good pair of wired earphones.; Got delivered on Jan 2, 2024 so 4 months into using and the right side is already without any sound. Initially the sound got lowered and now it's completely off. Quite disappointed with the quality & standard with respect to price. Used different brands all are actually same."

I am a light user of earphones/headphones since I don't particularly enjoy closing my ears to external sound. OnePlus Nord Buds 2 TWS in Ear Earbuds are ideal for me as they have great battery back up and I only need to charge it every couple of weeks or so. The earphones have a premium sound to it especially when paired with OnePlus devices. With other devices, you will have to compromise on the option to customise the audio to your personal liking as the official app doesn't support this particular pair of earphones. Not much of a worry since you can tweak the device settings to make the earphones sound to your liking. The Mic is subpar, but no complaints when you take into account the price point!
My suggestion is that, if you're currently in the market for a brilliant sounding TWS with great battery at a substantially low price point, please don't look further. Go ahead and place an order for these earbuds!; After 3 years of extremely rough use knockoff Chinese wireless Bluetooth earbud kicked the bucket. Earbud, because one of them still work(and people say Chinese tech is poorly made). At the time of buying those knockoff earbuds it was around the same price as these One Plus Nord Buds 2 price range, actually I believe it was slightly cheaper(I cannot for the life of me remember). I am not a heavy earbuds user, I mostly use it to listen to podcasts in the morning and pair it with my laptop to listen to music while I work at night. The buds seldom leave the vicinity of my work desk at home, no exposure to the elements of nature and no exposure to sweat. I clean my earbuds regularly. That being said I do listen to a wide range of music, I'm no audiophile, but can identify change in quality in the listening device.

With that in mind, these earbuds offer an okay sound quality, hence why I gave it 4 stars, the sound quality is clear and don't have much noise, the trebles are well balanced so as to not rupture your eardrums, but the bass is overblown which is why I gave it 3 stars. The bass drowns out the other sounds, and overwhelms your ear. Especially if you are listening to an orchestral piece, you'll struggle appreciate the individual artists. This can be solved with software to a certain extent. By using the ""HeyMelody"" app you can configure your OnePlus Nord Buds 2. You can use pre configured sound profiles like Balanced, Bold, Serenade, or Bass. There is also the BassWave option which allows you to adjust the clarity and fidelity of the bass via software. If you are still unsatisfied you can configure your own custom profile by adding an equalizer and creating the ideal audio setup.

Now one of the more attractive feature of these buds I have seen from other buyers is the ANC at this price point. Honestly I don't really use the feature that much, mostly because I like to be aware of my surroundings and not get completely immersed in whatever I'm doing on the computer/phone. But the ANC works kinda well? I mean it's not the same as Apple's ANC, but for 3k you should temper your expectations. By holding down on the touch gesture surface on the ear buds or by going into the app on your phone you can enable ANC. It was able to completely tune out the ambient buzzing sound of my Air Conditioning, which is old and loud, so I think the ANC is very good. The only thing is when there is no audio playing you'll hear a hissing or buzzing sound if you have ANC enabled. It's not super annoying, but that is just my personal opinion.

As for battery backup, I have managed to go 2 days without charging the buds, but this is with light usage. It still has 90% left even after I have used it for 2 days so I think the battery backup is good. The case is sturdy and the buds fall into place within the case magnetically. Bluetooth connectivity is seamless and that's all I have to say about the buds.

I have however talked to people that bought these buds as a part of expanding their OnePlus ecosystem, and they claim that these buds are amazing when paired with their OnePlus phone or OnePlus tablet. I wouldn't know, I don't believe in ecosystems.

But people, for 3k this is totally worth the price. Haven't met with any issues till now, if I do I'll make sure to update this review. Cheers; The Oneplus Buds 2R are a fantastic pair of wireless earbuds that offer great sound quality and a comfortable fit. The design is sleek and modern, with a compact charging case that is easy to carry around. The earbuds themselves are lightweight and stay securely in place, making them perfect for workouts or daily use.

In terms of sound quality, the Buds 2R deliver crisp highs, rich mids, and deep bass, providing an immersive listening experience across various music genres. The active noise cancellation feature works effectively in blocking out external noise, allowing you to focus on your music or calls without distractions.

The touch controls on the earbuds are intuitive and responsive, making it easy to adjust volume, skip tracks, or answer calls with a simple tap. The battery life is impressive, offering up to 30 hours of playtime with the charging case, ensuring that you can enjoy your music throughout the day without worrying about running out of battery.

Overall, the Oneplus Buds 2R are a great choice for anyone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds with excellent sound performance, comfortable fit, and convenient features. I highly recommend them for music lovers and those who value both style and functionality in their audio accessories.

I am very satisfied with these buds Love these‚Ä¶; The best purchase so far. Oneplus has truly stood out with it's quality. Quality and durability is top notch. My buds fell from 5th floor into the lift pit and are still working absolutely perfect. Sound quality and noise cancellation is amazing. Charging is efficient for active listeners like me. Also is very comfortable for ears. It is worth a buy. Highly recommended!!!; Used for a year and the product is amazing with smooth comfort. The performance is great and it requires less time charging for greater hearing time. No pain in ears unlike typical ear buds. It fits right to the ear and very rarely falls from the ears. Sound quality is awesome. Worth the buy; I am writing this review after 4 months of purchase, the Bluetooth headphones are very good from one plus and what i liked about the headphone is that it had a very nice noise cancellation and connects to your smartphone very well and within seconds, the bass was pretty average though might be good in higher priced headphones,; For sound if u r music love it is not for u the reason is.... suppose u are listening a rock song or any song the vocal u hear are not coming good ,
this thing less the pleasure of a song and u not like it . It is not for a music lover .i don't recommend it for music lovers.

But if u are a normal user listening music , u not notice anything wrong .you like it and they are bassy and good for u .i recommend it for them .

Appearance good , build quality is good ,they are comfortable and fit good in ear .; If you have expectations for your 60$ do not buy these. You cannot walk 20 ft away from your phone without losing connection. I would return them if I could. I have a OnePlus 10. I love the phone but the buds suck.; I have been using it for regular phone calls and team meetings and both cases it was great. Audibility is good and noise cancellation works great even when there was my kid playing in the background. Very rarely people complain about lost comms due to aggressive noise cancellation.

If you are considering these earphones because you are in for a decent pair of earphones that are loud enough, good ANC and budget friendly these are for you.; Honestly I don‚Äôt listen to music much so I cannot say anything about sound quality. I do know that within 2 days the left one broke. Right one still works great but I‚Äôd love to have 2.; They work well, although a little uncomfortable. But that will likely be different from person to person. They are just a little uncomfortable after wearing for a while, for MY ears.; Such good value ear buds. Very good depth of sound."

Very easy to use.; Wonderful earphones , i really loved it , this earphone is value for money , design, quality and battery backup is very good.s bass is super, calling experience is also good. overall awesome performance.; This is just an awesome piece of headphones, with a really great sound quality. I haven't heard this good quality in any of the headphones in this price range. Powerful bass which stands out and doesn't muffle up other frequencies.. thanks to the quality 13mm drivers. Only one disadvantage is that the wire from the mic is too thin. But for careful usage it should not be a problem. If in doubt to buy it.. just burn the doubt and go for it. Great product pTron.; I recently purchased the Ptron Neckband, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed with this wireless neckband. It's incredibly lightweight and comfortable to wear for extended periods, thanks to the flexible neckband design that ensures a secure fit around my neck. The sound quality of these neckbands is nothing short of exceptional. The Ptron Neckband delivers rich, clear, and well-balanced audio. One of the standout features of the Ptron Neckband is its impressive battery life. I can easily go through several days of moderate use on a single charge. The Bluetooth connectivity is stable and quick, and I've had no issues with dropouts or disconnections. The built-in microphone provides crystal-clear call quality. These neckbands are designed with comfort in mind. Overall I am fully satisfied with this Neckband.; This headphones looks good, fit comfortably, portable and it's sound is clear. The best thing is that they last up to 45 hours on a single charge and recharge quickly. You can connect them to two devices at once, and they stay connected well. The mic makes your calls clear by reducing background noise. The performance of the Bluetooth is just awesome. Value for Money.; Sound Quality:
The audio performance is simply outstanding. The bass is deep.

Battery Life:
The battery life is impressive. I can easily get through the entire day on a single charge, even with heavy usage. Plus, the quick charge feature is a lifesaver when I need a fast boost.

Comfort and Design:
The ergonomic design of the neckband ensures a comfortable fit for long hours of use.

Connectivity:
The connection is stable, with no noticeable lag or drops in connection.

Durability:
The build quality is robust and durable.; Packaging very bad. No seal nothing. Box already opened all sides.
Build quality is good. Earpiece size is slightly big, not for small - medium ear.

Loudness: 5/5
No distortion even at higher volumes. Negligible distortion at 100%

Clarity: 4/5
No issue is there but the crispness could have been more.

Highs: 4/5
Mids: 4.5/5
Lows: 4.5/5

Comfort: 5/5
Fits perfectly. No issue even after using continuously for 5 hours.

Touch response: 4.5/5
There are minor lags in touch response which take some getting used to. Also you can't sleep with these on. The buds register ghost touches when it touches the pillow.

Bass: 4.5/5
Punchy enough, not blunt. But could have been more pronounced

Instrument seperation: 4.2/5
A regular user won't feel any issue, but as a audiophile the instrument seperation needs improvement. A better audio codec is required for a richer sound experience. But cannot complain in this price bracket. No tws in 1k price gives satisfactory instrument seperation.

Battery: 5/5
Buds last over 5 hours at around 60% volume.

Connectivity: 4.5/5
In the same room there is no issue in connectivity. In the next room, there are some rare minor hiccups. When you go two rooms across then there are some lags

Calling and Mic: 4.7/5
In indoor condition, superb experience. But when you are in a crowded street with too much honking or near a waterfall or windy area then you can hear clearly but the person on the other side can hear noise. Nothing to complain.

All over performance: 4.5/5
There are some areas for improvement, but this is a bang for bucks. The case is small and matte finish looks good. Comfortable buds. Sound quality is good. Call quality is good. If you want an affordable TWS you can definitely go for it. Its only competetor is truke, with better call quality. But the music and vocal quality on Noise Buds N1 is best under 1k.; I've been using the Noise Buds N1 for a few hours like 5-6 hours now, and overall, they are decent wireless earbuds. The sound quality is satisfactory with clear highs and mids, though the bass could be more pronounced. They fit comfortably in the ears and are lightweight, making them easy to wear for extended periods.

The battery life is good, providing around 4-5 hours of playback on a single charge, with the case offering additional recharges. The Bluetooth connectivity is stable, and pairing is straightforward. However, the touch controls can be a bit finicky and take some getting used to.

For the price, the Noise BUDS N1 offers good value, especially for casual listeners who want an affordable, reliable pair of earbuds. They're not perfect, but they get the job done for everyday use.; I recently purchased the Earbuds N1 and overall, I am quite satisfied with my experience. Here are my thoughts:

**Sound Quality:** The sound quality is decent, providing clear and balanced audio. Whether it's for music, calls, or podcasts, the earbuds perform well across various audio formats.

**Fit:** The fit of the earbuds is also good. They are comfortable to wear for extended periods without causing any discomfort, making them ideal for daily use.

**Connectivity:** One of the standout features is the fast connectivity. Pairing the earbuds with devices is quick and seamless, ensuring a hassle-free experience.

**Build Quality:** The only downside I found is the build quality of the case. It could be improved to match the overall quality of the earbuds themselves. The case feels a bit flimsy and could use a more robust construction.

**Conclusion:** Despite the minor issue with the case, the Earbuds N1 are a great choice with good sound quality, comfortable fit, fast connectivity, and a useful gaming mode. I would recommend them to anyone looking for reliable and affordable earbuds.; Advantages - very compact design, nice colour , build quality of specially buds is good , volume level is very high , sound quality is decent
Disadvantage - build quality of case is poor , the lead of the case is very unstable and feels cheap

My personal experience- I recied this product with broken seal , the lead of the case is very problematic; What I like about Noise Buds N1 is everything that I needed in earbuds it has provided like matfinish and strong build quality, i like the colour of this product so much, coming to the most important part the performance of the product so far I love the sound quality of the product and one can hear the bass of the audio very well; Audio is clear, mic quality is super,size are small, fast charging and easily to connect the mobile; Good quality, ease of use and high music audio with enough battery life; I have been using noise VS104 max for quite some time. And now this noise N1.
Noise always provides value for money product. The sound and bass quality is up to mark for this price. Although the microphone needs a bit improvement."

Now I have to wait for 4 days to get a refund ?; Works with my Galaxy S21FE.
Build quality is not great, but not flimsy either. The USB C port looks sturdy and fits well. 6/10
Sound quality is average but good enough for watching content, not for audiophiles.6/10
Good bass 7/10
Good midrange 6/10
Treble average, just like most earphones... Can compare to boat quality. 5/10
Stereo separation or surround is not that good. Overall sound is not bad at all for the price.
And it doesn't make that clunky crackling sound that cheap earphones make when you press into the ear!
They've given a free leatherette pouch which is nice!
One issue....In the middle of playback sometimes gets disconnected randomly.
To sum it up- there are very few low cost USB-C earphones and this is one of the better ones at such low price! Buy it if you get it in INR 200-300!
N.B. the mic doesn't seem to be working.... Won't be of use if you're buying to make calls!; The sound quality is not balanced. Treble is more. Cheap product.; Superb! Go for it!!!; This is my replacement. and this too doesn‚Äôt work . What is the use of warranty and pouch when the product doesn‚Äôt do the job it is created for . Shame .

1. Really long battery life - one charge would last me a week of regular use.
2. Sturdy build - I move around pretty roughly and the never saw the wires tearing anywhere even after 2 years
3. Decent sound - I am not an audiophile. Don't know much about trebble, bass, highs, lows. The sound was good.

Cons:
1. Once the battery percentage is below 20, you can't listen to music as it keeps shouting ""Oops! Battery low"" every five seconds. This was the most irritating part and kept me wondering why it is even there.
2. It picks a lot of noise while calling if you are in a slightly busy space like office, or road. So not meant for calling
3. The rubber grip that helps to hold it in place came out easily as it would rub against my bag. Since then, I couldn't use it properly as the earphones would fall off.; This is product is very impressive with many fuctions like sound quality and it's durability of battery power. Service is also nice to reach to the customer. At this range they value for your money. Also light weighted product to feel comfortable.; Overall bass and treble balance is good, and music is good. Battery life is excellent, Icharge it once every two weeks. What I don't like is that the right side is heavier than the left side for the additional control switch present, which add to weight. Except this, its a very good product.; Just received the product. Yet to use for some time before I can give a detailed review. At the outset, product seems good. But I was very put off by the poor quality of the USB-C Cable. It does not work. Tried calling Amazon to report this, but only got automated messages with a promise to call back in one minute which did not happen! I hope to receive a replacement USB-C Cable of better quality which works well. This is a small accessory but the poor quality is tarnishing the name of a good brand like BoAT. Very sad!; I am posting this review after i am using ut for 1 month, see everything is good sound, battery, noise cancellation.
But the most worst thing is those 2 hook like structure which makes your earbud fix to you ear sp it won't fall but after 30 min u will feel pain in the where it stucks, and after like 1 hrs it gets worse. So main. Problem is those little outbreak on earpiece.
Rest is good in this price I don't see any change in sound after changing the mode. But everything is balanced.
If you are talking about calling experience it is good not best but good.; 1. The Product Was Good,Without Any Damage.
2. The Earphones Battery Was Insane, Nearly 2Weeks Without Charge.
3. The Earphones Has Good Durability,Water Resistance.
4. The Price Was Really Ok,Good.
5. The BeastXp Mode Was Really Nice,Noise Cancellation Was Good,Low Latency Was Ok.; Durability - The only negative point and the biggest issue is the durability. I bought this neckband in Nov 2023 and in 6 months, one of the ears has stopped working. This is the standard issue of all Boat earphones.
Sound quality - Great sound quality. I can easily differentiate between the different layers of music. Audio is also clear. Never had an issue with hearing. Even the microphone is good.
Battery life - Great battery life! I have charged the band only a few times. Even after using 4-5 hours every day, I didn't need to recharge the battery for the whole week.; Nothing spectacular but will get you through the day. Sound quality is average no noise cancellation but that can go by without noticing . Durability is surely a plus one. Light weight . No complains so far."

I contacted Noise customer service for assistance, but they were unhelpful and did not provide a satisfactory resolution. Despite multiple attempts to resolve the issue, including calling customer support ,emailing them. I have not received a working replacement or a refund.

Overall, I am very disappointed with both the product quality and the customer service. I would not recommend Noise ear pods based on my experience.; Every time am purchasing noise products what am expecting from product that is absolutely i getting and build quality , product quality also very nice thanks.; ALL Three stars goes for battery backup !

I recently got Sony WF-LS900N and had to return it for its poor battery backup. It is almost 10 times costlier than this but battery gets over 10 times faster as well :)

Such a costly device could not get 1-2 hrs of talk time (6 hrs of total wearing time). Everything was great except the battery. So with heavy heart returned.

Then saw this 'Noise cancelling buds from NOISE' launch. As the price was way cheaper(1/10th) thought of giving a try. Got it on same day.

Positives. Battery is really good. It drops only by 30% at end of the day (after talking around 60-120 minutes )
Sound - Decent. Sorry as i can not compare to 12K sony buds. But i am happy.
Call quality - It is okay apart from noise cancellation.

Negatives:-
NO NOISE CANCELLATION WHATS SO EVER !!
The buds are not comfortable to wear for long time. Ear get pain at times. Manageable .
Pairing. At times, you need to manually pair. Don't know why.
Buttons. They are really confusing. There is nothing to disable & enable noise cancellation (as per manual or per their website). if you press little longer, it goes to reset.
No app to configure too. If there was an app where we can turn on /off noise cancellation, that would have been great too.

Over all , for the price i paid - I am not returning it . Will just keep it ! I may still look for a better buds if i come across (pricing was never a concern for me. But battery was. But when i got the battery right, many other things gets compromised). Hope I get something soon with a proper battery with a good noise cancellation device.; Excellent product; sound quality is good; Don‚Äôt take its .. no sound clearance .. worst performance"

For me, these truly wireless earbuds (TWS) have changed everything. No more juggling tangled cables or having trouble moving around. Whether I'm at the gym, driving, or just lounging around the house, they're ideal for listening to music on the go. What I adore most about them is this: * Crystal-clear sound: The sound is incredibly clear, with deep bass and sharp highs. * Snug and pleasant fit: A variety of ear tips sizes are included to provide a secure and comfortable fit that holds throughout movement. * Long battery life: With additional charges from the charging case, I can listen for hours on a single charge. Easy-to-use touch controls are available for playback, volume, and calling on the earphones.
These are really impressive wireless earbuds. They're an excellent choice for anyone seeking a high-end, fashionable, and practical listening experience. The following are some other items you may want to include in your review: * The particular brand and type of your earbuds * The pricing * The call quality * The noise-canceling capabilities (if applicable) * The price I hope this is useful.; Been using this for about 2 months. For ‚Çπ999, it's a really good product.
They connect fastly and has a good audio quality, bass too. Tuch gestures work really well. Both the case and the buds are lightweight so it's good to carry along. Different sizes and colored earpieces are provided, which I would say is great. Charging cable is also of good quality, though it's short.

Connectivity ranges to like 2 rooms in house and about 6-8 hours of playback, so it's not bad. Though the build quality is little poor as one of the earbud's piece came off from a fall. It wasn't broken, was able to join it back and worked well.

Good earbuds; This earbuds gives good sound quality. The design is also good. Bluetooth range is not that good. Battery life is excellent. Overall a seamless listening experience. It gives a outstanding performance and value. I got it just for 799/-. A good deal indeed.; The quality of the product is good but the only thing I don't like which is it does not fix properly in our ear and often got fallen from my ear. Otherwise the quality and sound quality is good; This airbuds is the best buds in the price range... I'm use hardly and enjoyed very much. I don't say that this is the best but ‚Çπ799 it's a good option. It's built quality is very impressive and sound quality decent... And performance avarage because this is not a gameing buds
I'm impressed; First purchase of a noise producr. I got this for 799. It's a steal. Great packaging and attention to details inside the box.
Coming to the product, well it's too good for the price but definitely not the best for all music genres. Tonal quality is preserved and it doesnt even need to be above 40 to 50% volume. Ergonomics could be a challenge for some. Doesn't absolutely snug in the ear without paining
Play around with the eq to get the most out of it
It is hands down better than any at this price range. Highly recommend; Good for listening music as well as for calling, clear audio, better battery life, easy charging, easy to carry.; Usage:
Regularly used for calls and watching videos.

Likes:
Attractive design and serves its purpose well. Offers good value for its price point.

Dislikes:
Fragile casing design; disassembled after a single drop. Lack of noise cancellation, which was unexpected and disappointing.

Conclusion:
These earbuds are functional for calls and video watching, with a pleasing design and reasonable price. However, durability issues and the absence of expected noise cancellation detract from the overall experience."

Loudness: 5/5
No distortion even at higher volumes. Negligible distortion at 100%

Clarity: 4/5
No issue is there but the crispness could have been more.

Highs: 4/5
Mids: 4.5/5
Lows: 4.5/5

Comfort: 5/5
Fits perfectly. No issue even after using continuously for 5 hours.

Touch response: 4.5/5
There are minor lags in touch response which take some getting used to. Also you can't sleep with these on. The buds register ghost touches when it touches the pillow.

Bass: 4.5/5
Punchy enough, not blunt. But could have been more pronounced

Instrument seperation: 4.2/5
A regular user won't feel any issue, but as a audiophile the instrument seperation needs improvement. A better audio codec is required for a richer sound experience. But cannot complain in this price bracket. No tws in 1k price gives satisfactory instrument seperation.

Battery: 5/5
Buds last over 5 hours at around 60% volume.

Connectivity: 4.5/5
In the same room there is no issue in connectivity. In the next room, there are some rare minor hiccups. When you go two rooms across then there are some lags

Calling and Mic: 4.7/5
In indoor condition, superb experience. But when you are in a crowded street with too much honking or near a waterfall or windy area then you can hear clearly but the person on the other side can hear noise. Nothing to complain.

All over performance: 4.5/5
There are some areas for improvement, but this is a bang for bucks. The case is small and matte finish looks good. Comfortable buds. Sound quality is good. Call quality is good. If you want an affordable TWS you can definitely go for it. Its only competetor is truke, with better call quality. But the music and vocal quality on Noise Buds N1 is best under 1k.; I've been using the Noise Buds N1 for a few hours like 5-6 hours now, and overall, they are decent wireless earbuds. The sound quality is satisfactory with clear highs and mids, though the bass could be more pronounced. They fit comfortably in the ears and are lightweight, making them easy to wear for extended periods.

The battery life is good, providing around 4-5 hours of playback on a single charge, with the case offering additional recharges. The Bluetooth connectivity is stable, and pairing is straightforward. However, the touch controls can be a bit finicky and take some getting used to.

For the price, the Noise BUDS N1 offers good value, especially for casual listeners who want an affordable, reliable pair of earbuds. They're not perfect, but they get the job done for everyday use.; I recently purchased the Earbuds N1 and overall, I am quite satisfied with my experience. Here are my thoughts:

**Sound Quality:** The sound quality is decent, providing clear and balanced audio. Whether it's for music, calls, or podcasts, the earbuds perform well across various audio formats.

**Fit:** The fit of the earbuds is also good. They are comfortable to wear for extended periods without causing any discomfort, making them ideal for daily use.

**Connectivity:** One of the standout features is the fast connectivity. Pairing the earbuds with devices is quick and seamless, ensuring a hassle-free experience.

**Build Quality:** The only downside I found is the build quality of the case. It could be improved to match the overall quality of the earbuds themselves. The case feels a bit flimsy and could use a more robust construction.

**Conclusion:** Despite the minor issue with the case, the Earbuds N1 are a great choice with good sound quality, comfortable fit, fast connectivity, and a useful gaming mode. I would recommend them to anyone looking for reliable and affordable earbuds.; Advantages - very compact design, nice colour , build quality of specially buds is good , volume level is very high , sound quality is decent
Disadvantage - build quality of case is poor , the lead of the case is very unstable and feels cheap

My personal experience- I recied this product with broken seal , the lead of the case is very problematic; What I like about Noise Buds N1 is everything that I needed in earbuds it has provided like matfinish and strong build quality, i like the colour of this product so much, coming to the most important part the performance of the product so far I love the sound quality of the product and one can hear the bass of the audio very well; Audio is clear, mic quality is super,size are small, fast charging and easily to connect the mobile; Good quality, ease of use and high music audio with enough battery life; I have been using noise VS104 max for quite some time. And now this noise N1.
Noise always provides value for money product. The sound and bass quality is up to mark for this price. Although the microphone needs a bit improvement."

Build quality is not great, but not flimsy either. The USB C port looks sturdy and fits well. 6/10
Sound quality is average but good enough for watching content, not for audiophiles.6/10
Good bass 7/10
Good midrange 6/10
Treble average, just like most earphones... Can compare to boat quality. 5/10
Stereo separation or surround is not that good. Overall sound is not bad at all for the price.
And it doesn't make that clunky crackling sound that cheap earphones make when you press into the ear!
They've given a free leatherette pouch which is nice!
One issue....In the middle of playback sometimes gets disconnected randomly.
To sum it up- there are very few low cost USB-C earphones and this is one of the better ones at such low price! Buy it if you get it in INR 200-300!
N.B. the mic doesn't seem to be working.... Won't be of use if you're buying to make calls!; The sound quality is not balanced. Treble is more. Cheap product.; Superb! Go for it!!!; This is my replacement. and this too doesn‚Äôt work . What is the use of warranty and pouch when the product doesn‚Äôt do the job it is created for . Shame .

1. Really long battery life - one charge would last me a week of regular use.
2. Sturdy build - I move around pretty roughly and the never saw the wires tearing anywhere even after 2 years
3. Decent sound - I am not an audiophile. Don't know much about trebble, bass, highs, lows. The sound was good.

Cons:
1. Once the battery percentage is below 20, you can't listen to music as it keeps shouting ""Oops! Battery low"" every five seconds. This was the most irritating part and kept me wondering why it is even there.
2. It picks a lot of noise while calling if you are in a slightly busy space like office, or road. So not meant for calling
3. The rubber grip that helps to hold it in place came out easily as it would rub against my bag. Since then, I couldn't use it properly as the earphones would fall off.; This is product is very impressive with many fuctions like sound quality and it's durability of battery power. Service is also nice to reach to the customer. At this range they value for your money. Also light weighted product to feel comfortable.; Overall bass and treble balance is good, and music is good. Battery life is excellent, Icharge it once every two weeks. What I don't like is that the right side is heavier than the left side for the additional control switch present, which add to weight. Except this, its a very good product.; Just received the product. Yet to use for some time before I can give a detailed review. At the outset, product seems good. But I was very put off by the poor quality of the USB-C Cable. It does not work. Tried calling Amazon to report this, but only got automated messages with a promise to call back in one minute which did not happen! I hope to receive a replacement USB-C Cable of better quality which works well. This is a small accessory but the poor quality is tarnishing the name of a good brand like BoAT. Very sad!; I am posting this review after i am using ut for 1 month, see everything is good sound, battery, noise cancellation.
But the most worst thing is those 2 hook like structure which makes your earbud fix to you ear sp it won't fall but after 30 min u will feel pain in the where it stucks, and after like 1 hrs it gets worse. So main. Problem is those little outbreak on earpiece.
Rest is good in this price I don't see any change in sound after changing the mode. But everything is balanced.
If you are talking about calling experience it is good not best but good.; 1. The Product Was Good,Without Any Damage.
2. The Earphones Battery Was Insane, Nearly 2Weeks Without Charge.
3. The Earphones Has Good Durability,Water Resistance.
4. The Price Was Really Ok,Good.
5. The BeastXp Mode Was Really Nice,Noise Cancellation Was Good,Low Latency Was Ok.; Durability - The only negative point and the biggest issue is the durability. I bought this neckband in Nov 2023 and in 6 months, one of the ears has stopped working. This is the standard issue of all Boat earphones.
Sound quality - Great sound quality. I can easily differentiate between the different layers of music. Audio is also clear. Never had an issue with hearing. Even the microphone is good.
Battery life - Great battery life! I have charged the band only a few times. Even after using 4-5 hours every day, I didn't need to recharge the battery for the whole week.; Nothing spectacular but will get you through the day. Sound quality is average no noise cancellation but that can go by without noticing . Durability is surely a plus one. Light weight . No complains so far."

Its budget friendly.; Best thing about this product is its battery backup that can last upto 1 week without charging the case on day to day usage. Overall sound quality and bass is good. Works just fine with Windows, and Android devices. But has frequent connectivity issues with ios. A recommended budget friendly and easily handleable product for a longer period of time.; I recently purchased ear pods from Noise, but unfortunately, they stopped working shortly after use. Specifically, one of the pair is not getting charged neither it produces any sound

I contacted Noise customer service for assistance, but they were unhelpful and did not provide a satisfactory resolution. Despite multiple attempts to resolve the issue, including calling customer support ,emailing them. I have not received a working replacement or a refund.

Overall, I am very disappointed with both the product quality and the customer service. I would not recommend Noise ear pods based on my experience.; Every time am purchasing noise products what am expecting from product that is absolutely i getting and build quality , product quality also very nice thanks.; ALL Three stars goes for battery backup !

I recently got Sony WF-LS900N and had to return it for its poor battery backup. It is almost 10 times costlier than this but battery gets over 10 times faster as well :)

Such a costly device could not get 1-2 hrs of talk time (6 hrs of total wearing time). Everything was great except the battery. So with heavy heart returned.

Then saw this 'Noise cancelling buds from NOISE' launch. As the price was way cheaper(1/10th) thought of giving a try. Got it on same day.

Positives. Battery is really good. It drops only by 30% at end of the day (after talking around 60-120 minutes )
Sound - Decent. Sorry as i can not compare to 12K sony buds. But i am happy.
Call quality - It is okay apart from noise cancellation.

Negatives:-
NO NOISE CANCELLATION WHATS SO EVER !!
The buds are not comfortable to wear for long time. Ear get pain at times. Manageable .
Pairing. At times, you need to manually pair. Don't know why.
Buttons. They are really confusing. There is nothing to disable & enable noise cancellation (as per manual or per their website). if you press little longer, it goes to reset.
No app to configure too. If there was an app where we can turn on /off noise cancellation, that would have been great too.

Over all , for the price i paid - I am not returning it . Will just keep it ! I may still look for a better buds if i come across (pricing was never a concern for me. But battery was. But when i got the battery right, many other things gets compromised). Hope I get something soon with a proper battery with a good noise cancellation device.; Excellent product; sound quality is good; Don‚Äôt take its .. no sound clearance .. worst performance"

For me, these truly wireless earbuds (TWS) have changed everything. No more juggling tangled cables or having trouble moving around. Whether I'm at the gym, driving, or just lounging around the house, they're ideal for listening to music on the go. What I adore most about them is this: * Crystal-clear sound: The sound is incredibly clear, with deep bass and sharp highs. * Snug and pleasant fit: A variety of ear tips sizes are included to provide a secure and comfortable fit that holds throughout movement. * Long battery life: With additional charges from the charging case, I can listen for hours on a single charge. Easy-to-use touch controls are available for playback, volume, and calling on the earphones.
These are really impressive wireless earbuds. They're an excellent choice for anyone seeking a high-end, fashionable, and practical listening experience. The following are some other items you may want to include in your review: * The particular brand and type of your earbuds * The pricing * The call quality * The noise-canceling capabilities (if applicable) * The price I hope this is useful.; Been using this for about 2 months. For ‚Çπ999, it's a really good product.
They connect fastly and has a good audio quality, bass too. Tuch gestures work really well. Both the case and the buds are lightweight so it's good to carry along. Different sizes and colored earpieces are provided, which I would say is great. Charging cable is also of good quality, though it's short.

Connectivity ranges to like 2 rooms in house and about 6-8 hours of playback, so it's not bad. Though the build quality is little poor as one of the earbud's piece came off from a fall. It wasn't broken, was able to join it back and worked well.

Good earbuds; This earbuds gives good sound quality. The design is also good. Bluetooth range is not that good. Battery life is excellent. Overall a seamless listening experience. It gives a outstanding performance and value. I got it just for 799/-. A good deal indeed.; The quality of the product is good but the only thing I don't like which is it does not fix properly in our ear and often got fallen from my ear. Otherwise the quality and sound quality is good; This airbuds is the best buds in the price range... I'm use hardly and enjoyed very much. I don't say that this is the best but ‚Çπ799 it's a good option. It's built quality is very impressive and sound quality decent... And performance avarage because this is not a gameing buds
I'm impressed; First purchase of a noise producr. I got this for 799. It's a steal. Great packaging and attention to details inside the box.
Coming to the product, well it's too good for the price but definitely not the best for all music genres. Tonal quality is preserved and it doesnt even need to be above 40 to 50% volume. Ergonomics could be a challenge for some. Doesn't absolutely snug in the ear without paining
Play around with the eq to get the most out of it
It is hands down better than any at this price range. Highly recommend; Good for listening music as well as for calling, clear audio, better battery life, easy charging, easy to carry.; Usage:
Regularly used for calls and watching videos.

Likes:
Attractive design and serves its purpose well. Offers good value for its price point.

Dislikes:
Fragile casing design; disassembled after a single drop. Lack of noise cancellation, which was unexpected and disappointing.

Conclusion:
These earbuds are functional for calls and video watching, with a pleasing design and reasonable price. However, durability issues and the absence of expected noise cancellation detract from the overall experience."
