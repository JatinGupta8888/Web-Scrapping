Firstly, a big thanks to Amazon for hassle free exchange and delivery on time! And seller Appario retail once again has impressed me with their quality service.
Coming to the tablet, it's hands down the best there is at the budget range.
Screen- 8/10 As good as a TFT panel can be, bright enough and vibrant enough. It's no AMOLED but it's great. I didn't listen to the bad reviews, thankfully. There's no light bleed on my unit, as so many have said. Maybe they've fixed the issue. I had a Galaxy Tab 10.1 with a very good display. The contrast level is much better here. Viewing angles could have been little better though.
Processor- 8/10 I think nobody's buying this tablet to seriously pursue heavy gaming. For the regular user, the updated SD720G is a very snappy processor. No lags or jitters. I've worked with drawing apps and Rough Animator without any issues at all. RAM plus takes care of multitasking and app management.
Battery- good enough to last a day of use. Depends what kind of user you are, for average user it'll last more than a day. Expect SOT of 7-8 hrs at least! Just video streaming can last for 10-11 hrs at medium brightness!
S-PEN- 10/10 The reason why most people will be buying this tablet, and it will not disappoint. It takes the whole experience to a different level. Works like a charm, Samsung has fine tuned it over so many years. Worth it!
Software- 10/10 Samsung IS the most evolved Android UI there is at the moment. And they have optimised it for tablet. So many features like multi windows, gestures, air command and their integrated ecosystem and features like Samsung Dex work seamlessly for work user experience. Plus Samsung is exceptional nowadays with updates.
So my experience with this tablet is awesome and it's the best there is at this range. Period. Some other manufacturers like Lenovo,Realme etc may seemingly give you more bang for the same cost. But nothing can match the overall experience.
Overall 8.5/10
Value for money- 10/10 as the s-pen is included!; I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite during a great summer offer, and at the price of 14k, it's hard to find fault with. It's an ideal choice for professionals needing it for office use, students looking to take notes, and beginner artists.

In terms of performance, I found it to be quite efficient for everyday tasks. However, at its regular pricing, I would complain that it shows some lag when multitasking. The sound quality is good, but it could be louder for a more immersive entertainment experience. Overall, considering its current price, the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a worthwhile investment for those seeking a versatile and affordable tablet; If you are a student or a working professional and need to take notes or create slides, this is what you need. Value for money and under 25k budget this is the best buy.
Fast charging. Screen size is quite good to watch youtube videos, with a quite decent RAM it provides smoothness. And my favourite part is the pen.; Love this tablet, it isn't super powerful like my phone but it's still more fun to use the tablet, and the S pen it's fantastic; S pen working very well.overall satisfied with it performance. camera quality is not too good, overall I can say in this price range good tablet; The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a great tablet for students who are looking for a device that can handle both study and productivity tasks. It comes with an S Pen stylus that is included in the box, which makes it easy to take notes, draw, and annotate documents. The stylus also attaches magnetically to the side of the tablet, so you don't have to worry about losing it.

The tablet has a 10.4-inch TFT display that is bright and sharp, with good viewing angles and colors. The screen size is ideal for watching videos, reading e-books, and browsing the web. The tablet also has dual speakers that are tuned by AKG, which deliver clear and loud sound quality.

The tablet is powered by an snapdragon processor, which is capable of handling most apps and games smoothly. The tablet also has 4GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of internal storage, which can be expanded with a microSD card. The battery life is impressive, as the tablet can last for up to 12 hours of video playback on a single charge.

The tablet has a sleek and premium design, with a metal back and thin bezels. It is available in three colors: Angora Blue, Oxford Gray, and Chiffon Pink. The tablet is also lightweight and slim, making it easy to carry around.

The tablet runs on Android 13 with One UI on top, which offers a lot of customization options and features. The tablet also supports Samsung DeX mode, which allows you to connect the tablet to a monitor or TV and use it as a desktop PC. The tablet also has some useful apps pre-installed, such as Samsung Notes, Samsung Kids, and Netflix.

The only drawbacks of the tablet are that it does not have an AMOLED display, which would have offered better contrast and colors; it does not have a fingerprint scanner or face unlock, which would have made it more secure; and it does not have a keyboard cover accessory, which would have made it more productive. The s Pen is the magic wand 🪄 but it's tip got damaged only after 4 days of use....

Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a fantastic tablet for students who want a versatile device that can handle both study and productivity tasks. It offers a good display, a powerful performance, a long battery life, a premium design, and an S Pen stylus that is included in the box. It is also priced reasonably compared to other tablets in the market. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is definitely a must-buy for students who are looking for a tablet that can do it all.

Bad:
I ordered Pre booking. I got product late than those who ordered on first day. Also on day 1 there were free Amazon earbuds were provided to those who purchased. But nothing was provided to Pre-bookers. No point in pre-booking. Just avoid it.; Blazing performance, decent battery life and the complimentary keyboard is cherry on the top. Multi-tasking is so convenient on this tablet. Screen quality and sound quality are quite surprising. It's a total delight to watch movies on this, dialogues are crisp clear. Already planning to buy one more for my family members. Total value for money.; Good one suitable for this tab. Value for money.; The Honor Pad 9 is a perfect example of how not to make a tablet. Its performance is sluggish, making even basic tasks feel like a chore. The display is mediocre at best, with dull colors and poor brightness, making it nearly impossible to use outdoors. The build quality feels cheap and flimsy, like it would break if you looked at it too hard. The software is riddled with bloatware and outdated features that make you wonder if they even tried. If you’re looking for a tablet to frustrate you daily, the Honor Pad 9 is your best bet.; This's one of the best tab in category. The performance is super smooth, thanks to Gen 1 processor. The display is also good, far better than my Samsung s6 lite tab. Speakers are loud specially when you play on VLC player with 100% + volume. Camera quality is decent, unlock screen quickly. Despite large size, the weight of the tablet is light. 35 watt charging is decent, doesn't take too long to charge. Touch is very responsive. And the free keypad quality is superb, side hinges are made of metal, hold magnet is strong and keyboard feels premium quality. Overall I'm very satisfied with the tablet at this price point of view.; Very good specs and features.
Long battery. Screen with clarity.
Very user friendly.
Worth to buy.
Not a gaming person so can't comment in this aspect.
Free keyboard is big bonus in this budget.

Expecting a pencil also to make it complete set.; Overall performance is good with Battery, speakers, display, decent camera but don't expect any mobile camera quality.
The keyboard they provided is also of very nice quality and is overall good
Most importantly the sound, the 8speaker system with hires audio works really good
NOTE: Only flaw i encountered is it does not support other universal stylus for note taking., stylus option is available in note app but may be it supports only honor stylus(which is not available currently)if u want to use it for note taking... Wait for their stylus or u can use capacitive touch which is decent enough but not as good as a stylus pen"

• Battery : Battery life is very good. It gives 12-15 hr SOT for normal usages like reading books, doing Online classes through Zoom, Watching videos on YouTube, etc

• Performance : I was worrying about 2GB RAM, But I am surprised. Performance is very good for normal usages and keep 3-4 normal apps in memory easily. Even if only 600MB free for user.

• Screen : Screen Quality is also good.

• Built Quality : Very Good, Feels like premium tablet.

• Updates : I got one System update (One UI 2.1) with sequrity patch and one Sequrity Patch (July 2020)

• USB Type C

• Not a Chinese OEM

¥ Cons
• Sound : Sound quality is below the average. Dolby is just for marketing. Sound is loud but quality is bad.

• Charging Speed : 7.5 Watt Charge takes about 4hr to charge from 30% to 100%

• Camera : Camera Quality is also very bad but for tablet it is not a deal breaker.

# Overall it is very good product considering price. You should buy this Tablet if your Budget is around ₹15k and and Sound quality of speaker is not your priority. I am satisfied with this.; Seeing the specifications it seemed Samsung has launched this Tab with the sole purpose of playing videos which actually was the sole need for which I was looking for a Tab. And the Tab does its job good enough that me and my friends were impressed by its performance.

Not a super amoled screen, but if not kept side by side with one, it will be difficult to spot the difference for a rookie like me. Display is much much better than any other Tab in this price point. 10 inch is perfect for me. Samsung does have the best displays in its devices.

2GB ram is the only drawback I see in it, however as I said its sufficient for watching videos. Good enough for Amazon Prime, Netflix, HotStar and few other streaming apps. Not sure why Samsung doesn't give atleast a 3-4GB in a Tab in this price point whereas they are giving 6-8GB rams in there mobile of same price range. I understand the screen size and budget but atleast 3GB would have been great and I beleive it is a fair ask too.

It is light, but holding for too long does cramp your hands. Doesn't has a Gorilla glass.

Sound quality is OK. You feel the one sided speakers. There are two outputs at the bottom. It would have been better if they were located each either side instead. I have a JBL Go so no issues in the sound department.

6000mAh battery is slightly less for a tab, 1-2K more would have been ideal.

Quite a few if' are there about this Tablet, but it simply does beat all other Tabs at this price point with better features. If you are looking for a budget Tab for watching movies an series, then you can definitely go for this Tab. It will not disappoint you for sure.

Have some doubts about the phisical button quality, installed alternative apps first day itself.

Samsung is the best choice for electronics any day.

Amazon's service was undoubtedly superb. Also got a pretty decent discount.; I was worried about the performance because of 2 gb ram, but to my utter surprise the device works fine, it knows its capacity and accordingly it manages the whole system so as to provides smooth and uninterrupted experience. Im loving it, no lags as of now, can't say about future. I'm using everything except gaming. Payment apps can't be used without sim card so does not work on the wifi version, like paytm, Google pay etc. There are apps which might not be optimized for using in tablets and so they are not available for downloads like my jio, swiggy etc Overall evaluate the cost and benefit of having a tablet, regarding apps these are the inherent limitations of a wifi tablet, nothing to do about Samsung. Rest is quite satisfactory and definitely its value for money.

Update
After one month of use, still not faced any issues, except little lag when too many apps are open and try to switch between apps. Back camera serves the purpose of capturing images of documents for scanning and front camera could have been better, during video calls my video is always blur, tried using different apps like Duo, hike, whatapp etc on 4g internet, 5 mp cam of iPhone gives so clear images and video quality, little disappointing so far front cam is concerned.

For reading pdf files I am using acrobat and xodo, you can highlight, underline, strikethrough, use free hand pen, add comments while reading. There are other features as well. For note taking its not much friendly as palm rejection is not supported, but it works fine otherwise. I am using ELV stylus for reading and casual marking on pdfs.

The device looks premium and whoever sees it, does not belive that its price is 15000, people thinks its worth will be around 25K or 30K. Thank you samsung for the device and thank you amazon for everything."

1. Fast Charging, Charges 0 to 100 faster than any other pad currently in the market including 10th Gen iPads
2. Responsive performance, on par with iPads, some geekbench 6 scores are better than Snapdragon 8 gen 1.
3. If you are not playing games and just doing normal tablet stuff, this holds charge for almost 3 days
4. Superb build quality, feels really good on your hands, also looks very modern and stylish
5. Screen Black levels almost like AMOLED
6. Great sound quality
7. Screen ratio is good for note taking and viewing eBooks and pdfs
8. Wifi 6 supports upto 1 GBPS through wifi 6 supported routers, very low download times if you have a fast connection.
9. Supports USB peripherals by OTG
10. Good Quality Front camera
11. No Heating issues at all, also no throttling
12. Very Good Screen Brightness
13. Comes with a 100 Watt Charger
Cons:
1. Although screen is HDR capable, it’s not certified by Netflix
2. Most apps work on 60Hz to 120Hz and not 144Hz (general Android issue)
3. Advertised Oneplus 5G sharing not implemented yet (tried with OP 10 Pro)
4. Integration with Platform eco system is not as good as iPad or Samsung
5. I feel accessories are bit expensive considering their capabilities
6. No Fingerprint sensor & Face sensor is hit & miss sometimes
7. Software could be more optimized for Tablet use
Conclusion:
Best Android pad currently in the market if you consider the cost.
People who are thinking ipad 9th gen, should remember that’s the 64GB model of iPad you get for around 40K, 256 GB is 27K more than OP 256GB. Being said that, iPad only makes sense if rest of your devices are from apple.
If your primary usage is Media consumption, I would suggest Xiomi Pad 5 as its cheaper and comes with suitable aspect ratio.
Buying OP pad makes sense if you want to future proof it for at least next 3 – 4 years.; OP Pad is a great option in the price range.
Got it for 33k with the card discount for the 12gb ram 256gb rom variant.
Once you start using this display aspect ratio you simply won't be able to go back to 16:9 or 16:10 ratio which the other tabs offer.

It just makes so much sense once you start using it. Yes you will be chunkier black lines but it's minor compromise.

Dimensity 9000 makes short work of any task. And is significantly better than SD870 which is offered in the Xiaomi pad 6.
It's just as wide as the mi pad 6, so you are not losing out on the width, it's just a bit taller than mi pad6 or the usual 11in tabs out there.; Just got the tab delivered yesterday.

Let me list the pros for 12gb/256:
1. Great big display
2. Sounds seems amazing as well for a tablet (I was using iPad mini 2 previously)
3. Powerful and so gaming experience will be great
4. Battery life is good enough.

Cons:
1. Missing fingerprint reader
2. No 3.5mm jack
3. OS needs to be improved for it to feel more like a tablet
4. No SIM slot

Overall a great tablet for anyone looking for an Android tablet. If you are okay with iOS you can of course go for iPads.; This is truly value for money. Before purchasing, I was in completely confused, which one to buy b’een competition… but at last One plus pad gets the award … truly remarkable…
Battery : very low consuming while on zoom and watching movie’s. OS: very intuitive and fast response. No lagging. Refresh rate is very good. Sound qila is awesome with excellent speakers .
In short , you’ll value for your money. GO FOR IT 🔜👍; Amazing tablet; Display - nice display plus smooth touch.
Good sound somewhat.
Super Slim. Looks really nice and cool to me.; You can't Install Some off APPs in this TAB, EX: Amazon, Rapido etc....
Worst part is: this tab delivered to me on 24th May contacted service, 25th May handover for DOA to service no reply from them, finally contacted thrice to call centre still they are working on resolution.
Today is 12th June
Never settle - Issue's; It's brilliant display with high quality hardware makes it the best in its segment ."

Great product; Day 2 of using -

I honestly liked this very much, it's just outstanding and I am in love with it.

Pros :- Display, Sound, Battery, UI, smooth functioning.

Cons :- When you have more than 5 apps running in background, it may lag or hang. You might not be able to play high performance games or use multiple apps back to back.

Overall, I'd say it's a 10/10, hope it continues to be a fantastic product.; The Xiaomi Pad 6 stands out as a high-performance tablet offering exceptional value for money. Its sleek design and solid build quality give it a premium feel, while the 11-inch 2.5K display is stunning, with vibrant colors and a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. This makes it perfect for watching movies, playing games, or reading.

Performance is a key highlight, thanks to the Snapdragon 870 processor. The tablet runs smoothly, whether you’re multitasking, gaming, or using intensive apps. The 8840mAh battery ensures you can use the device for extended periods without worrying about running out of power, and the fast charging support means you can quickly top it up.

The camera setup, while not groundbreaking, is sufficient for video calls and casual photography. The quad speakers offer a surprisingly good audio experience, adding to the multimedia appeal of the device.

With optional accessories like a keyboard and stylus, the Xiaomi Pad 6 can also serve as a productivity tool, making it suitable for students and professionals alike. The MIUI for Pad interface is intuitive and adds to the overall smooth user experience.

In summary, the Xiaomi Pad 6 delivers exceptional performance, a brilliant display, and great battery life, all at a competitive price point, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking for a versatile and affordable tablet.; ; Had an old ipad. This is a genration change as far as speed.& capabilities are concerned. Excellent screen, very fast charging and very handy.Worth the price."

I was about to return it when I decided to give it another try! Luckily,
I was able to set it up easily! This tablet is wonderful! Clear picture, very thin and light weight. I am very happy with this tablet and I recommend it. 5 ✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️; Cette tablette ne fonctionne pas au Canada. J’ai parlé à un technicien de Samsung qui m’a dit de contacter Amazon. Incapable de parler à quelqu’un chez Amazon!; Very Happy With It; If you're looking to play casually. Sure. But if you're looking to play professionally or top-tier. Nope. It runs the game just fine, but the screen jitters when you move your camera. It makes precise aiming incredibly impossible sometimes the swiping is fast and sometimes it's slow, it has to do with how the screen registers where your finger is.

And if you play with a six-finger cloth or so many fingers on the screen that this doesn't even know how to sense your fingers.

If you're only looking for performance then this is good, but if you're looking to improve and accurately shoot at people, I can't recommend this.

My previous device was the Apple iPad Pro 2020 11-in and I played professionally on that.

The screen jitteriness on this one makes it almost impossible to be consistently accurate when shooting at people.; Purchased for my wife and she loves everything about it. Nice clear display, great sound quality, and quite a snappy performer. We have had several android tablets but always go back to Samsung. Connects easily to the internet and mobile hotspot from her phone so she can watch her tv shows anywhere. She is very happy and so am I, very happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone."

I hope you get the idea from it go for higher it will be more better than this and; This review is not for product but the delivery and return process of amazon. Ordered this tablet and found out that this one is not charging at all, so called the amazon customer support and they said 'no worries, get a diagnostic report from samsung service centre and with that certificate, return the product'. So i went to samsung care and the guys over there helped getting me the diagnostic report certificate named ""dead on arrival"" (DOA).

Now, i called the amazon customer support and they arranged pickup for return of tablet (with DOA certificate) and delivery of new tablet. And here comes the paradox... (Remember why i was returning the tablet? It wasn't charging, and so it was literally dead on battery)
The delivery guy says he needs to see the IMEI number on the device in the 'about device' menu on the battery dead tablet, i said it is impossible since the tablet won't start. He said 'then I can not complete the process' and left.

I again made a call to amazon customer service and the guy on the line said 'sir, you are our prime member, we'll have it sorted in 24 hrs' and again arranged the pickup + delivery.

Again the loop started, the delivery guy wanted the IMEI number on dead tablet and without that he wouldn't process the delivery of new tablet.
I was stuck in this paradox of showing IMEI number of the dead device by going to about section of device which needs it to get powered up first (that the tab obviously can't)

But this delivery guy was considerate enough, he said, let's try putting it on charge and even if I get pic of that 'about device' menu that shows the IMEI number, I'll process the return right away. My luck struck the right chord over there and i was able to switch the tablet on in the Nth attempt (10+ attempts were made to charge the device but it would just vibrate once and then proceed to blackout) it started and with 1% battery indicating in the corner i got the IMEI number on the screen from the device setting and the delivery guy took picture of it and then the tablet died.

I got the new tablet as replacement and it's working good.

So who's at fault here for this headache? Amazon customer service said that the tablet will be replaced just with certificate, delivery team was more interested in starting the dead tablet to verify the IMEI number... So I guess it's the communication between the amazon and it's delivery team.; Good product as expected; The tablets display is good. Average performance. Camera gets the work done with 10x zoom doing average. Memory is okay for multitasking. It is indeed the best for its price.; All functions are as expected. P99 processor at affordable price.; Convenient to use; After 10 days of usage the tab is restarting on its own. Now ai have to go to the service center which is 50kms away.

Je suis surprise de sa rapidité et l'autonomie de batterie Samsung offre vraiment de la qualité à bon prix.; What I like..........Nice size, span a grip with one hand, easy carry. It will fly a DJI mini 2 drone. It will connect to an external HD. It does have an SD card slot and SIM card slot. And it has a real Samsung processor. Not many do. The only thing I noticed, it's not powerful enough to run Video editing software. But plays videos no problem.; Pros: Fast & smooth operation.

Cons: Texts appear blurry; eye protection mode doesn't work as intended; screen fails to register my touch 20% of the time.

Returned.; Replaced my Ipay 50 mini, which was starting to warp. This Samsung is a brand name you can't go wrong with. Built solid and lots of support to go with it.; acheter pour mon épouse qui a quelques problemes avec ses mains . donc elle est facile pour elle de la manipuler ,"

Having read many reviews online, I knew exactly what to expect from this tablet. I wanted an 8-inch tablet as my primary purpose was to read e-books, hence my first requirement was a small tablet with the best possible display. So here are my observations for anyone who is planning to buy this tablet.

Pros -
1. Excellent Display. It is the only 8-inch tablet with a Full HD+ display. No other 8-inch tablet has a resolution and PPI like this one. The display is also IPS LCD. It is adequately bright and crisp with good viewing angles. (I was waiting for the RealMe Pad Mini but it is not full HD hence opted for this.)
2. It supports dual-band Wi-Fi and there is no lag in terms of connectivity.
3. If you are clear on the fact that this is a very Mid-level Tablet in-terms of specifications, then performance wise you will not face too many issues. My sole purpose for it was to have a device for E-Books, a little media consumption and from that aspect performance is fine.
4. The tablet has a single speaker which is loud enough to hear the notification sounds. However, the audio from the 3.5mm headphone jack is excellent. It is tuned by DOLBY and will satisfy the requirements of most people.
5. Battery life is great. The tablet lasted me over 4 days on a single charge (keeping in mind that it was used mostly for reading and light YouTube viewing.)
6. The reading experience, which was the primary reason I opted for this tablet, is excellent. The tablet is not too heavy and can be held for a long time. The reading mode makes it very easy to use at night. Hardly felt any eye strain. Kindle is not good for reading PDF documents but this tablet is just perfect for it. I use an app called ReadEra for PDFs and it is just as good as can be expected.
7. Although there is no fingerprint sensor, the face unlocking feature is there. It is a bit slow but reliable even in low light.
8. The tablet came out of the box with Android version 10. It received the latest security patch as well. The system-wide dark mode works well.
9. Last but not least is the build quality. The metal body is very sturdy and the side bezels are quite narrow. Tablet is light weight hence easy to carry or held in hand without fatigue.

Cons -
1. One of the main cons is the performance. You have to buy this tablet keeping in mind that the hardware is pretty old. This is NOT a tablet for playing games or heavy work. If you limit your usage to light work, the tablet will get you through. Even then slight lags here and there are pretty noticeable.
2. Although the camera is not something I use on the tablet, the quality of these (both front and back camera) is just about average. You can take passable images and that is that. Unlike most tablets in this price range, you do get a flash light.
3. The speaker volume is not that great, luckily for me it is not a big deal but mentioning it, in case someone needs to know. It is a single speaker setup and sound quality and loudness are average.
4. Although the display is excellent, one of the most annoying thing is the Automatic/Adaptive brightness. This does not work as expected and I often have to manually adjust the brightness. I hope Lenovo fixes it soon.
5. A major con is the absence of a USB Type-C port. This tablet is still stuck with micro-USB in 2022 (the device was first released in 2019) !!! It is not a big deal in general but you have to carry an extra cable just for this one device.
6. Although the tablet comes out of the box with Android 10, it is quite possible that there won't be any further OS upgrades for this tablet considering the below-average hardware.
7. Although the battery life is quite good on this tablet, the charging time is rather long. There is no support for fast charging. The best option is to keep the device for charging when you go to bed and have it ready to use in the morning.
8. It does not feel value for money considering the performance. This tablet should ideally be around 10K.

To conclude the review, I bought the tablet as a replacement of my Kindle and I use it primarily for reading E-Books and to that extent, it is a very decent tablet. My primary requirements were size, display and battery life. As mentioned above, the display and battery life are both excellent. If you know the limitations of this device and work with that you will find it a pretty satisfactory product. (ALSO DON'T BUY THE WIFI-ONLY MODEL AND THEN CRY ABOUT THE LACK OF A SIM CARD. READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU BUY THE PRODUCT.) Kudos to AMAZON for delivering the product on time.; Well, I pondered over good 2 months on buying a tablet and which one to buy - from galaxy s6 to A10 - I just wanted a tab to separate my personal life from my work phone and laptop. And finally I bought a Lenovo m8 fhd 4gb WiFi only version, a bold move despite being a Samsung/apple fan. I have been using this for some days now and good god, I am simply happy with what I bought! I saw this tab stuttering in processing/smoothness in many reviews but it has been quite fast! I am mostly a Netflix, Reddit, Tumblr user with a lot of offline movie and music downloads and libraries, and some note taking and few games like need for speed, beach buggy racing game etc. I am extremely happy with its performanc and battery and it looks cool and stylish in hand!

Two things I wish it was better - if the back cover could have been dark metal grey becoz I am a fan of dark colours, and if the 13mp camera was a good - it is a very average camera just for the sake of clicking pictures. But for this price, this tablet in its entirety is already a gem!

I just customised the launcher with a custom one :) the screen resolution is just awesome, being FHD. I love this tab.; My expectations were quite low on this product thinking that tablets can't even handle basic games because of all the negative reviews I encountered and that I could only do my school work but this was wrong!

This is a 4gb ram and 64gb rom variant which is the best in this price segment! The processor isn't that good but it's octacore and handles mid-mild games at default settings very well! I've only played minecraft with the default settings and I experienced no lag...

Camera and speakers are average though but the speaker's loudness can be further increased through the built in Dolby audio app

Reading books on this tablet is very pleasant because of the slim bezels and premium feel of the tablet. Amazon Kindle supports dark mode for the books too so I experience no eye strain

Charging takes a looong time! That's the worst part. I wish they had a fast charger with this handset plus idk if I can use my fast charger with this. But it packs a 5k mah batter which lasts even longer and I don't feel the need to charge at regular intervals which happens frequently with phones.

Another con is that it doesn't support system wide dark mode (which will be resolved in the next android 10 update so that doesn't pose a future issue)

All in all an asset for a student as it has a huge display and numerous features with multitasking and no bloatware (so no ads) and ideal for online classes and copying notes.

Edit 2/1/21

After using it for months, I feel that this device does have flaws so decided to reduce it to a three star. Since I've already talked about the pros, I'll state the cons all together

- the UI is bs, just got the android 10 update and it made things worse, the notification bar is thinner and harder to use, the sound bar is incomplete, added bloated apps (which can be disabled but still >:( ) the only good thing about this android upgrade was system wide dark mode and support for resizeable windows which provides a more desktop like experience with mouse and keyboard

- The screen doesn't have gorilla glass which is the industry standard nowadays, as a result it got minor scratches and thereby I had to install a glass screen protector to prevent further damage.

-Camera is horrible, not suitable for scanning documents also. Images are usually blurry and lack detail when using Adobe scan. Front facing camera is average and usually does the job for online meetings

- frame drops while gaming. Low refresh rate and poor graphics card and processor but the games run well at low settings.

- The volume buttons have some sort of problem. If you press it for a second or two the volume maxes out instead of going up a bar or two and my ears pop out, thereby I have to press it cautiously which is a problem

- micro usb port!!!! Come on, its 2021

- last but not the least, this doesn't have an inbuilt messaging app and as a result, jiocall doesn't work :( I was quite disappointed when I found this, it just says connect to a valid jiofi connection and unfortunately, I didn't come across a solution.

So these are some of the problems that I've faced, if these don't pose a problem then you can go for the device, else my suggestion would be to go for the newer Samsung m7 if you can spend a few more bucks...; Tab running is good.
Features are also flexible for professional work.
Performance wise speed is excellent.
For better improvement, if eyes protection screen are more flexible then the market demand will be high about this device.; Worth cost👍; The tab did not turn on. When kept for charging the lenovo logo appears and then turns off and also does not charge."

3. It gives you 128GB with an option to increase further using SD card. Why would somebody stuck with 64GB. I do heavy download of videos for offline, 64 gb out of which almost 20GB used by OS.
4. In Android world OnePlus Oxygen OS stands out. No bloatware, clean and fast. Also promised 4 yrs updates.
5. People say G99 processor, performance is not good. I am spending around 17000 rs . I am getting decent performance for casual gaming and watch media content in good quality resolution, which I may say for most is sole purpose of tablet.
6. Tablet is mostly bought for on the go content watching. This one has very good battery backup and better than ipad ,fast charging.
7. Yes 400 nits max screen brightness, people say less for outdoor. But think how many times you go out in bright sunlight, either you watch in vehicle and in shades. Also 400 nits consumes less battery.
8. If you want tablet to be like laptop with only 17000 rs. Look for something else.
9. For students only con it does not support apple pencil kind of pencil for note taking. But then it is half the price from apple ipad 9 + apple pencil. And note taking works with cheap magnetic tip pencils.
10. Quality, the moment you hold it, it gives premium feeling.

There are several hidden features; Good product for viewing and reading.Charging is excellent and battery life long lasting.
Performance wise very good. Very smooth in handling. Money's worth.; Was looking for a basic tablet around ₹20k to read pdf books. This does that job well . Also videos from apps are good. Can play games as well (unless you are looking for high fps games with6any frame drops)

Very satisfied. Serves my purpose well.

Pros:
+Vibrant display in 7:5 magazine aspect ratio
+ Enough performance for all day today tasks
+ Sleek design
+ Good battery life
Cons:
- Fingerprint sensor on this would haveade it complete tablet; Display is very nice sound is good design and battery back up is good .. overall product is good; Superb big sized screen.It's delightful. Stunning Dolby Atmos with 4 speakers.Good processor and fine bright display.Almost a premium tablet at a bargain price.Feels like Apple iPad at a fraction of its price.; I bought this tablet to study, so on this point the tablet does its work well. The camera is very basic which I can't complain about given the price point. However, my only concerns are the battery and the delivery experience.

First of all, when I received the product two days ago, I found that the packaging was clearly tampered. The seal on the folio case was broken and though the seal was intact on the tablet's packaging case, I could still find clues it was opened before I did. I was very very concerned but because I couldn't find any noticeable damage the customer service couldn't do anything.

Secondly, the battery according to me is draining faster than what should be normal for a brand new device. For example, if I watch a video for 1.5 hours, the battery will drain from 100% to 89%. This is my first tablet so I don't know if this is normal but I am concerned that in the long run this draining will be speed up. Though the charging happens super fast. That's a good point.

The refresh rate is okay. It took me some time to get used to the slight delays and occassional stutters when scrolling, but gradually I got used to it.

Because of the large display it offers a good experience in reading and watching lectures. Overall, I think it's a good and affordable tablet for those who have basic requirements in studing and taking notes. Except I'm still anxious about the battery. I am using a capacitative stylus for note taking.; Amazing screen quality smooth touch good performance camera is also good, quick connectivity, I loved it. Charging is also good, all features are good. Feels amazing to use very classy look"

It get hang if you have Heavy apps
But as second device and with help of samsung flow I don't see it as problem.
My kids love it, spouse love it then what we want more.

Value worthy.; Using for 3 days. Lagging little due to 3 gb ram.

Reading experience is seamless. If one tires of staring small screen of mobile, then it is just like princess's hand on the eyes.

So, it is to be only used for reading pdf, kindle and epub. If it is loaded with tonnes of useless apps, games then performance will raise blood pressure.

If one needs a tab dedicated for reading and can sacrifice mindless watching of reels, notifications, Netflix, prime videos then don't delay purchase.

Gamers don't even think about it.

This is made in china, but money goes to south Korea, so Samsung is only option left.; Purchased this Tab as a large screen mobile replacement. However the functionality is limited due to device constraints.

Screen behaves like it’s 25-30 fps .

Resource heavy apps like twitter and Reddit will run into app crashes and even sluggish .

You will see under 10k base smartphone level of performance on this tab , so save money or go for better if you are looking for better performance and storage.

Form factor is good for daily usage on move , hope that Samsung updates the hardware in upcoming versions.

Software updates are fairly regular.

Received Android 13 and monthly security patches every 2 months until last month.

This is can be good for the elders who don’t mind sluggish performance but need a bigger screen due to poor eyesight.

Can also be good for office tab to fill forms or data.
But not for others who expect decent response and wiser usecases; Storage is too less at this price.; pros
1 day early delivery by Amazon, neat and sealed with secured OTP, no damages
Android 11, 3 GB and 32 GB is good enough for home usage - browse, video, games
Bought it for my dad and kids, did not want to strain their eyes by small display
with 8.7 display, looks like mini laptop, so far good UX
touch, display and audio is working as expected
Another big plus, comes with type c connector.

cons
camera is just ok, i think it is ok for school but not for great pics, i can still manage with phone
only wifi, still ok bcos i dont intend to carry this out, bought this for home usage
premium look, sometimes slippery, so better go far a good cover
no flash, so no torch option
no notification led, that is ok for home usage; I got this tab on 26 april 2023 and writing this review on 21 December 2023. This tablet is very bad because of following reasons :-

(i) Lag problem - Because of it 3 32 gb storage in which 12 gb will be taken by system storage. So only available storage to you will 20 gb. So after some months you will have to face problems. When we open internet after sometime it will get lagged because of too much notifications.

(ii) Display problem - In the side display of tablet there are yellow patches of light glow. Whenever you open any black background in tablet you will notice those yellow spots on side of the display in edges. And it is very irritating as well as very bad display. Display quality too bad. It will work as a mirror for you.

(3) Battery Backup Problem - Battery drains up fast. I noticed it. It will give you around 4 hours back up (from 100% to 20%). Charging time quite average.

(4) Tablet opening after power off/reeboot - It takes about 10-15 minutes and sometimes 20 minutes to reopen after power off or reeboot.

Therefore I am regretting after buying this tablet in 13000. It would have been better to buy Realme pad mini 4 64 where you will get more storage so no lag, good battery backup and better display."

Thankfully Samsung has stepped up their game, which is a good thing for my peace of mind. I bought this tablet many many months ago for my mother, because her main use case include reading scripts from ancient apocrypha and watching the most obscure YouTube videos known to mankind. Honestly I'd go insane if I wade through the junk that accumulates on boomer communication devices. That being said you're not here to listen to me vent, so let's get to the point.

[Display] - 4/5
It's a 10.5 inch TFT panel that carries the exceptional Samsung display quality. There is no sAMOLED functionality, and honestly I wouldn't expect it for this kind of price. The resolution is 1920x1200 which is more than enough for consuming content on a screen of this size, this includes YouTube videos, games and books. That being said this display is quite excessive for boomers who will only use the tablet for reading, you can do better buy buying a tablet half the price.

I saw a few students asking if this tablet supports the S-Pen on forums, I tested it out and no S-Pen is not supported. But I did find a few videos and posts that show people using those capacitive stylus to take notes in S-Pen and do some art. Also there is no Dex available for this tablet so keep that in mind for those that are using the tablet for studies.

[Connectivity] - 5/5
It has wifi and Bluetooth, literally all you need for home use. The connections are snappy and I haven't faced any issues setting it up, my mom haven't faced any issues either, despite her claiming that Bluetooth will cause cancer...

[Performance and Storage] - 4/5
I mean I am only giving 4/5 because it looks more critical. I don't use this device to properly stress test i, I did try playing some games on it and it seemed pretty snappy, I didn't download PUBG because my mother isn't a budding eSports pro based in Noida. It has an ""Octa Core Processor"" which is mot probably based on Unisoc architecture(arguably less reliable than Exynos and Qualcomm but that doesn't matter for light users like boomers). The most action this tablet sees is when my mother uses the Facebook app. I bought the 4GB RAM and 64 GB storage version because it is more than enough for my mother, I might add a 128GB SD card just in case she decides to install WhatsApp on it. 4GB RAM is more than enough for almost all modern applications and use cases, sure in 2023 8GB is the norm, but the tablet has not slowed down even a bot for my mother. I honestly wouldn't recommend you but this tablet for gaming if that is your primary use case.

[Camera] - 3.5/5
This is the crux of the usage for boomers, an absolute make or break situation, and honestly this tablet passes with flying colors. The front camera is positioned on the side allowing your eyes and face to be centered in a video call while the tablet is in landscape mode. This is a big win, and honestly places the tablet leagues ahead of the competition which will make you look schizophrenic during video calls as your eyes dash from side to side away from the camera. The front facing camera is 5MP and Samsung's software does a good enough job to make sure the image quality is good, I tested out a video call with my mother and the quality was very good in mediocre lighting. The rear camera is 8MP and does a very good job in scanning documents and for the average boomer, provides a good enough picture quality for those emergency neighborhood landfill photos.

I would say this is also more than enough for students who require a table to attend their online classes, because the teach ain't going to care if you look like handsome squidward. All in all the cameras perform their function to the t.

[Software] - 5/5
As far as Android tablets go in terms of software, this is the best you're gonna get. The One UI is the best out there for both power users and for boomers, and it is the thing carrying these tablets forward even with the mediocre hardware. You can multitask easily, install all sort of apps, customize the appearance of the tablet as well as program unique gestures to make life easier for the boomers who'll be using this device. If the boomer you're buying this tablet for was using another android tablet or an iPad, then transitioning to this will be no problem at all. The UI is tailor made to be as user friendly as possible. I kid you not, my mother who barely knows how to use her phone from OnePlus, uses thus tablet effortlessly. Also in my humble opinion the software is well suited for students as well, with a full version of Samsung notes available with the tablet, and many other features like the device profiles that can be set up for focus, entertainment etc. This is a testament to Samsung's software engineers, UI, and UX designers. The software alone should be enough to warrant a purchase.

Depending on when you buy the tablet you will have One UI 5.1 and Android 13 as the latest versions of the software. Anything beyond that is questionable(there will be regular security updates till 2024).

[Battery] - 5/5
It packs a 7000mAh battery that can comfortably the day on a full charge. No problem on that end.

[Conclusion] - 4.5/5
For the boomer/middle schooler in your life, this is a perfect tablet. It'll perform the functions of everything they need while making sure that anything extra will be uncomfortable enough to not pursue. Wallet friendly and very well built. I would say go for it, but with 2023 ending I'm pretty sure they'll be an upgraded option for this tablet in 2024, considering this tablet's support cycle has ended. Though if software us not a problem then you really can't go wrong with this tablet.; I've been using the Samsung Tab A8 for the past few months, and I must say, Samsung has yet again proven itself as a trustworthy brand. This tablet, while not a powerhouse, impressively handles basic functions such as entertainment, light gaming, and file management.

Pros:
1. **Best UI Experience:** Samsung's One UI provides a smooth and user-friendly interface, making the tablet a joy to navigate.

2. **3 Years of Software Update Confirmation:** Samsung's commitment to providing software updates for three years ensures your device remains secure and up-to-date.

3. **Good File Management System and Knox Security:** The tablet excels in file management, and Samsung's Knox security adds an extra layer of protection.

4. **Big Display with Good Build Quality:** The tablet boasts a generous display and solid build quality, enhancing the overall user experience.

5. **Quad Speakers with Very Loud Sound:** The audio experience is excellent with four speakers that deliver loud and clear sound, perfect for entertainment and multimedia.

Cons:
1. *TFT Display Feels Washed Out:* While the display is sizable, the use of a TFT panel results in colors that may feel less vibrant compared to other display technologies.

2. *Slow Charging with Included Charger:* The tablet's bundled 7.5V charger, despite supporting 15V fast charging, extends the charging time to 3-4 hours, which can be a bit of a drawback.

3. *Heavier Than expected:* The tablet is on the heavier side, which may not be ideal for extended one-handed use or portability.

In conclusion, the Samsung Tab A8 is a reliable choice for those seeking a tablet for everyday tasks. It might not be a top-tier performer, but its well-rounded features, secure software support, and quality user interface make it a commendable option for users who prioritize trustworthiness and functionality over cutting-edge specifications.; Pros:
1. Screen size of 10”+ at this price point is a very Good point!
2. Performance is good!
3. The speakers are amazing!
4. Knox Security included
5. Enough detailing to the tab and it feels so premium in hand!
Cons:
1. Samsung could have got an AMOLED into this price…
2. S-pen support or stylus support lacks in this device!
3. Supports fast charging but gets a 8W charger out of the box, takes a healthy time to fill the juice!
One extra note : Kuddos to team samsung for the screen, I have used A7 and now A8 initially without any cover not a single bit of scratch I noticed in the screen! Build is top notch; What i like about A8
-> Its slim
-> Metallic finish
-> Looks premium
-> Its fast enough for me, able to play most of the games and look into my notes.
-> Popup feature and shortcuts are good.
-> Battery life , will last more than a day if under normal usage (Excluding Gaming and watching high resolution videos)
-> Sound quality is awesome
-> Netflix can render HD Quality videos
-> 64 Gb is enough for me , as im not into gaming on Tab
-> great for studies.
-> close to stock android (Compared with google Pixel), did not see any bloat wear other than those apps of Samsung.

Things which could have been better
-> Fast charging (takes more than an hour to fully charge -- close to 2 hours)
-> No Sim feature , hence no calling feature
-> its heavy
-> Bezels could have been more thinner
-> Screen quality is good , but not great when compared to smart phones. But in par with other Tabs in the price segment .
-> Camera quality is OK OK , in par with other tabs in the price segment.

No regrets after buying the Tab, Its fast enough and gets the job done. Happy with what Samsung has provided."

All this for 12k? Il take that.; Firstly, wrong TAB delivered to us (instead of 8 GB - 128 GB, they delivered 6 GB - 128 GB) and moreover, no support from Amazon have to file a consumer case for this.

TAB is real disappointment

It hangs a lot and screen brightness is real issue.

I am personally very happy with the product and overall features. Worth to buy with this price for such great performance tablet.; This is a very nice tablet.. Working very smoothly..

Every use of an hour requires a lot of charging time.; There are two versions of the tablet 2/32 GB and 4/64 GB.
The 4/64 GB version is a calling tab with a sim card slot (one can refer to it as a bigger single sim smartphone). WiFi also works fine.
However, 2/32 GB version is only WiFi tab. Hence, no sim card.

I personally suggest to go for the 4/64 GB version because when compared to the latest mobile configurations and upcoming technologies such as 5G, this tablet is much behind. But, at this price range, the product justifies its value. It will work fine unless you are a heavy game user. On the other hand, relatively, 2/32 GB version is more out-of-date and as the mobile apps are getting heavy, it may have hanging/slowing-related issues, even for student education-related applications (my views).

I hope this helps. I had these doubts and was unable to find these answers here. Now reviewing after the purchase. Cheers!!; Version 4 + 64 Wifi+Volte
Using for last 2 weeks.
Pros & Cons - Voice Quality is excellent - Volume boost is really good, especially when watching videos / listening music etc - Touch response seems a bit slow/nil as compared to mobile devices - Good to use for reading purposes in dim light(15 - 20%), can be used as an alternative to kindle e readers - I don't like gaming so no information to share on that part - Charging takes long time for full charge - But battery lasts long too - Feels a bit heavy with a cover case etc. - Phone calling voice level in loud speaker/earphone connected - feel a little low as compared to mobile devices - Video calls excellent - HD videos, clarity not as good as many average level MI phones - Charger C type - Body design smooth and good looking - Have to download many additional apps for utilities like cleaner etc. Mostly it uses Google apps for contacts/calls/messages etc.; Good tab with big size, ordered 4gb 64 gb varriant

Pros:
Big screen
Good touch
No lag For normal games works good, havent tried with heavy games like pubg

Its comprehensive features make monitoring the child's activities and tracking their location effortless. The tablet's quality is excellent, with a responsive touchscreen and smooth performance. Its user-friendly interface enhances accessibility for both parents and children. Overall, I highly recommend this tablet to any parent seeking reliable parental control technology.; I bought this for my son .Since everything is online I did not wanted my kid to use mobile & hence I was looking for a tablet & I purchased this.Its easy to use & the best part is it is loaded with lot of alerts which helps in real time.It operates quiet smooth,has a 10.1 inch screen ,super clarity & has a good speaker.As a parent thisbis the best tab for kids.; This tab is a real value for money. I have checked all the features before giving it to my daughter and surprisingly, the performance is really good and the notifications received are accurate. I have tried several other parenting products earlier, so far this is the best buy. would definitely recommend this product.; The lablet has worst quality in terms of body, display, camera and battery.

Instead of 6000 mah battery, i found only 1000 mah batter installed.

The battery drains quikly within an hr of use.

Don't buy, Don't Buy; My son and I both use this tab. I will set screen time for 1 hour, and that is all he gets after coming home from school.

I've been using this for a few weeks. There have been no lags so far, and the performance is good. The 10.1 inch display is praiseworthy and the camera quality is also good.

The heroes are the parental features. Not gonna lie, it was hard to get used to that at the beginning and it took me 2-3 days to get used to those features. Once I got myself familier with everything, I finding them to be very useful. Instead of buying a random device for kids, this initiative by Enable Tab is really good.; Initially I had three tabs in my list to purchase for my kid before ending up in Enable Tablet.

Lenovo M10, Xiaomi Pad 6, Honor X8. Upon in depth research, I came across Baatu Enable.

One thing about Enable - it comes with a LTE SIM calling option and has a lot of parental monitoring features. The processor is mediatek which is pretty decent.

The major usage will be for studies, research, and gaming. Also, I am very cautious on the total hours he spends time everyday on the device. Unlike the other tab, Enable has an option to set up. And instead of just giving a notification that says that you exceed the overall time which can be ingoned in other devices, the Enable tab automatically locks once my kid exhausts the device time. Now I have set 1.15 hours as his daily screentime.

In terms of performance, there are no lags either. Coming to HD video's this plays without any lag. Video Clarity is good. Battery is good continues usage stays for 12hrs usage.

Wifi & Bluetooth connectivity is good. It also has an headphone jack.

The adult content monitor is perfect. It sends me a notification when any negative, bad and inappropirate words are dedected. Same goes with video and images.; I had zero intention to purchase a tab from a new brand like Baatu. But my friend literally forced me to do this. I found their address at google and to my surprise it was just 1km from my place. I went to their office, spoke with the owner. He refused to sell the product directly even though i was ready to pay full cash and he asked me to order online. It took them 4 days to deliver the tab even though i am just 1 km away from their office.

The reason why i am giving 5 star is only for the performance. The parental alerts are good. my daughter is using this for almost 3 months now. i find it safe and getting to know what type of content she is watching. Every feature the owner told me works exactly like he mentioned. It comes with one sim slot which is okay for kids. But if for adults, i prefer dual sim slot just like we get in phones.

The product is good. But the company should consider selling the product offline and not only in online.; Its an inexplicable feeling when you are desperate seeking a solution to a problem since months and there comes a solution with much more than you asked for!
I have a son who is about 4yrs and is studying in a Montessori. As we both parents are working professionals, its a daunting task to manage all chores along with uncompromising Parenting. There are few rules which we had set for ourselves to keep our little one occupied, happy yet be safe physically and mentally. Last week, I brought this awesome product which is *The solution* for most of my concerns!

This Baatu Tab device I have configured and handed to my son and I'm now able to track whether he is at school or has been dropped to the daycare safely post school hours by this incredible feature called Geo Fence. Incidentally, I forgot to charge the device in the morning and while he was at school, I got the notification that the battery is critically low. Hence I could personally call and keep a watch on the child.
Furthermore, by opening the application provided for the parent, I could just keep track of his current location at my wish. Also I can now keep an eye on what apps he is using and for how long. I could also set the limit on screen time day-wise. Basically, during weekends, since I'm home, I have set shorter screen time and we both spend quality time involving in some physical games. One more thing to mention here is that they claim to notify the parent if the child uses or searches any inappropriate content online.
Smarter kids of this generation needs smarter solution!
I'm so glad it also shown me the app which my son installed on the tab accidentally and I could lock that newly installed app through the Baatu parent application itself as I didn't wanted him to get exposed to it.
Now, deep inside me I'm feeling that, I'm giving him the luxury to use a smart-device with smart solution keeping him safe and secure. So Thank you Baatu for this problem-solving product!!"

Con:
Battery is drying up even when I am reading only..in one day..every night I need to charge..my previous tab ..samsung 2 gb used to afford me more battery..but given 8gb speed its understandable..
If your requirement is only reading..better go with s6 lite 4 gb which also comes with pencil. But you want some multimedia n games too..then in this price range this one is best with 8gb RAM.
I am a happy customer. 5 out of 5 stars.; 1)First of all the seal was broken.
2) I found glues are shown between screen and body on all sides of the tab,which looks like a repaired one.
3)Month and Year in the box is showing March 2024 but I found so many screen shots in image folder, whose created date is showing Nov 2023.
4)There is no temporary screen guard on the screen as new phones or tabs usually have.; I got this at a very low price of 14k so it is a value for money amazing speaker quality good screen size for this price point; Has most of the features required in the latest technology tablet. Sufficient speed, memory and picture quality.; Overall tablet is nice ...but if you are using it more than 3.5 hours...then pls dont but it.; i had bought in february and now in june no issues. Tab works smoothly ,only battery drains out quickly even if not using it so have to charge frequently."

I am using pad 2 since 1 month. Pad working nice. Sound quality is good . Amazing touch response. Battery life is more than 2 days. Full charged in 2 hours. This pad is number one at this price rate at this time.; Realme Pad 2 Tablet is a Very Very Very Good Tablet.It has all the features you require in aTablet .Very Very Smooth due to its RAM and ROM ,120 Hz Refresh Rate ,Sound Quality is Very Good and Clear loud Sound. I use it for my Online Classes and it is just Excellent. The Battery also last very long with no frequent charging and Charger provided is also Very Good Quality.
The Battery is slightly heavy which makes it difficult to hold Tablet in the Hands for a long time but as it is more than 8000mah battery ,the battery lasts for very long .Almost 3 to 4 Days without charging on normal use which is very very good.
Thank you Realme for the Wonderful and Very useful Tablet .Also Thank you to Amazon for the Fast and careful delivery
👍👍👍👍; Sound, display all are great.. good to buy..; I was planning to donate tablets to Government Schools in Karnataka and hence bought this product just to test the performance before finalising the brand/make of tablets. After using it for 2 days I am keeping this trial piece for myself and will buy more tablets for donation to Govt schools. I bought this product since it has both Wi-fi+4G. In villages wifi availability is poor but 4G SIM will help due to better Jio network. In some videos it is shown that earphone cannot be plugged into this product. But with the help of a small cable it is possible, as with many new smartphones these days.; Battery and processor very good.; This is absolutely not worth it … it is taking forever to charge and sometimes it doesnt even charge the charger that the give with this is very poorly made it only goes 70% of the way in … there are also other things like the ui and the performance they are okayish for the price not something to be praised of … about build quality its alright its not bad but i wouldnt say its good as for the camera its not good i mean they gave a module for 2 lenses and theres only one other one is empty i suggest buy some other tablet because this is not value for ur money; Good screen and great sound. Watch movies on this tablet. Battery capacity is nice too.; After one week usage every thing good and nice product from Realme"

This is a very good model with 8 GB Ram and 128 GB Memory. It also has extra microSD card supporting 1 TB storage.
The 11 Inch screen is also good and I don’t find any glare issues. I have played some games also on it and it is working okay. Don’t expect very high graphics will work.
Overall good tablet.; Good for note taking, doddling with the pen .... does everything like daily activities YouTube, pdf reading, news,..Not a gamer so don't know anything about gaming experience. but it is definitely a good choice for students in budget.; Good product for every day usage. Nice big screen at 11 Inch and good refresh rate, did not feel any lag also while using the app. The battery is also decent and I am able to use it for a day atleast at full charge!; There no good software for making notes and releases so much heat; Very impressive product, working very smoothly. Hardware and Software both are working fine. No hanging or heating problem. Screen quality is very good. Battery back is decent.
Look and feel is also very good and premium.; Got this tablet for 2 main reasons – Pen and the 4G connectivity. The tablet is good at the price, comes with good ram and storage support also
The pen works fine on the tablet and the free Nebo app is great for taking notes or converting handwriting into text to share etc.; Pros –
Good Screen Quality and Refresh Rate. The brightness also is good and color quality is great
Looks great and I love the colour
Latest Android 13 and they are promising upgrade to newer versions also (so support will be there for Android 15 also)
Wifi Connectivity is good
Good 8 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM

Cons –
Battery is only 7040 watts, can be more because you need more backup while travelling
Camera clarity not very good but it is okay for Video calls
Need to buy Pen separately.; Have been using this Tablet for a few days now.
Pros
1) Pen Available with the Tablet
2) Good Screen Size and Refresh Rate. No lag while keeping multiple apps open
3) Wifi & 4G Connectivity is good, did not face any connectivity issues
4) Screen size is perfect and display is nice

Cons
1) Pen does not magnetically attach to the Tablet. So you have to buy a tablet case or keep the pen separately.
2) Pen does not have USB Charging but works on AAAA battery"

Display is good with no extreme stress on eyes. Touch screen is soft to touch. Processor is good and works effectively with speed. I am satisfied with the product.; ; 5g Tab in most affordable price..After buying update the OS,then only touch pen will work properly.; Thy provided me an used product with touch response defect ...and next day refused to exchange rather suggested to go to service center ..... now i am thinking about consumer court; The battery life is extremely poor, draining quickly. I barely had enough time to watch a few YouTube videos and half of a movie on Netflix. Without even using it much the next day, the battery is completely drained, and by evening it's only at 20 percent. The thumb unlocking doesn't work well, and the facial recognition is terrible. Most of the time, you have to type in your password. I can't comprehend why people are so enthusiastic about this product.; Good battery backup good
Display; All of it is perfect...not for heavy gaming; This tablet is only for Arabic regions! My Country/region Is not in it. I will return this tablet and get one that has country choices..... I AM CHANGING MY REVIEW! I FIGURED IT OUT!
I was about to return it when I decided to give it another try! Luckily,
I was able to set it up easily! This tablet is wonderful! Clear picture, very thin and light weight. I am very happy with this tablet and I recommend it. 5 ✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️; Cette tablette ne fonctionne pas au Canada. J’ai parlé à un technicien de Samsung qui m’a dit de contacter Amazon. Incapable de parler à quelqu’un chez Amazon!; Very Happy With It; If you're looking to play casually. Sure. But if you're looking to play professionally or top-tier. Nope. It runs the game just fine, but the screen jitters when you move your camera. It makes precise aiming incredibly impossible sometimes the swiping is fast and sometimes it's slow, it has to do with how the screen registers where your finger is.

And if you play with a six-finger cloth or so many fingers on the screen that this doesn't even know how to sense your fingers.

If you're only looking for performance then this is good, but if you're looking to improve and accurately shoot at people, I can't recommend this.

My previous device was the Apple iPad Pro 2020 11-in and I played professionally on that.

The screen jitteriness on this one makes it almost impossible to be consistently accurate when shooting at people.; Purchased for my wife and she loves everything about it. Nice clear display, great sound quality, and quite a snappy performer. We have had several android tablets but always go back to Samsung. Connects easily to the internet and mobile hotspot from her phone so she can watch her tv shows anywhere. She is very happy and so am I, very happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone."

I had bought this tablet for Video Confering over Zoom, Google Meet and for Some Office works over MS Excel, MS Word, MS PowerPoint and few other Google Softwares and they work flawless without any lags.
You simply attach any Keyboard and Mouse over the Micro USB and it will act as a Mini Laptop.
The product is extremely sleek in design and handy to hold. The Metallic back gives it a premium look and feel.
Supports 128gb of memory card and can also be extended with the help on a OTG Pendrive.
The best part supports Dual Wifi Band (@2.4ghz and @5ghz) so you can a blazing fast speed.
No Simcard Facility.
The only con i feel is 5W Charger bundled in the box as it charges the tablet very slow, however i tried charging with A 10W charger and it charged pretty fast then a 5W.
It has very narrow bezles which makes it feel very handy, you feel holding a 7inch tablet instead a 8inch tablet in your hand that how sleek and handy it is.
A must buy product at Rs.9999/- for Day to Day minimalist Usage.
This product was tough to find. It did not show up in regular searches and only appeared when searching for ""2nd generation."" If you want an Android 10 tablet and don't need SIM calling, this is the tablet! I bought this for basic tasks: writing and Web surfing. For writing, I have purchased a Bluetooth keyboard and added a mouse. I do not play games so have no comment on that. The battery life is good and it took a couple of hours to charge fully. The Zoom app has some glitches with Android 10 but the web version works fine. Will update after a few more weeks of use.

Update after one month of use: I continue to be overall happy with this product. Video and audio quality is very good. Battery life is very good. I watched a full 45-minute YouTube video on 2% power without the tablet dying. Battery charging is fairly fast, especially if you turn off WiFi during charge. Word processing through Google Docs works fine. Zoom loads properly now on the app. The camera placement during call is not ideal. It always looks like I'm looking to the side instead of directly into the screen. It's the same problem when tablet is horizontal or vertical. Overall, happy with the purchase.; Good tablet under 6000. A little bit laggy sometimes but it is a good tab for video streaming with good display and sound quality. Serves the basic purposes like entertainment, reading e books and listening to music. Worth the buy if you have tight budget😃😃; I have been using the Lenovo Tab M8 HD Tablets for a few months now, and I am very impressed with its features and performance. This tablet is very sleek and lightweight, with a metal body and an 8-inch HD display. It has a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels, which delivers crisp and clear visuals. It also has an IPS panel, which offers wide viewing angles and vivid colors. The tablet is very powerful, as it has a MediaTek Helio A22 processor, which can handle multiple tasks and apps smoothly. It also has 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 128 GB with a microSD card. The tablet runs on Android 9 Pie, which is fast and user-friendly. It also has a long battery life, as it can last up to 18 hours on a single charge. The tablet is very versatile, as it has a Wi-Fi only connectivity, which allows me to browse the internet, stream videos, play games, and more. It also has a 5 MP rear camera and a 2 MP front camera, which are good for taking photos and video calls. It also has dual speakers with Dolby Audio, which provide rich and immersive sound. It also has a face unlock feature, which is convenient and secure. The tablet is also very affordable, compared to other tablets in the market. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone who wants a sleek and powerful tablet for their entertainment and productivity. It is a great product from Lenovo.; Very good product for this price; Screen quality for good, camera was as good. Battery backup was good.; Like the look; we brought two taps for kids, cant even handle one app at a time (youtube) , cant play games (normal one kids games).
its really laggy. not even fast enough, this sucks, i want to exchange this and buy new one before that i just want to give others review (idk there is exchange policy or not?); "

Here is my initial review

1. Build Quality: Very good metal back which makes it look premium in hand.

2: Screen: Quality is very good for the price. SAMSUNG is known for it's displays.

3. Battery: Quite good battery life. I didn't measure it exactly but seems pretty good.
Also FAST CHARGING is supported but the you need to buy a fast charger separately as the box contains only a 7.5W charger.

4. Processor: The thing I liked the most is the processor used by Samsung here...SD 662 which is far better than every other processor found in tablets in this price range. Things are butter smooth.

5. UI: One UI 2.5 is very well optimised for this tablet and the scrolling and stuff feels smooth.

6. Gaming: I tried Subway Surfers, PUBG Mobile and it felt really smooth. SO U CAN BUY THIS FOR CASUAL GAMING.

7. Buttons: I feel the power and volume buttons are little suppressed and they don't feel clickly.

8. Speakers: 4 speakers which are really really loud, probably the loudest ever I have heard on a Tablet.

9. Camera: Both cameras decent.Nothing special here.

Other Things:

1. Dolby Atmos support is there.

2. Headphone jack quality is good.

3. MicroSD card support is there.

PS: I bought the tablet for 17K with 2K cashback and 9 month no cost EMI.
So effective cost is 15K.

I think it is a great deal.; When it comes to budget tablets the choices are very less since no one except brand like Apple took this category to the next level. With that the prices went up as well and it made even harder for normal users to even consider using those devices and this is where Samsung totally nailed it.

Now, I know the specification may not look that attractive but you need to ask ask yourself few following questions-

No 1. Do you own a decent phone?
No 2. Are you looing for something which can be used for video, media consumption?
no 3. Are you low on budget?

If all your answers are YES then you are looking at the right product. Let me tell you one thing don't have any high expectations like doing intensive task , playing games etc. Whatever specification is provided is more then adequate for your daily activities. However, I did face some occasional frizz while using chrome on desktop mode but it gets the job done. I would have loved to see if Samsung provided better optimization for tabs like this. I have zero complains for it's hardware. It feels extremely well build. It has a modern look to it. The best part has to be it's display. Samsung has always been winner in this part. Even though it has an LCD display. Trust me you will not regrade it. In hand feeling is quite premium. The best thing about the tab is the aspect ratio. I have seen others using bigger and expensive tabs. Whenever I see them playing a video there is a thick black border which takes away the experience of having a high resolution big screen. In this tab it's quite minimal plus most videos plays full screen. It has a support for widevine l1. with quad speaker and superb battery. It takes the experience to the next level. Trust me when you buy this it will surely put a smile on your face. back camera is okyish. Nothing much to talk about. I don't thing the processor and RAM is a deal breaker anyway since we are talking about a TAB.
So, Do I recommend it?
The answer is obvious and a big YES. Totally value for money. Just go for it. .Wrote everything after using the tab personally for long time which puts me in a situation of writing this. Thank you..

Lastly, Thank you Amazon for quick delivery. You have done phenomenal job in this covid situation. Thank you..; Very decent design tab with bright screen visible in outdoor also, touch response is very nice, camera front and back is normal, image quality is not so good but decent in this price point, sound output is best in this price range, battery backup of tab is not so good but last upto 3 hours in continuous video playback, processing speed is decent no lag is there in usage for daily tasks. Built is best as it belongs to samsung. Definitely buy it.; I ordered for my 3 year old daughter who is attending nursery classes online, earlier I was using a laptop but it was a little difficult to use for a 3 year old kid, samsung tab A7 is a budget tab with good bright screen, good processor (snapdragon) very loud quad speaker, good front camera for video calls, main camera is avg of course of no use in tabs. Better life is good, with full charge you can attend 3-4 day class with light usages. Weight is normal, I used a tempered glass and a back cover which is after market.overall a good product at this price point, I got it at 15 k in offer of HDFC.
My requirement was SD processor, fast charging support, good big battery 7k amh, this tab fulfilled all.
One more thing although the tab support a fast charge of 15watt , it comes with a normal charger which is quite disappointing. I had a samsung mobile charger of 15 watt which I am using for it. 4/5 star over all."

Thank you Realme for the Wonderful and Very useful Tablet .Also Thank you to Amazon for the Fast and careful delivery
👍👍👍👍; Sound, display all are great.. good to buy..; I was planning to donate tablets to Government Schools in Karnataka and hence bought this product just to test the performance before finalising the brand/make of tablets. After using it for 2 days I am keeping this trial piece for myself and will buy more tablets for donation to Govt schools. I bought this product since it has both Wi-fi+4G. In villages wifi availability is poor but 4G SIM will help due to better Jio network. In some videos it is shown that earphone cannot be plugged into this product. But with the help of a small cable it is possible, as with many new smartphones these days.; Battery and processor very good.; This is absolutely not worth it … it is taking forever to charge and sometimes it doesnt even charge the charger that the give with this is very poorly made it only goes 70% of the way in … there are also other things like the ui and the performance they are okayish for the price not something to be praised of … about build quality its alright its not bad but i wouldnt say its good as for the camera its not good i mean they gave a module for 2 lenses and theres only one other one is empty i suggest buy some other tablet because this is not value for ur money; Good screen and great sound. Watch movies on this tablet. Battery capacity is nice too.; After one week usage every thing good and nice product from Realme"

We purchased the TAB and along with flip cover , but the flip cover did not fit for the TAB. We tendered the replacement, even though the replaced flip cover also did not suit for theTAB.

2. The chareger for the TAB is not sutable to it, while it is charging, the tab and the charger are producing hest, hence we purchase another charger and used to charge for TAB.

3. There is no return policy , only replace policy is available.
It is very unfortunate that there are not available for return policy.

4. We are the unlucky customer for the Said TAB.; Charger overheating problem and slow charging; Average quality, below average picture quality because it comes with hd display only, better screen size, above average battery backup; 10.1 screen, all basic features available good to go; Lightweight, good audio and video quality. However, if you like loud music you have to pair it with a Bluetooth speaker. Charger works fine. You get the old Nokia type USB and adaptor. (Not type C) The pattern lock doesn't function properly when your device is charging. So make sure you use a PIN or password instead of pattern. If you try to deactivate Auto rotate and fix a portrait or landscape mode, you might be disappointed. Doesn't work with apps like ZEE5 and Jio Cinema. I would give it 6.5 out of 10.; Value for money"

Also some office work can be achieved.
Charging takes long and battery does deplete fast if the display brightness is kept high.
Sound wise the speaker media volume is on the low side- my phone is louder. And the call audio quality suffers from some intermittent echo.
Touch and colours are nice enough.
The cover and screen guard that come together with are convenient but the screen guard is not DIY. Mine got way too many bubbles. If you're not practiced with it best take it to a professional to get the job done.; Very amazing product with child lock facilities
Gifted my brother and he is just enjoying it!; Lenovo tab uploaded with lots of application of no use, they occupied almost 18 GB space out of 64GB which is so high. This tab is full of glitches and doesn't work properly. It gets hang and freeze the screen until battery dies. Also get switch off in the middle of work even after having good charged battery. Also phone doesn't work; neither voice reach other side nor comes in clearly. Phone call gives so much disturbance.
Now it is not getting switch on after getting switch off in the middle of my work.
So Disappointed. Just Waste of Money, time and Efforts.
It is not worth buying - Not Even 1%.; Awesome product, good sound ,charging ,it's worth; It is not good; For now its charge as fast

Battery life is ok. Last for 2 days with moderate use. Speaker is not so good but audible. Needs to be improved; ; Senior citizens using it. All expectations are fulfilled.; the design, screen and usage experience is great, but i was disappointed by the quality of selfie camera, which is blurry, and video call quality is worse. Audio is very good.; good performance. But on network side it is a little bit weaker due to the older processor.; Pros:
1. Blot apps are very low. You'll almost get a pure Android experience with very minimal Lenovo apps.
2. Processor is really very fast for daily usage app. It doesn't feel that we are using mediocre SD 6 series processor. Maker did great optimisation of other hardwares of the tablet with the processor.
3. Battery backup is great.
4. I tested internet speed of the tablet with 5g network. It performed like premium 5g devices. Latency was too low and downloading speed was touching upto 0.9 to 1 Gbps in non peak hours (that will definately vary on location).
5. Audio calls were good. No lacking in switching between 5g to volte during call.
6. Split Screen was OK. Orientation sensor is working fine too.

Average things:
1. Both cameras are very average and basic.
2. Charging technique and charger both are belonging from old gen. machines. Performs very slow.
3. Display and it's brightness both are mediocre.

Cons:
1. Both sound outputs (inbuilt dual speaker and 3.5mm jack) are very bad. Music lover will simply hate that. You can fix only one output quality ie. You can use usb type c for audio output or bluetooth connection which will give great external sound output experience but inbuilt speaker of tablet will disappoint you alot in terms of sound quality and sound level.
2. Biggest disadvantage for me is, it doesn't deliver highspeed internet (90 Mbps plus) to your other devices when you'll connect your other devices with the tablet's wifi hotspot. Although it transmits dual band frequency (5GHz and 2.4 GHz) but it is not able to give downloading speed in your other paired device more than 60 to 90 Mbps. My indication is very clear. For an example, if you're touring in a car and you're using 5g sim in this tablet so that you and your family can enjoy ""high speed internet"" on individual devices through wifi hotspot of this tablet than this won't become true ever in this tab. Even you don't have option to choose preference in btween 2.4 and 5GHz band. I have raised this issue with Lenovo service team but they are very much untrained to resolve this. They take too much time to respond and ultimately they will stop responding when they see they have left a bug in their system. I don't think any update will fix this issue. I am again repeating, it transmits 5Ghz bandwidth frequency (when you use hotspot of the tablet) but doesn't deliver high speed data to any of your wifi5 or wifi6 enabled device. If you'll connect 3 devices than every connected device will get downloading speed below the HSPA network, forget about 4g speed in those devices.

Verdict:
For basic study: 4.5/5

For elder members of family (who doesn't have hearing issues) : 4/5

For music lover: 0/5 (if using external speakers), 2/5 (if you're using aux based headphones), 5/5 (if you're using high quality usb-c to aux converter or bluetooth headphones, speakers etc.)

For multimedia content (in terms of display only): 3/5

Internet Speed on this device while using with wifi/5g connection: 5/5
Internet speed on other connected device(s) with this tablet's 5g sim: 1.5/5

Battery 4.5/5

Gps: 5/5

Calling and messaging: 4.5/5

Processor performance (when comparing this to other SD695 and 8GB RAM based devices): 5/5

Conclusion: one who is looking for 5g enabled budget tablet, I will say please wait for few more months (if you're not in hurry) because as of now, no budget 5g tablet are giving expected outcomes."

As I have never used honor product nor anyone I know has any honor product.
But from last almost a year i used to see this product on sale @ 18999 6gb ram 128gb storage with 12 inch screen this is what attracted from day 1. So I kept making up and then changing my mind.
Lastly bought this month on sale Aug 2023.
1st attractive thing is huge display at this price there is no 12ich tablet display available lesser than 45k (32-35 k during sale) and that's Samsung s7 fe tab , if u have that kind of money to spare go with Samsung s7 fe during sale of BBD its sold 32k it's better tablet. But if you don't wanna spare that much like me, then blindly go with Honor pad 8 for huge immersive display.
2nd attractive thing is 6gb ram , due to which there is no lag it's very smooth experience I get everytime I have used.
3rd attractive thing is the gaming experience, I have installed games like Dead target, Alto Odyssey, shadow fight4 ,asaphalt 8 and 9, WCC2, Fifa mobile, bowling crew, Subway surfer , tennis open 23 and temple run 2. Due to the big and smooth screen I enjoyed all the games like I have never enjoyed before.
4th attractive thing is the speaker sound of this tablet, it's amazing sound like I have never heard before on any portable device like phone tablet laptop. U won't need an external speaker and it's a surround sounding speaker.
5th attractive thing is it's a very good looking tablet, as it's huge and very thin/slim. Looks very nice 👍
6th attractive thing is 128 GB storage, I have counted , I have downloaded 36 app from Play Store after I bought this tab and it's excluding pre installed apps. Now it shows 31.73 Gb used of 128GB. Which mean after downloading 36 apps that includes OTT apps , social media apps, browser and games , I still have 96.27 GB left .
6th attractive thing is the battery, I have used this tablet 3-4 hrs a day .. and I charge it every 3rd day. I am charging this with a 10 watt charger which I had extra it takes an hour long than 22.5 watt. But battery drains very slowly when I charge with a 10 watt charger.

Camera is of no use for me in a tablet so I don't care. If someone wanna buy a tab for camera due to some reason then don't buy this . This tab has Almost an unusable camera in 2023

The only con for me in this tablet is that the 12 inch display has potential to play in good quality videos. Like on Netflix , Prime video, disney plus Hotstar, jio cinema videos looks amazing .
But on YouTube when I play songs they play at 1080 p but as the screen is big the quality of the video is not very clear.
Like I played chaleya from Jawan and that song was little hazy(little pixelated) , I think if YouTube videos could be played at 1440 p then it would look good on this 12inch tab, but as this has snapdragon 680, so it won't play at 1440p for any video, 1080p is the highest that this chipset can play. But don't get me wrong it's definitely watchable and some videos have that 1080p enhanced for YouTube premium users those videos look wonderful but as if now it's not available on all songs and videos

But at 18999 rs I cannot complain much
I wanted a 12 inch display tab so I got it .
And I am very happy with this tab
With amazing surround sound and butter smooth ui experience it feels a premium tab.
Note: if u buy this tablet then buy Robustrion tempered glass and back cover, not much options are available but I saw its sold by the same seller who sold this tab to me on Amazon- Appario so i ordered and it's little on the higher side on price like 699+799 , but it will go on for years cz of quality.; First of all, removed one Star as it doesn't have expandable memory slot and no charger (though mentioned clearly in product description)

Tablet is fast and responsive touch screen. Display is resonably good. The screen is large, which is ideal for my purpose. But due to large size and weight, may be difficult to carry around. Battery Backup is good.

Overall a good tablet, if 128 gb (available memory after all app installation is 80-90GB) storage is enough for you.; ; Best products for student👩‍🎓 💯💯💯👍; I bought this product for my son home study purpose. It is very nice quality in resolution and sound output. Its sound is very loud and clear.; After using it for month, more or less happy with it. Value for money, screen resolution is good, sound is not bad and over all good value for money, battery life is good but not the charging time. Some issues are, surprisingly few apps from play stores are not being supported with this device. Face ID recognition is not good at all. If the light is down a little, face recognition doesn’t work. Auto time zone detection is missing. Auto Rotation is not working all the time. Anyhow these are minor ones and hopefully they resolve them soon; These two are only two good things going for this tablet. 60hz screen, i don't mind it. The software comes without bloatware but it's bland and feature less. I would go as far as to say Xiaomi ui and software is better even if it's bloated. The applock is garbage, software support is also over i think and you can't put custom roms because it cannot be rooted. Now I don't root phones or tablets but I had to consider it after seeing the bland features and functionality honor was offering. Go for x9 instead of this or better go for xiaomi or redmi pads.; Thanks lot for such lowest price and best smart features.
So smooth hassle-free leg free performance..multi tasking etc all good"

I am not a gamer (my gaming runs to a round of Sudoku, and that too when I get the time for it). I do not have much use for a precision stylus or so. My main uses involve reading PDF files; writing; and occasionally watching a Youtube video. So I needed a tab that was lightweight, reasonably fast, with a good screen, good storage capabilities and, most crucially, long battery life. I am happy to say this tab more than checks all my boxes.

The screen resolution is excellent, more than adequate for my purposes. I prefer IPS screens to OLED; they tend to consume less battery while still yielding a decent viewing experience. The 120Hz refresh rate makes for smooth scrolling when viewing high-resolution image-based PDFs. So far the battery life has proved excellent. I tend to charge it about once in three to four days. For some reason the Amazon page does not specify SD cards of what capacity can be used. Other sites say it supports 1TB cards, which is more than ample for me (NB: I've not bought a card for it so far). The tab is also lightweight; it causes minimal discomfort even when I hold it in my hands and read or view videos in bed for extended periods. Lenovo's productivity mode deserves to be commended. Used in conjunction with opensource software like Collabora Office, it offers a decent work environment, which is all the more notable because Android was created keeping altogether different purposes in mind. But even without productivity mode, the Mac-style taskbar delivers a decent if limited office experience.

UPDATE: THE P11 (2ND GEN) DOES HAVE A 3.5 MM HEADPHONE JACK!! DO NOT BE MISLED BY ERRONEOUS REVIEWS. For some reason Amazon's listed the P11 (2nd gen) and the older P11 Plus on the same page. The P11 Plus does not have a headphone jack. And the reviews and answers to questions that say there's no headphone jack were all written with the P11 Plus in mind. I REPEAT, THE P11 (2ND GEN) HAS A 3.5 MM HEADPHONE JACK, AND IT WORKS JUST FINE!!

I have some grouses, though:

1. Some apps don't function well in productivity mode.
2. Why aren't official Lenovo keyboards, or even third-party keyboards, available anywhere on Amazon or the Lenovo India website?

These shortcomings are not dealbreakers (I'm sure I'll be able to buy keyboards sooner than later). All in all, a very satisfactory deal, excellent value for money if you're not looking for high-octane gaming.; Good product but quite heavy for daily use.; ; I ignored the reviews mentioning about the problem with wifi turning off automatically very often, but it is real and very annoying to dismiss the wifi popup every few minutes once.
It's a manufacturing defect so don't go for this !odel. It's going to be defective.; The Lenovo P11 plus tab is a decent device for daily reading, entertainment or even office work (in productive mode and with an external keyboard and mouse).
The build quality although is not refined as the iPads (which I have been using since past 10 years) but then no one gets to lay their hands on a good tablet at this price point. I was somewhat circumspect about the buying choice given that I have never used an android device before. I just bought it off a whim and also the fact that it would give me an experience with an android device. So far I am happy with it.

The battery life is decent and lasts almost the whole day of continuous use. Touch screen is responsive and the best part is that Lenovo P11 plus does not have any junk applications and bloat ware. The interface is intuitive and it took me just a couple of hours of playing with it to get familiar. The chipset is also decent although it’s not the best there could but so would be the associated price.
It’s a tablet that is suitable for everyone and for everyday use - students, casual mobile gamers, office goers.
Surprisingly after connecting to my apple keyboard and mouse, I have not used my laptop since I bought this tablet.
Primarily I bought it to allow me to read my vast collection of eBooks and as an aid for online study.

I would even recommend the Lenovo precision 2 stylus pen for this tab although it’s currently out of stock at most retailers. (I bought it from an official Lenovo supplier separately and am so happy with it.)
Overall a decent Tablet which i would recommend for anyone who needs an affordable device for their basic needs.; ; Pros:
1. Affordable range
2. Good for simple gaming
3. Good for browsing
4. Compatible with Lenovo Precision Pen 2
5. Thin bazzels and premium built
6. 2K display
7. Good for office use with productivity mode.

Cons:
1. Poor Camera quality at this price range
2. No fingerprint sensor iPad 9th gen has it at this price range
3. No headphone jack again iPad 9th gen has it
4. Social medias are not programmed for tablet usage

The product has its ups and downs but overall one can easily find its usage in everyday tasks.

After 6months of usage I find this product quite useful in all my work. It is light weight so easily can be carried around. Great for binge-watching content online. Unfortunately though without any headphone jack you are forced to use Bluetooth devices for having any conversation otherwise in case your blue device runs out of battery it would be in loudspeaker.; All features are well 🙂"

I hope you get the idea from it go for higher it will be more better than this and; This review is not for product but the delivery and return process of amazon. Ordered this tablet and found out that this one is not charging at all, so called the amazon customer support and they said 'no worries, get a diagnostic report from samsung service centre and with that certificate, return the product'. So i went to samsung care and the guys over there helped getting me the diagnostic report certificate named ""dead on arrival"" (DOA).

Now, i called the amazon customer support and they arranged pickup for return of tablet (with DOA certificate) and delivery of new tablet. And here comes the paradox... (Remember why i was returning the tablet? It wasn't charging, and so it was literally dead on battery)
The delivery guy says he needs to see the IMEI number on the device in the 'about device' menu on the battery dead tablet, i said it is impossible since the tablet won't start. He said 'then I can not complete the process' and left.

I again made a call to amazon customer service and the guy on the line said 'sir, you are our prime member, we'll have it sorted in 24 hrs' and again arranged the pickup + delivery.

Again the loop started, the delivery guy wanted the IMEI number on dead tablet and without that he wouldn't process the delivery of new tablet.
I was stuck in this paradox of showing IMEI number of the dead device by going to about section of device which needs it to get powered up first (that the tab obviously can't)

But this delivery guy was considerate enough, he said, let's try putting it on charge and even if I get pic of that 'about device' menu that shows the IMEI number, I'll process the return right away. My luck struck the right chord over there and i was able to switch the tablet on in the Nth attempt (10+ attempts were made to charge the device but it would just vibrate once and then proceed to blackout) it started and with 1% battery indicating in the corner i got the IMEI number on the screen from the device setting and the delivery guy took picture of it and then the tablet died.

I got the new tablet as replacement and it's working good.

So who's at fault here for this headache? Amazon customer service said that the tablet will be replaced just with certificate, delivery team was more interested in starting the dead tablet to verify the IMEI number... So I guess it's the communication between the amazon and it's delivery team.; Good product as expected; The tablets display is good. Average performance. Camera gets the work done with 10x zoom doing average. Memory is okay for multitasking. It is indeed the best for its price.; All functions are as expected. P99 processor at affordable price.; Convenient to use; After 10 days of usage the tab is restarting on its own. Now ai have to go to the service center which is 50kms away. Now I am doubting the products sild by Amazon.; J'adore cette tablette pas trop grosse juste parfaite je peux faire plusieurs choses en même temps plusieurs applications ouverte et aucun bogue.La caméra n'est pas fameuse mais bon On peut relié nos appels et messages textes de notre téléphone dessus. Le son est bon n'as pas de stylet par contre. Il se peut que vous ne réussissez pas à mettre Canada comme pays choisissez l'Australie et français ça ne change rien. Je suis surprise de sa rapidité et l'autonomie de batterie Samsung offre vraiment de la qualité à bon prix.; What I like..........Nice size, span a grip with one hand, easy carry. It will fly a DJI mini 2 drone. It will connect to an external HD. It does have an SD card slot and SIM card slot. And it has a real Samsung processor. Not many do. The only thing I noticed, it's not powerful enough to run Video editing software. But plays videos no problem.; Pros: Fast & smooth operation.

The e-ink screen is great, and I adore its design, its aesthetic. It's a pleasure to look at, just beautiful.

The writing experience is the best in the e-ink category.
Its e-ink so no eye strain, totally replaces paper for me.
It has no backlight, so using a portable book lamp.

This is a device that is focused on the philosophy of Focus.
This is no Kindle Scribe and there are very few features when compared to onyx boox tab series which is a proper android tablet with an e-ink screen. There are 13.3-inch e-ink devices as well. There are more than 10 brands making these kinds of e-ink devices.

My decision to choose this product was simply because the remarkable 2 has the best writing feel plus the incredible design.

This device is for those who want to avoid digital screens due to eye strain.
And devices such as these make Paper redundant in the digital age.

It's expensive but I have used my kindle extensively for more than a decade without any issues and makes Life incredibly convenient. No more heavy stacks of books and notebooks that I have to manage.; I bought this a few days ago. I am a writer and at any given time I have at least 4 notebooks with different things in it. This is extra confusing, because I suffer from ADHD. This e-notebook has replaced all my other books for taking notes, writing my novel and all of my lists — all in one place! It’s amazing!
But please understand that it will NOT replace your iPad/laptop or phone.
It has no apps and it’s almost solely for writing and sketching.
Yes you could read, but since it doesn’t support kindle but it will not replace your kindle/book reading electronic devices.
Cons:
- the edges gives out raggedy handwriting which is a bit annoying but I write away from it.
- the marker plus pen is heavy and I prefer lighter pens since I write a LOT and after a while, my hand starts cramping. You could use a different pen with the pen tips but I personally haven’t tried that yet.
- it’s black and white. With my physical notebook, I like to use coloured pens to add titles and subtitles. But I can’t with this device. You could use different writing formats like the marker and the calligraphy pen to make up for this but I personally would have liked a coloured screen.
- The folio doesn’t have a slot for the pen so when you close the folio flap, the pen that’s attached to the device sticks out and could easily fall and be lost.
- it’s touchscreen is rudimentary when compared to tablets so it’s slow clicks will take some getting used to.
- quick notes cannot be individually added into folders which is annoying. Only notebooks can. Also, the quick notes are all arranged in the same tab. So if I have one quick note and then at another time, I take another quick note, it won’t show up separately on the main files section. You have to click on the one tab for it and then choose the page from the menu tabs.

Note: these cons are annoying but NOT a deal breaker for me to replace my physical notebooks. I have replaced them all with the remarkable 2 and I have NO regrets!; Remarkable2 is an amazing product and with this e-ink technology one can save lot of papers.
I bought this for my husband who loves to write and he is in love with this product.
He can write notes with his handwriting using remarkable2 and it’s pen. Notes are easy to manage in different folders and search is quite easy.

I highly recommend this for people who loves to write during meetings, or casual talks with your own handwriting. There is so much comfort in writing and managing notes.; ; This tablet is amazing, like nothing I've ever seen before. Everyone who sees it, wants one. I really want the keyboard but it's hard to justify the price after spending this much. However, I'm sure it's worth it, just like this purchase was worth it.

I finally feel some sort of handle on my ADHD need for all the productivity items hahahaha; Recomendable; Entregado antes de lo agendado. Muy buen precio y servicio; The ReMarkable2 is making my life easier daily. I am still learning to use it and leverage the features it contains yet in a few short weeks it is making my work/side hustle/personal life easier. A few simple positives:
It is simplistic. It does one thing and it does it well.
It is distraction free.
Basic usage is intuitive.
Intermediate usage is pretty intuitive with a little guidance.
I still need to dive into training videos to become a power user.
I appreciated the packaging came in recyclable containers.
The ability to write, erase, and move text is super simple.
Organizing is easy once you understand the Folder/Notebook/Quick Sheets structure.

I spent 3 days in a seminar recently. I was able to download the PDF notebook (over 200 pages of documents) into my ReMarkable and then write my notes on the document. I will upload the document back to Dropbox to save/print off later. I had the option of writing my notes on the document or using a Layer (think clear sheet) that I could write on and turn the 2nd layer off if I wanted to see the main document without my notes. That wasn't an issue for me. Later, I did have one page with checklists I needed to use 3 times so I chose to use the Layers for each use and then remove them when I didn't need it anymore.

At work, I have a weekly meeting that traditionally has been one sheet of paper per week and then keeping up with each piece of paper as I needed to go back and review. With the Notebook feature, I now have those meeting notes going into one document that I will add to each week. It's easy to find and no lost pieces of paper. I also have a coaching practice and this allows me to keep notes on clients in one running document instead of multiples I must file and track.

Two things for the creators to consider - first, it would be easier to read downloaded documents with a lighter/color screen. That said, the existing screen didn't stop me from accomplishing what I wanted to accomplish. Second, a pen loop would be helpful as the magnetic pencil can come unattached. That said, placing the ReMarkable with the binder edge down and pencil on top in my bag helps.

I think I have now sold 6 of these to family and friends. At the recent conference there were a few of us who had the ReMarkable2 and we met during a break to share notes and unanimous enthusiasm for this tool.

It is fantastic.; Me ha gustado la interfaz, responde a la escritura como si fuera papel, práctica de tamaño y aunque un poquito pesada es adecuado para transporte.

Me permite fácilmente anotar y convertir a texto si deseo, la aplicación de mi lap y celular (macbook y iPhone) es muy buena, genial para presentar en zoom lo que escribes o haces diagramas, etc.

Bueno para organizar y he cargado algunos libros en PDF y ebook (no de kindle) para leer, la interfaz con power point y word es genial!!! te permite mandarlo a tu reMarkable en un click y ahí trabajarlo, hacer anotaciones, etc. y ya regresar a retrabajarlos después.

Ideal para tener un lugar sin distracciones, no sustituye un ipad y eso es bueno, ya que sustituye el montón de libretas, post it, etc. que tenía por todos lados.

En la relación costo - producto si la veo algo elevada de costo, no por mucho pero si la compraría de nuevo.

Batería buena duración, lo que tengo miedo es que no hay soporte para México para cuando termine mi suscripción anual, espero no tener problemas..."

I am not a gamer (my gaming runs to a round of Sudoku, and that too when I get the time for it). I do not have much use for a precision stylus or so. My main uses involve reading PDF files; writing; and occasionally watching a Youtube video. So I needed a tab that was lightweight, reasonably fast, with a good screen, good storage capabilities and, most crucially, long battery life. I am happy to say this tab more than checks all my boxes.

The screen resolution is excellent, more than adequate for my purposes. I prefer IPS screens to OLED; they tend to consume less battery while still yielding a decent viewing experience. The 120Hz refresh rate makes for smooth scrolling when viewing high-resolution image-based PDFs. So far the battery life has proved excellent. I tend to charge it about once in three to four days. For some reason the Amazon page does not specify SD cards of what capacity can be used. Other sites say it supports 1TB cards, which is more than ample for me (NB: I've not bought a card for it so far). The tab is also lightweight; it causes minimal discomfort even when I hold it in my hands and read or view videos in bed for extended periods. Lenovo's productivity mode deserves to be commended. Used in conjunction with opensource software like Collabora Office, it offers a decent work environment, which is all the more notable because Android was created keeping altogether different purposes in mind. But even without productivity mode, the Mac-style taskbar delivers a decent if limited office experience.

UPDATE: THE P11 (2ND GEN) DOES HAVE A 3.5 MM HEADPHONE JACK!! DO NOT BE MISLED BY ERRONEOUS REVIEWS. For some reason Amazon's listed the P11 (2nd gen) and the older P11 Plus on the same page. The P11 Plus does not have a headphone jack. And the reviews and answers to questions that say there's no headphone jack were all written with the P11 Plus in mind. I REPEAT, THE P11 (2ND GEN) HAS A 3.5 MM HEADPHONE JACK, AND IT WORKS JUST FINE!!

I have some grouses, though:

1. Some apps don't function well in productivity mode.
2. Why aren't official Lenovo keyboards, or even third-party keyboards, available anywhere on Amazon or the Lenovo India website?

These shortcomings are not dealbreakers (I'm sure I'll be able to buy keyboards sooner than later). All in all, a very satisfactory deal, excellent value for money if you're not looking for high-octane gaming.; Good product but quite heavy for daily use.; ; I ignored the reviews mentioning about the problem with wifi turning off automatically very often, but it is real and very annoying to dismiss the wifi popup every few minutes once.
It's a manufacturing defect so don't go for this !odel. It's going to be defective.; The Lenovo P11 plus tab is a decent device for daily reading, entertainment or even office work (in productive mode and with an external keyboard and mouse).
The build quality although is not refined as the iPads (which I have been using since past 10 years) but then no one gets to lay their hands on a good tablet at this price point. I was somewhat circumspect about the buying choice given that I have never used an android device before. I just bought it off a whim and also the fact that it would give me an experience with an android device. So far I am happy with it.

The battery life is decent and lasts almost the whole day of continuous use. Touch screen is responsive and the best part is that Lenovo P11 plus does not have any junk applications and bloat ware. The interface is intuitive and it took me just a couple of hours of playing with it to get familiar. The chipset is also decent although it’s not the best there could but so would be the associated price.
It’s a tablet that is suitable for everyone and for everyday use - students, casual mobile gamers, office goers.
Surprisingly after connecting to my apple keyboard and mouse, I have not used my laptop since I bought this tablet.
Primarily I bought it to allow me to read my vast collection of eBooks and as an aid for online study.

I would even recommend the Lenovo precision 2 stylus pen for this tab although it’s currently out of stock at most retailers. (I bought it from an official Lenovo supplier separately and am so happy with it.)
Overall a decent Tablet which i would recommend for anyone who needs an affordable device for their basic needs.; ; Pros:
1. Affordable range
2. Good for simple gaming
3. Good for browsing
4. Compatible with Lenovo Precision Pen 2
5. Thin bazzels and premium built
6. 2K display
7. Good for office use with productivity mode.

Cons:
1. Poor Camera quality at this price range
2. No fingerprint sensor iPad 9th gen has it at this price range
3. No headphone jack again iPad 9th gen has it
4. Social medias are not programmed for tablet usage

The product has its ups and downs but overall one can easily find its usage in everyday tasks.

After 6months of usage I find this product quite useful in all my work. It is light weight so easily can be carried around. Great for binge-watching content online. Unfortunately though without any headphone jack you are forced to use Bluetooth devices for having any conversation otherwise in case your blue device runs out of battery it would be in loudspeaker.; All features are well 🙂"

The 11 Inch screen is also good and I don’t find any glare issues. I have played some games also on it and it is working okay. Don’t expect very high graphics will work.
Overall good tablet.; Good for note taking, doddling with the pen .... does everything like daily activities YouTube, pdf reading, news,..Not a gamer so don't know anything about gaming experience. but it is definitely a good choice for students in budget.; Good product for every day usage. Nice big screen at 11 Inch and good refresh rate, did not feel any lag also while using the app. The battery is also decent and I am able to use it for a day atleast at full charge!; There no good software for making notes and releases so much heat; Very impressive product, working very smoothly.

Look and feel is also very good and premium.; Got this tablet for 2 main reasons – Pen and the 4G connectivity. The tablet is good at the price, comes with good ram and storage support also
The pen works fine on the tablet and the free Nebo app is great for taking notes or converting handwriting into text to share etc.; Pros –
Good Screen Quality and Refresh Rate. The brightness also is good and color quality is great
Looks great and I love the colour
Latest Android 13 and they are promising upgrade to newer versions also (so support will be there for Android 15 also)
Wifi Connectivity is good
Good 8 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM

Cons –
Battery is only 7040 watts, can be more because you need more backup while travelling
Camera clarity not very good but it is okay for Video calls
Need to buy Pen separately.; Have been using this Tablet for a few days now.
Pros
1) Pen Available with the Tablet
2) Good Screen Size and Refresh Rate. No lag while keeping multiple apps open
3) Wifi & 4G Connectivity is good, did not face any connectivity issues
4) Screen size is perfect and display is nice

Feels like using very heavy machinery.
It takes almost more than 3 hours to charge completely ❗
And the company provides us a charger which can't charge even a mobile phone properly 😡
How shameless ❗
We don't get some basic features like capturing screen shot with 3 fingers, etc😲
The Tab can't run even some of its own features 🙄; Bought for kids online class. My deatiled review
Pros:
1. Display quality
2. Battery back up
3. Sound clarity
Cons:
1. Microsoft teams - during class, screen goes off like due to proximity sensor and screen never comes back during class. Creating big issue for the purpose it is bought
2. Fast charging option not available
3. Screen lagging - while playing games. Home menu clicking lags in time to go to home; Take it. Considering all the deals amazon provides as it actually becomes very affordable.
Regarding Performance
Its nice. Doesn't get stuck or hang. I haven't tested gaming. But it works well for any office work.

Battery - it actually lasts longer. Approx 7-8hrs. And in battery save mode it lasts longer.

Charger is pretty slow. It takes around 2-2.5hrs to charge fully."

The pen works fine on the tablet and the free Nebo app is great for taking notes or converting handwriting into text to share etc.; Pros –
Good Screen Quality and Refresh Rate. The brightness also is good and color quality is great
Looks great and I love the colour
Latest Android 13 and they are promising upgrade to newer versions also (so support will be there for Android 15 also)
Wifi Connectivity is good
Good 8 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM

Cons –
Battery is only 7040 watts, can be more because you need more backup while travelling
Camera clarity not very good but it is okay for Video calls
Need to buy Pen separately.; Have been using this Tablet for a few days now.
Pros
1) Pen Available with the Tablet
2) Good Screen Size and Refresh Rate. No lag while keeping multiple apps open
3) Wifi & 4G Connectivity is good, did not face any connectivity issues
4) Screen size is perfect and display is nice

Cons
1) Pen does not magnetically attach to the Tablet. So you have to buy a tablet case or keep the pen separately.
2) Pen does not have USB Charging but works on AAAA battery; As a student, this tablet has become my go-to study companion. It comes bundled with a Pen which is of great help in taking short notes or editing documents. The battery life is impressive, lasting an entire day without needing a recharge. I also wanted something with 4G Connectivity and am glad that this Tablet comes with it."

3. Out of 4gb free ram will be 1.5/1.7 gb even when no app is installed only system app will take half of ram
4. Storage is good 18 is taken by system 45.4gb is free in it.
5. Camera is most terrible both front and back I have taken photo of file word are not that sharp and visible.
6. Display is good but not sharp it's ok to see content in it
7. Not played any game on it but it can manage some what casual game no high end expectations
8. There was rarely some time display touch was not good .
9. Multitasking is good between two app Ram hold only 5/6 app in background more than that is not handled it will stop

I hope you get the idea from it go for higher it will be more better than this and; This review is not for product but the delivery and return process of amazon. Ordered this tablet and found out that this one is not charging at all, so called the amazon customer support and they said 'no worries, get a diagnostic report from samsung service centre and with that certificate, return the product'. So i went to samsung care and the guys over there helped getting me the diagnostic report certificate named ""dead on arrival"" (DOA).

Now, i called the amazon customer support and they arranged pickup for return of tablet (with DOA certificate) and delivery of new tablet. And here comes the paradox... (Remember why i was returning the tablet? It wasn't charging, and so it was literally dead on battery)
The delivery guy says he needs to see the IMEI number on the device in the 'about device' menu on the battery dead tablet, i said it is impossible since the tablet won't start. He said 'then I can not complete the process' and left.

I again made a call to amazon customer service and the guy on the line said 'sir, you are our prime member, we'll have it sorted in 24 hrs' and again arranged the pickup + delivery.

Again the loop started, the delivery guy wanted the IMEI number on dead tablet and without that he wouldn't process the delivery of new tablet.
I was stuck in this paradox of showing IMEI number of the dead device by going to about section of device which needs it to get powered up first (that the tab obviously can't)

But this delivery guy was considerate enough, he said, let's try putting it on charge and even if I get pic of that 'about device' menu that shows the IMEI number, I'll process the return right away. My luck struck the right chord over there and i was able to switch the tablet on in the Nth attempt (10+ attempts were made to charge the device but it would just vibrate once and then proceed to blackout) it started and with 1% battery indicating in the corner i got the IMEI number on the screen from the device setting and the delivery guy took picture of it and then the tablet died.

I got the new tablet as replacement and it's working good.

So who's at fault here for this headache? Amazon customer service said that the tablet will be replaced just with certificate, delivery team was more interested in starting the dead tablet to verify the IMEI number... So I guess it's the communication between the amazon and it's delivery team.; Good product as expected; The tablets display is good. Average performance. Camera gets the work done with 10x zoom doing average. Memory is okay for multitasking. It is indeed the best for its price.; All functions are as expected. P99 processor at affordable price.; Convenient to use; After 10 days of usage the tab is restarting on its own. Now ai have to go to the service center which is 50kms away. Now I am doubting the products sild by Amazon.; J'adore cette tablette pas trop grosse juste parfaite je peux faire plusieurs choses en même temps plusieurs applications ouverte et aucun bogue.La caméra n'est pas fameuse mais bon On peut relié nos appels et messages textes de notre téléphone dessus. Le son est bon n'as pas de stylet par contre. Il se peut que vous ne réussissez pas à mettre Canada comme pays choisissez l'Australie et français ça ne change rien. Je suis surprise de sa rapidité et l'autonomie de batterie Samsung offre vraiment de la qualité à bon prix.; What I like..........Nice size, span a grip with one hand, easy carry. It will fly a DJI mini 2 drone. It will connect to an external HD. It does have an SD card slot and SIM card slot. And it has a real Samsung processor. Not many do. The only thing I noticed, it's not powerful enough to run Video editing software. But plays videos no problem.; Pros: Fast & smooth operation.

Cons: Texts appear blurry; eye protection mode doesn't work as intended; screen fails to register my touch 20% of the time.

Returned.; Replaced my Ipay 50 mini, which was starting to warp. This Samsung is a brand name you can't go wrong with. Built solid and lots of support to go with it.; acheter pour mon épouse qui a quelques problemes avec ses mains . donc elle est facile pour elle de la manipuler ,"

This is one of the best under 20k.
because the tab at 9 inch is so convenient.
clear good screen.
amazingly loud and crisp sound. you get good bass as well.
I have a Lenovo P11 gen 2 and Realme Pad 2 as well at home.
this one is definitely better in terms of sound output. both volume and quality.

has 3.5mm Jack.
good camera for video call or text scanning.
very light. ideal for reading and casual office work and video.
flawless connectivity - LTE and WiFi both.
I would have bought this even at 15k.
its excellent value for money at 12.5k; Lenovo Tab is good in every aspect. Thank you Amazon.; Very lightweight at 344gm. Good speed for such a low cost tab. I bought 4gb/64gb version which comes with TPU stand in the factory box itself. Also had protection glass free and charger also. Very convenient. Good battery life. Sound quality is very good.; ; I liked the 9 inch size of this tablet, not too big nor too small. Also this colour Frost blue looks awesome.
Tablet performance is very nice.Didnt see any lags whatsoever with my initial 2 days usage now.
The clearcase backcover along with the stand and the tempered glass also coming with the package is an added advantage.
Display is very good and sound is also nice and loud. Battery also lasts long as far as I used.
Overall a decent performance tablet in perfect size.; tablet restarting again and again mic also stopped working had to restart then it work. getting stuck restart on its own and then work . worst experience need to return it; Battery drains out fast; I havent used it continuously for long hours but still I would say the battery is really very good. I mainly bought it for watching movies and it does that job pretty well.

But sometimes when I scroll through, the animations of the GUI felt laggy. I think the processor is not that capable to manage heavy applications. As I dont use if for gaming I am not considering it as a drawback.

And I think they have put the right price tag for the product"

The build quality is a testament to Nokia's commitment to durability. Even after two years of sporadic use, the tablet feels just as robust and well-constructed as it did on day one. There are no signs of wear and tear, and the device still feels new and reliable.

Performance-wise, the Nokia T20 Tab has maintained its speed and responsiveness. It handles multitasking effortlessly, allowing me to switch between apps without any lag or slowdown. The battery life remains commendable, holding a charge for extended periods, which is crucial for long work or entertainment sessions.

The software updates provided by Nokia have ensured that the tablet stays current and secure. The user interface remains intuitive and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience even with advancements in software and applications over time.

Moreover, the sound quality continues to impress, whether I'm using headphones or the tablet's speakers. The audio output remains clear and well-balanced, enhancing the overall multimedia experience.

In summary, while my personal usage of the Nokia T20 Tab might be less extensive, its ability to retain its quality, performance, and durability after two years speaks volumes. It's a testament to Nokia's commitment to delivering a reliable, long-lasting, and high-performing tablet.

Pros:

Impressive and immersive 10.36-inch display
Outstanding build quality and durability
Consistent performance with minimal lag
Reliable battery life for extended use
Timely software updates for security and functionality
Excellent audio quality for an enhanced multimedia experience
Cons:

Limited personal usage prevents an in-depth review of long-term performance across various scenarios; I bought this tablet without a sim. This works fine and I would strongly recommend it. Easy to use, has fairly long battery.

Only issue, rather irritant, is that while watching movies, YouTube stops intermittently and the screen switches off. Screen has to be restarted.

Other than this, it's been good to use the tablet.; I’ve bought this tab for my son’s online classes. And I must say it is a good budget tablet from Nokia for educational purposes. The quality of the display is great. Low blue light is also very good for child's eyes during the classes. You will have a great experience while consuming online media (YouTube, etc). For online classes and for other casual usages, it is really good. All other specs seem to be good for this price tag from Nokia. The audio quality is really good, build quality is excellent.; The tablet screen just stopped working, No touch response either and half screen is dead. This is the 2nd major issued on this tablet within 14 months of buying.
First time over-the-air software upgrade happened automatically which sent the tablet into dead mode.
Second issue is this screen fault, no physical damage or accidental drop and still the screen stopped working. The repair cost for screen is INR 8500+taxes because the parts are priced higher by NOKIA.
Why would I spend another 9000+ for a screen replacement when there is no warranty on repairs quality either. Bought a new Lenovo tablet for 9300...
Absolutely bad product with very poor quality.; ; "

Am very much annoyed with this purchase, I bought this during Jan 2023 (6GB-128GB), within 10days the issue started.
This tablet is a good model only, however it has got an issue with its auto screen-locking, it will not allow you to use this table for even few minutes. I am tired of unlocking it, and sometimes it will lock while inputting the screen patter / password.
I tried my best to tweak it myself but not successful. And I was really surprised to see lot of users have posted about this issue in the Lenovo Forum, and the disappointing factor is that - it is not yet fixed even by the Lenovo support, they are simply giving some blah blah steps, change settings, check the lock button, reset factory settings etc, but there is no such update this issue has an solution.

Single star is given only due to the Locking Issue, and apart from this issue, this Tablet is a good device.

Pros:
1. Fast Charging.
2. Crystal Clear Display.
3. No Lagging.
4. Good Audio Quality.
5. Smooth Transition.
6. Good Battery Backup.
7. No Heating Issues.
8. Supports USB Audio Out.
9. Supports Stylus.
10. Fast Streaming (OTT Applications).

Cons:
1. AUTO SCREEN LOCKING within Few Seconds, cant use it for even less than a Minute.
2. Poor Camera Quality - both Front and Rear.

Thank You.

Due to the frequent screen locking issues I visited the Lenevo Exclusive Service Centre. The Executive Mr. Parthiban without even opening the Tablet resolved the issue.
The Problem is not with this device, but with the Tablet Case with the Magnetic Lock. The Tab frequently locked due to the Magnetic Interference with the Sensor.
Now it's not locking by itself as I am using the Tab Case without bringing the Magnetic Lock into that Sensor.

Regarding the Camera clarity I got to know the in-app camera quality is average but if the camera is used as a stand alone then it's clarity is awesome.

This is a wonderful device and would recommend.

Thank You.; Very nice..I am using since last 1 year; Though not too fast , but moderate use is ok ok.
Does my work better and simplify.
Comfortable and portable device.
Network connectivity with LTE SIM & wifi are excellent 👌.
Justifies it's price .
Never let you regret for every penny.
Value for money 💰.
Definitely go for it. Recommended.; I bought the tablet through Amazon on 03 June 2024. It stopped working on 07 June within four days and now I have to run around to find service center. Worst Service of Amazon.; I still have it after 1 year; So far so good.; I will recommend Xiaomi or Samsung tabs; Nice product. Very effectively priced"

10/10 product which is particularly excellent for daily use!; I wanted an Android table for my work. After considering other tablet PC brands, I settled on this. They are an Indian brand with products manufactured in India. Quality is superb and it is value for money.; Value for money; I bought this DOMO Tablet for my younger brother for his studies, and he is very very happy with it, thanks DOMO.; The screen quality is good. I use it mostly for learning and entertainment and believe me no complaints so far.
I impressed with battery perforrmace as well as device performance.; Very nice one and good configuration, just ordered another cover for this and looking so elegant and performance is very good.; "

Overall good tablet.; Good for note taking, doddling with the pen .... does everything like daily activities YouTube, pdf reading, news,..Not a gamer so don't know anything about gaming experience. but it is definitely a good choice for students in budget.; Good product for every day usage.

Hardware and Software both are working fine. No hanging or heating problem. Screen quality is very good. Battery back is decent.
Look and feel is also very good and premium.; Got this tablet for 2 main reasons – Pen and the 4G connectivity. The tablet is good at the price, comes with good ram and storage support also
The pen works fine on the tablet and the free Nebo app is great for taking notes or converting handwriting into text to share etc.; Pros –
Good Screen Quality and Refresh Rate. The brightness also is good and color quality is great
Looks great and I love the colour
Latest Android 13 and they are promising upgrade to newer versions also (so support will be there for Android 15 also)
Wifi Connectivity is good
Good 8 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM

Cons –
Battery is only 7040 watts, can be more because you need more backup while travelling
Camera clarity not very good but it is okay for Video calls
Need to buy Pen separately.; Have been using this Tablet for a few days now.
Pros
1) Pen Available with the Tablet
2) Good Screen Size and Refresh Rate. No lag while keeping multiple apps open
3) Wifi & 4G Connectivity is good, did not face any connectivity issues
4) Screen size is perfect and display is nice

Cons
1) Pen does not magnetically attach to the Tablet. So you have to buy a tablet case or keep the pen separately.
2) Pen does not have USB Charging but works on AAAA battery; As a student, this tablet has become my go-to study companion. It comes bundled with a Pen which is of great help in taking short notes or editing documents. The battery life is impressive, lasting an entire day without needing a recharge. I also wanted something with 4G Connectivity and am glad that this Tablet comes with it."

I hope you get the idea from it go for higher it will be more better than this and; This review is not for product but the delivery and return process of amazon. Ordered this tablet and found out that this one is not charging at all, so called the amazon customer support and they said 'no worries, get a diagnostic report from samsung service centre and with that certificate, return the product'. So i went to samsung care and the guys over there helped getting me the diagnostic report certificate named ""dead on arrival"" (DOA).

Now, i called the amazon customer support and they arranged pickup for return of tablet (with DOA certificate) and delivery of new tablet. And here comes the paradox... (Remember why i was returning the tablet? It wasn't charging, and so it was literally dead on battery)
The delivery guy says he needs to see the IMEI number on the device in the 'about device' menu on the battery dead tablet, i said it is impossible since the tablet won't start. He said 'then I can not complete the process' and left.

I again made a call to amazon customer service and the guy on the line said 'sir, you are our prime member, we'll have it sorted in 24 hrs' and again arranged the pickup + delivery.

Again the loop started, the delivery guy wanted the IMEI number on dead tablet and without that he wouldn't process the delivery of new tablet.
I was stuck in this paradox of showing IMEI number of the dead device by going to about section of device which needs it to get powered up first (that the tab obviously can't)

But this delivery guy was considerate enough, he said, let's try putting it on charge and even if I get pic of that 'about device' menu that shows the IMEI number, I'll process the return right away. My luck struck the right chord over there and i was able to switch the tablet on in the Nth attempt (10+ attempts were made to charge the device but it would just vibrate once and then proceed to blackout) it started and with 1% battery indicating in the corner i got the IMEI number on the screen from the device setting and the delivery guy took picture of it and then the tablet died.

I got the new tablet as replacement and it's working good.

So who's at fault here for this headache? Amazon customer service said that the tablet will be replaced just with certificate, delivery team was more interested in starting the dead tablet to verify the IMEI number... So I guess it's the communication between the amazon and it's delivery team.; Good product as expected; The tablets display is good. Average performance. Camera gets the work done with 10x zoom doing average. Memory is okay for multitasking. It is indeed the best for its price.; All functions are as expected. P99 processor at affordable price.; Convenient to use; After 10 days of usage the tab is restarting on its own. Now ai have to go to the service center which is 50kms away. Now I am doubting the products sild by Amazon.; J'adore cette tablette pas trop grosse juste parfaite je peux faire plusieurs choses en même temps plusieurs applications ouverte et aucun bogue.La caméra n'est pas fameuse mais bon On peut relié nos appels et messages textes de notre téléphone dessus. Le son est bon n'as pas de stylet par contre. Il se peut que vous ne réussissez pas à mettre Canada comme pays choisissez l'Australie et français ça ne change rien. Je suis surprise de sa rapidité et l'autonomie de batterie Samsung offre vraiment de la qualité à bon prix.; What I like..........Nice size, span a grip with one hand, easy carry. It will fly a DJI mini 2 drone. It will connect to an external HD. It does have an SD card slot and SIM card slot. And it has a real Samsung processor. Not many do. The only thing I noticed, it's not powerful enough to run Video editing software. But plays videos no problem.; Pros: Fast & smooth operation.

Cons: Texts appear blurry; eye protection mode doesn't work as intended; screen fails to register my touch 20% of the time.

Returned.; Replaced my Ipay 50 mini, which was starting to warp. This Samsung is a brand name you can't go wrong with. Built solid and lots of support to go with it.; acheter pour mon épouse qui a quelques problemes avec ses mains . donc elle est facile pour elle de la manipuler ,"

This is a very good model with 8 GB Ram and 128 GB Memory. It also has extra microSD card supporting 1 TB storage.
The 11 Inch screen is also good and I don’t find any glare issues. I have played some games also on it and it is working okay. Don’t expect very high graphics will work.
Overall good tablet.; Good for note taking, doddling with the pen .... does everything like daily activities YouTube, pdf reading, news,..Not a gamer so don't know anything about gaming experience. but it is definitely a good choice for students in budget.; Good product for every day usage. Nice big screen at 11 Inch and good refresh rate, did not feel any lag also while using the app. The battery is also decent and I am able to use it for a day atleast at full charge!; Very impressive product, working very smoothly. Hardware and Software both are working fine. No hanging or heating problem. Screen quality is very good. Battery back is decent.
Look and feel is also very good and premium.; Got this tablet for 2 main reasons – Pen and the 4G connectivity. The tablet is good at the price, comes with good ram and storage support also
The pen works fine on the tablet and the free Nebo app is great for taking notes or converting handwriting into text to share etc.; Pros –
Good Screen Quality and Refresh Rate. The brightness also is good and color quality is great
Looks great and I love the colour
Latest Android 13 and they are promising upgrade to newer versions also (so support will be there for Android 15 also)
Wifi Connectivity is good
Good 8 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM

Cons –
Battery is only 7040 watts, can be more because you need more backup while travelling
Camera clarity not very good but it is okay for Video calls
Need to buy Pen separately.; Have been using this Tablet for a few days now.
Pros
1) Pen Available with the Tablet
2) Good Screen Size and Refresh Rate. No lag while keeping multiple apps open
3) Wifi & 4G Connectivity is good, did not face any connectivity issues
4) Screen size is perfect and display is nice

Cons
1) Pen does not magnetically attach to the Tablet. So you have to buy a tablet case or keep the pen separately.
2) Pen does not have USB Charging but works on AAAA battery; As a student, this tablet has become my go-to study companion. It comes bundled with a Pen which is of great help in taking short notes or editing documents. The battery life is impressive, lasting an entire day without needing a recharge. I also wanted something with 4G Connectivity and am glad that this Tablet comes with it."

If anyone finding a affordable tab for something to read and watch videos, definitely go for it.. and memory is expandable..

Attached sim/sd card eject tool is useless it doesn't open the tray..find a good eject tool to push and pop out the tray.. overall experience is good and I bought it in 9k..; I have experienced lag and there i a small dent which is not noticeable, rest everything is okay; Writing this review after 6 months of extensive uses :-

Overall- 9/10; The sd card tray can't open. Some time lagging the tab.; This tablet Has all the features one would require, it runs very smoothly the size is perfect for daily... I would suggest anyone who has low budget To go for realme pad mini; Serves it's purpose well. Battery is also good. Better product in this price category.
Good quality in this price range. Go for it.; Display is not working and it got blurred fully within a year.; I won’t beat around the bush and tell you that this is the best bang for the buck or anything but if you are in a tight budget like me just go for it also don’t hope it to heavy duty task like opening multiple tabs on chrome like me. I am a avid manga reader so i just keep the tabs open and sometimes it take some times to load them.
Screen is good but i wished it to be brighter.
Body is good but still weak I accidentally dropped it from the height ht of my bike and it seriously got dented on one side, so buy a cover with it and don’t go daredevil like me"

Battery drain only 35% even after continuously 3-4 hours online video classes...
Overall Good Product in this Price Segment...
For online classes up to 12th standard...very good Product...; This is by far the best budget android tablet. The tab itself is slow when compared to an iPad but way faster and has a better UI when compared to other tablets at its price. The usb c port is priceless if you use lot of accessories like flash drives. The Samsung One UI is the best android version out there for tablets. Screen quality is just as you’d expect from Samsung. Great for a secondary tablet. Highly recommended if on a budget.; Always believed in Samsung after Nokia discontinued its mobile production and always hated Chinese product.
So the point is Samsung never disappointed me if you are a S series user. To my surprise Samung Tab A being a budget tablets range works really cool.
Bettery, Screen, Performance (for regular use including games like asphalt), user friendly. Overall good package.; Very nice product. Excellent full hd display,
loud and clear sound, long lasting battery
having fast type C charging . The touch screen
works smoothly . Overall a good product by
Samsung . Value for money.; Price a bit high than others but quality wise no comparison..one of the best tablet..using for kids study..can buy without any hesitation..screen is large enough..; Poor build, screen came apart within 1 week; It can only be used to watch videos n some other casual stuff, not useful for work purposes. It has a very laggy software, pooer battery life and takes too much time to charge as well. Not a product worth investing; Honestly speaking this is a not a product I will buy for my day to day work. I bought this product for my dad who is more interested in being social and connected on the go. So from that perspective with 4G connectivity this tab was pretty reasonable. One more up side was the design. The body is slim and has a good screen size. The batterh runs descent (6 hours minimum browsing/streaming) if you turn off not required Samsung apps.
But for even slightly above average users this is not a tab you will like to use as the lag in switching apps and opening apps is good enough to make you understand that."

Display; All of it is perfect...not for heavy gaming; This tablet is only for Arabic regions! My Country/region Is not in it. I will return this tablet and get one that has country choices..... I AM CHANGING MY REVIEW! I FIGURED IT OUT!
I was about to return it when I decided to give it another try! Luckily,
I was able to set it up easily! This tablet is wonderful! Clear picture, very thin and light weight. I am very happy with this tablet and I recommend it. 5 ✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️; Cette tablette ne fonctionne pas au Canada. J’ai parlé à un technicien de Samsung qui m’a dit de contacter Amazon. Incapable de parler à quelqu’un chez Amazon!; Very Happy With It; If you're looking to play casually. Sure. But if you're looking to play professionally or top-tier. Nope. It runs the game just fine, but the screen jitters when you move your camera. It makes precise aiming incredibly impossible sometimes the swiping is fast and sometimes it's slow, it has to do with how the screen registers where your finger is.

And if you play with a six-finger cloth or so many fingers on the screen that this doesn't even know how to sense your fingers.

If you're only looking for performance then this is good, but if you're looking to improve and accurately shoot at people, I can't recommend this.

My previous device was the Apple iPad Pro 2020 11-in and I played professionally on that.

The screen jitteriness on this one makes it almost impossible to be consistently accurate when shooting at people.; Purchased for my wife and she loves everything about it. Nice clear display, great sound quality, and quite a snappy performer. We have had several android tablets but always go back to Samsung. Connects easily to the internet and mobile hotspot from her phone so she can watch her tv shows anywhere. She is very happy and so am I, very happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone."

I am using pad 2 since 1 month. Pad working nice. Sound quality is good . Amazing touch response. Battery life is more than 2 days. Full charged in 2 hours.

The Battery is slightly heavy which makes it difficult to hold Tablet in the Hands for a long time but as it is more than 8000mah battery ,the battery lasts for very long .Almost 3 to 4 Days without charging on normal use which is very very good.
Thank you Realme for the Wonderful and Very useful Tablet .Also Thank you to Amazon for the Fast and careful delivery
👍👍👍👍; Sound, display all are great.. good to buy..; I was planning to donate tablets to Government Schools in Karnataka and hence bought this product just to test the performance before finalising the brand/make of tablets. After using it for 2 days I am keeping this trial piece for myself and will buy more tablets for donation to Govt schools. I bought this product since it has both Wi-fi+4G. In villages wifi availability is poor but 4G SIM will help due to better Jio network. In some videos it is shown that earphone cannot be plugged into this product. But with the help of a small cable it is possible, as with many new smartphones these days.; Battery and processor very good.; This is absolutely not worth it … it is taking forever to charge and sometimes it doesnt even charge the charger that the give with this is very poorly made it only goes 70% of the way in … there are also other things like the ui and the performance they are okayish for the price not something to be praised of … about build quality its alright its not bad but i wouldnt say its good as for the camera its not good i mean they gave a module for 2 lenses and theres only one other one is empty i suggest buy some other tablet because this is not value for ur money; Good screen and great sound. Watch movies on this tablet. Battery capacity is nice too.; After one week usage every thing good and nice product from Realme"

I honestly liked this very much, it's just outstanding and I am in love with it.

Pros :- Display, Sound, Battery, UI, smooth functioning.

Cons :- When you have more than 5 apps running in background, it may lag or hang. You might not be able to play high performance games or use multiple apps back to back.

Overall, I'd say it's a 10/10, hope it continues to be a fantastic product.; The Xiaomi Pad 6 stands out as a high-performance tablet offering exceptional value for money. Its sleek design and solid build quality give it a premium feel, while the 11-inch 2.5K display is stunning, with vibrant colors and a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. This makes it perfect for watching movies, playing games, or reading.

Performance is a key highlight, thanks to the Snapdragon 870 processor. The tablet runs smoothly, whether you’re multitasking, gaming, or using intensive apps. The 8840mAh battery ensures you can use the device for extended periods without worrying about running out of power, and the fast charging support means you can quickly top it up.

The camera setup, while not groundbreaking, is sufficient for video calls and casual photography. The quad speakers offer a surprisingly good audio experience, adding to the multimedia appeal of the device.

With optional accessories like a keyboard and stylus, the Xiaomi Pad 6 can also serve as a productivity tool, making it suitable for students and professionals alike. The MIUI for Pad interface is intuitive and adds to the overall smooth user experience.

In summary, the Xiaomi Pad 6 delivers exceptional performance, a brilliant display, and great battery life, all at a competitive price point, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking for a versatile and affordable tablet.; ; Had an old ipad.

I am not a gamer (my gaming runs to a round of Sudoku, and that too when I get the time for it). I do not have much use for a precision stylus or so. My main uses involve reading PDF files; writing; and occasionally watching a Youtube video. So I needed a tab that was lightweight, reasonably fast, with a good screen, good storage capabilities and, most crucially, long battery life. I am happy to say this tab more than checks all my boxes.

The screen resolution is excellent, more than adequate for my purposes. I prefer IPS screens to OLED; they tend to consume less battery while still yielding a decent viewing experience. The 120Hz refresh rate makes for smooth scrolling when viewing high-resolution image-based PDFs. So far the battery life has proved excellent. I tend to charge it about once in three to four days. For some reason the Amazon page does not specify SD cards of what capacity can be used. Other sites say it supports 1TB cards, which is more than ample for me (NB: I've not bought a card for it so far). The tab is also lightweight; it causes minimal discomfort even when I hold it in my hands and read or view videos in bed for extended periods. Lenovo's productivity mode deserves to be commended. Used in conjunction with opensource software like Collabora Office, it offers a decent work environment, which is all the more notable because Android was created keeping altogether different purposes in mind. But even without productivity mode, the Mac-style taskbar delivers a decent if limited office experience.

UPDATE: THE P11 (2ND GEN) DOES HAVE A 3.5 MM HEADPHONE JACK!! DO NOT BE MISLED BY ERRONEOUS REVIEWS. For some reason Amazon's listed the P11 (2nd gen) and the older P11 Plus on the same page. The P11 Plus does not have a headphone jack. And the reviews and answers to questions that say there's no headphone jack were all written with the P11 Plus in mind. I REPEAT, THE P11 (2ND GEN) HAS A 3.5 MM HEADPHONE JACK, AND IT WORKS JUST FINE!!

I have some grouses, though:

1. Some apps don't function well in productivity mode.
2. Why aren't official Lenovo keyboards, or even third-party keyboards, available anywhere on Amazon or the Lenovo India website?

These shortcomings are not dealbreakers (I'm sure I'll be able to buy keyboards sooner than later). All in all, a very satisfactory deal, excellent value for money if you're not looking for high-octane gaming.; Good product but quite heavy for daily use.; ; I ignored the reviews mentioning about the problem with wifi turning off automatically very often, but it is real and very annoying to dismiss the wifi popup every few minutes once.
It's a manufacturing defect so don't go for this !odel. It's going to be defective.; The Lenovo P11 plus tab is a decent device for daily reading, entertainment or even office work (in productive mode and with an external keyboard and mouse).
The build quality although is not refined as the iPads (which I have been using since past 10 years) but then no one gets to lay their hands on a good tablet at this price point. I was somewhat circumspect about the buying choice given that I have never used an android device before. I just bought it off a whim and also the fact that it would give me an experience with an android device. So far I am happy with it.

The battery life is decent and lasts almost the whole day of continuous use. Touch screen is responsive and the best part is that Lenovo P11 plus does not have any junk applications and bloat ware. The interface is intuitive and it took me just a couple of hours of playing with it to get familiar. The chipset is also decent although it’s not the best there could but so would be the associated price.
It’s a tablet that is suitable for everyone and for everyday use - students, casual mobile gamers, office goers.
Surprisingly after connecting to my apple keyboard and mouse, I have not used my laptop since I bought this tablet.
Primarily I bought it to allow me to read my vast collection of eBooks and as an aid for online study.

I would even recommend the Lenovo precision 2 stylus pen for this tab although it’s currently out of stock at most retailers. (I bought it from an official Lenovo supplier separately and am so happy with it.)
Overall a decent Tablet which i would recommend for anyone who needs an affordable device for their basic needs.; ; Pros:
1. Affordable range
2. Good for simple gaming
3. Good for browsing
4. Compatible with Lenovo Precision Pen 2
5. Thin bazzels and premium built
6. 2K display
7. Good for office use with productivity mode.

Cons:
1. Poor Camera quality at this price range
2. No fingerprint sensor iPad 9th gen has it at this price range
3. No headphone jack again iPad 9th gen has it
4. Social medias are not programmed for tablet usage

The product has its ups and downs but overall one can easily find its usage in everyday tasks.

After 6months of usage I find this product quite useful in all my work. It is light weight so easily can be carried around. Great for binge-watching content online. Unfortunately though without any headphone jack you are forced to use Bluetooth devices for having any conversation otherwise in case your blue device runs out of battery it would be in loudspeaker.; All features are well 🙂"

The 11 Inch screen is also good and I don’t find any glare issues. I have played some games also on it and it is working okay. Don’t expect very high graphics will work.
Overall good tablet.; Good for note taking, doddling with the pen .... does everything like daily activities YouTube, pdf reading, news,..Not a gamer so don't know anything about gaming experience. but it is definitely a good choice for students in budget.; Good product for every day usage. Nice big screen at 11 Inch and good refresh rate, did not feel any lag also while using the app. The battery is also decent and I am able to use it for a day atleast at full charge!; Very impressive product, working very smoothly. Hardware and Software both are working fine. No hanging or heating problem. Screen quality is very good. Battery back is decent.
Look and feel is also very good and premium.; Got this tablet for 2 main reasons – Pen and the 4G connectivity. The tablet is good at the price, comes with good ram and storage support also
The pen works fine on the tablet and the free Nebo app is great for taking notes or converting handwriting into text to share etc.; Pros –
Good Screen Quality and Refresh Rate. The brightness also is good and color quality is great
Looks great and I love the colour
Latest Android 13 and they are promising upgrade to newer versions also (so support will be there for Android 15 also)
Wifi Connectivity is good
Good 8 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM

Cons –
Battery is only 7040 watts, can be more because you need more backup while travelling
Camera clarity not very good but it is okay for Video calls
Need to buy Pen separately.; Have been using this Tablet for a few days now.
Pros
1) Pen Available with the Tablet
2) Good Screen Size and Refresh Rate. No lag while keeping multiple apps open
3) Wifi & 4G Connectivity is good, did not face any connectivity issues
4) Screen size is perfect and display is nice

Cons
1) Pen does not magnetically attach to the Tablet. So you have to buy a tablet case or keep the pen separately.
2) Pen does not have USB Charging but works on AAAA battery; As a student, this tablet has become my go-to study companion. It comes bundled with a Pen which is of great help in taking short notes or editing documents. The battery life is impressive, lasting an entire day without needing a recharge. I also wanted something with 4G Connectivity and am glad that this Tablet comes with it."

I was about to return it when I decided to give it another try! Luckily,
I was able to set it up easily! This tablet is wonderful! Clear picture, very thin and light weight. I am very happy with this tablet and I recommend it. 5 ✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️; Cette tablette ne fonctionne pas au Canada. J’ai parlé à un technicien de Samsung qui m’a dit de contacter Amazon. Incapable de parler à quelqu’un chez Amazon!; Very Happy With It; If you're looking to play casually. Sure. But if you're looking to play professionally or top-tier. Nope. It runs the game just fine, but the screen jitters when you move your camera. It makes precise aiming incredibly impossible sometimes the swiping is fast and sometimes it's slow, it has to do with how the screen registers where your finger is.

And if you play with a six-finger cloth or so many fingers on the screen that this doesn't even know how to sense your fingers.

If you're only looking for performance then this is good, but if you're looking to improve and accurately shoot at people, I can't recommend this.

My previous device was the Apple iPad Pro 2020 11-in and I played professionally on that.

The screen jitteriness on this one makes it almost impossible to be consistently accurate when shooting at people.; Purchased for my wife and she loves everything about it. Nice clear display, great sound quality, and quite a snappy performer. We have had several android tablets but always go back to Samsung. Connects easily to the internet and mobile hotspot from her phone so she can watch her tv shows anywhere. She is very happy and so am I, very happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone."

It feels much more expensive than it is - slim design and stylish looks. But the best part is how well it runs. Apps open fast and everything feels smooth, even when I jump between a bunch of things at once. The battery life is also fantastic - I've been using it for hours on a single charge. Overall, I'm super happy with my purchase. If you're looking for a new tablet, I'd definitely recommend checking this one out.; The Redmi Pad SE is awesome for kicking back and enjoying entertainment. The 11-inch display is super smooth thanks to the 90Hz refresh rate, making everything from movies to games a joy to experience. Plus, the battery lasts for ages, so you can binge-watch worry-free.

The build quality is surprisingly good too - feels really sturdy and secure in your hands. Overall, if you're looking for a big-screen tablet for everyday fun at a great price, the Redmi Pad SE is a great choice!; Nice UX, good screen, good battery, 90hz display is amazing, speakers are above average. Aesthetic form factor. Snapdragon processor. 128gb storage that’s also expandable.
All this for 12k? Il take that.; Firstly, wrong TAB delivered to us (instead of 8 GB - 128 GB, they delivered 6 GB - 128 GB) and moreover, no support from Amazon have to file a consumer case for this.

TAB is real disappointment

It hangs a lot and screen brightness is real issue.

Don't even think of buying this unless you just want to waste your money.; I am writting this review almost after a month of usage of this tablet. I am personally very happy with the product and overall features. Worth to buy with this price for such great performance tablet.; This is a very nice tablet.. Working very smoothly.. Hardware and software both are working fine.. No heating problem.. No hanging.. Viewing experience is very good.. Battery backup is good.. Finish and looks are premium..; Don't expect more with it .. Average product. It is good for browsing and multimedia. Display is good, battery backup could better. Sometimes it will get hang if you use multiple applications.overall it is a average tab. But does its job well.; My best decision to go for the purchase. Display and sound are the highlights for the product with user friendly and smooth UI experience. Overall, great buy at this price point. Definitely recommend to go for this."

As I have never used honor product nor anyone I know has any honor product.
But from last almost a year i used to see this product on sale @ 18999 6gb ram 128gb storage with 12 inch screen this is what attracted from day 1. So I kept making up and then changing my mind.
Lastly bought this month on sale Aug 2023.
1st attractive thing is huge display at this price there is no 12ich tablet display available lesser than 45k (32-35 k during sale) and that's Samsung s7 fe tab , if u have that kind of money to spare go with Samsung s7 fe during sale of BBD its sold 32k it's better tablet. But if you don't wanna spare that much like me, then blindly go with Honor pad 8 for huge immersive display.
2nd attractive thing is 6gb ram , due to which there is no lag it's very smooth experience I get everytime I have used.
3rd attractive thing is the gaming experience, I have installed games like Dead target, Alto Odyssey, shadow fight4 ,asaphalt 8 and 9, WCC2, Fifa mobile, bowling crew, Subway surfer , tennis open 23 and temple run 2. Due to the big and smooth screen I enjoyed all the games like I have never enjoyed before.
4th attractive thing is the speaker sound of this tablet, it's amazing sound like I have never heard before on any portable device like phone tablet laptop. U won't need an external speaker and it's a surround sounding speaker.
5th attractive thing is it's a very good looking tablet, as it's huge and very thin/slim. Looks very nice 👍
6th attractive thing is 128 GB storage, I have counted , I have downloaded 36 app from Play Store after I bought this tab and it's excluding pre installed apps. Now it shows 31.73 Gb used of 128GB. Which mean after downloading 36 apps that includes OTT apps , social media apps, browser and games , I still have 96.27 GB left .
6th attractive thing is the battery, I have used this tablet 3-4 hrs a day .. and I charge it every 3rd day. I am charging this with a 10 watt charger which I had extra it takes an hour long than 22.5 watt. But battery drains very slowly when I charge with a 10 watt charger.

Camera is of no use for me in a tablet so I don't care. If someone wanna buy a tab for camera due to some reason then don't buy this . This tab has Almost an unusable camera in 2023

The only con for me in this tablet is that the 12 inch display has potential to play in good quality videos. Like on Netflix , Prime video, disney plus Hotstar, jio cinema videos looks amazing .
But on YouTube when I play songs they play at 1080 p but as the screen is big the quality of the video is not very clear.
Like I played chaleya from Jawan and that song was little hazy(little pixelated) , I think if YouTube videos could be played at 1440 p then it would look good on this 12inch tab, but as this has snapdragon 680, so it won't play at 1440p for any video, 1080p is the highest that this chipset can play. But don't get me wrong it's definitely watchable and some videos have that 1080p enhanced for YouTube premium users those videos look wonderful but as if now it's not available on all songs and videos

But at 18999 rs I cannot complain much
I wanted a 12 inch display tab so I got it .
And I am very happy with this tab
With amazing surround sound and butter smooth ui experience it feels a premium tab.
Note: if u buy this tablet then buy Robustrion tempered glass and back cover, not much options are available but I saw its sold by the same seller who sold this tab to me on Amazon- Appario so i ordered and it's little on the higher side on price like 699+799 , but it will go on for years cz of quality.; First of all, removed one Star as it doesn't have expandable memory slot and no charger (though mentioned clearly in product description)

Tablet is fast and responsive touch screen. Display is resonably good. The screen is large, which is ideal for my purpose. But due to large size and weight, may be difficult to carry around. Battery Backup is good.

Overall a good tablet, if 128 gb (available memory after all app installation is 80-90GB) storage is enough for you.; ; Best products for student👩‍🎓 💯💯💯👍; I bought this product for my son home study purpose. It is very nice quality in resolution and sound output. Its sound is very loud and clear.; After using it for month, more or less happy with it. Value for money, screen resolution is good, sound is not bad and over all good value for money, battery life is good but not the charging time. Some issues are, surprisingly few apps from play stores are not being supported with this device. Face ID recognition is not good at all. If the light is down a little, face recognition doesn’t work. Auto time zone detection is missing. Auto Rotation is not working all the time. Anyhow these are minor ones and hopefully they resolve them soon; These two are only two good things going for this tablet. 60hz screen, i don't mind it. The software comes without bloatware but it's bland and feature less. I would go as far as to say Xiaomi ui and software is better even if it's bloated. The applock is garbage, software support is also over i think and you can't put custom roms because it cannot be rooted. Now I don't root phones or tablets but I had to consider it after seeing the bland features and functionality honor was offering. Go for x9 instead of this or better go for xiaomi or redmi pads.; Thanks lot for such lowest price and best smart features.
So smooth hassle-free leg free performance..multi tasking etc all good"

1) Battery: Amazing. easily works for 2-3 days even on little heavy usage.
2) split screen feature is just amazing.
3) you will love watching movies on it due to dolby sound and its screen.

cons:
One plus used mobile OS on their tab and hence you will see some settings related to mobile on tablet as well.; Pros:

High quality LCD screen
Support for 4K
Dolby Atmos
Latest processor with enough RAM for multitasking

Cons:

No finger print authentication
One plus pencil not available
Case for the tablet is very limited

Cons are not dealbreaker. I am using it for more than one month and I did not face any issues. Hence, recommending the same to others without hesitation.; Hardware is top notch, display could be amoled but still quality of IPS is good.
No complaints on performance. Especially the speakers are just too good I compared it to iPad pro, yes there is a slight difference in bass but still oneplus competes with it. But it loses in terms of software it's not optimized for tablet also have some glitches, but as the update policy tells it will get 3+4 yrs updates hope oneplus fix this. You can definitely go for this tablet it's premium in looks and feeling but software makes it cheap. Heading forward for updates.; Good performance; This tab is good value for money. Runs Android but looks and feels like an iPad, the best of both worlds I would say. The display is brilliant, as is the sound quality. 3D/binaural tracks play back brilliantly. One drawback I have felt is that the tab is a bit heavier than one would expect.; Good Build. Everything Works Smoothly. Less Bloatware. Customisation is Better Than That Of Mi Pad. Overall Worth The Money.; Upgraded from s6lite display is worlds apart my oneplus phone connects to the pad I can get notification calls msg on pad and I can control phone from pad stylus is good but need more supporting apps and features like Samsung maybe in future updates battery is draining after 13.1 update overall good tablet; I was not sure about this tablet as for the price oneplus could have gone with SD8 plus gen 1 but Dimensity 9000 really surprised me the performance is very good on par with sd8 plus gen 1 and also gaming experience is very good no heating issues better than crappy display of ipad mini and standard ipads quality wise and also 144hz refresh rate is cherry on the top really satisfied; OnePlus Pad is a nice companion to my OnePlus 11 Pro, it's fast and included battery lasts days, charger charges super fast."

TLDR; Very good purchase at around 35-40k price. S pen built in is very helpful. Battery lasts long. Performance is very good.

Performance: SD 8 gen 1 is now an old flagship processor but it still has more than enough power to do any multitasking and gaming smoothly. 3 window concurrently is very helpful. The software experience is clean and fluid. Samsung utilities are amazing and handy. No lag or stutter or overheating observed in 4 months of usage

Battery: 8000 mAh is more than sufficient to last a few days with normal usage or video playback and games and productivity. Battery easily lasts 3-4 days for me. Charging with 20W PD charger takes 1.5 hours and is reasonably fast

Display: 11 inch display is perfect for being portable and big enough to be useful. Refresh rate of 120Hz makes the whole experience really smooth. Display is reasonably bright and colour reproduction is good for an LCD screen. Do note that this display is NOT HDR CAPABLE. So if that is a requirement, you need to look at S9 series or S8+.

Audio: Quad speaker setup and Dolby audio feature is amazing and very loud for its size. Reproduction is very nice.

S pen is the biggest USP for this tab and with OneUI 6 (Android 14) currently the whole experience is amazing and worth the price, i purchased for 36k in Oct 2023.; The Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 is truly remarkable for the price I got it for. I got it for 38000 (using SBI Credit Card) in the Great Indian Sale and it is the best sale deal I have got in a while.
The device packs a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and has a good battery of 8000mah. It can easily last a typical day of use. It also supports Samsung's 45W charger which charges it in an hour. Unfortunately it doesn't come with any charger in the box. But what comes in the box, the sPen is a god-like accessory, a perfect pair with the Tab S8. The sPen is just perfect, be it the low latency, the air gestures, pressure sensitivity and palm rejection, and it's quick charging and long battery.
It has a 8GB Ram paired with the 8 Gen 1 and there is no limits for this tablet for what it can do be it gaming or rendering 4K videos.
Samsung has created a perfect tablet system over its years of making Galaxy Tabs.
The front and rear cameras are good enough for a tablet and serves its purpose for videocalls and document scanning well. The tablet's body is made of Samsung's Armour Aluminium frame which is very classy and feels premium to say the least and enhances the tab's in-hand feel. The Quad Speakers tuned by AKG are on point and are perfect and makes watching videos and movies on a bigger screen extremely immersive. The tab has a side mounted fingerprint sensor which is quick and works well. Samsung's OneUI for tab is just another cherry on top which makes multitasking and animations seem effortless. The app support for sPen is just unreal. It comes with a 128GB storage which is sufficient but in case it might not be enough for some it even has an expandable storage upto 1TB! This can be a good laptop replacement for many users as Samsung DeX feels amazing on this device.
The only drawback that I feel is the TFT LCD display and it is sad that I won't be able to enjoy Samsung's Super Amoled. Even an IPS panel could have made it a little better. The screen is an 11"" 1600x2560 which feels perfect in size for simple tab usage and for carrying it everywhere and the resolution makes everything sharp. Also it is impossible to get the Official Tab S8 book cover, I purchased a Tab S7 book cover and it works indifferently.
But looking at the price to overall performance I would give the Tab S8 a solid 10/10 as Android Tablets below this price which can be considered are only Xiaomi Pad 5 (8GB RAM/SD860) for 29K and doesn't come with a Xiaomi Pen (extra 6000) even. And I got this for 38K with sPen in box.
I am overall extremely happy with what Samsung has made and will recommend this Tablet for anyone looking for an Android Tablet with medium budget and is looking for something which will compete with iPad 2021 models or iPad Minis.
Great job Samsung; Only con I m having is the display. I used s5e tab before this. The display of this s8 not matching with s5e. Having glare and unable to view dark background videos clearly.; Best of best one of best product and quality was superb and performance very good value for money and charging is so long lasting sound quality was superb; Tab S8 has a great display, an okay camera, a powerful processor that can handle all tasks and asks a very reasonable price for it. The Tab S9 series do not make it redundant. All the flagship samsung features are there, the processor is an year older than the SD Gen 2 but it handles anything i throw at it well- be it games like CoD or photo/video editing.; ; Giving it a 4 star ,cause although the game is smooth but it drops frames in between and heat ing is a major issue i had the buy a table fan specially for this also now it is of 50k when i bought it was 56k :( thats a RIP off haha and irony is the prices came when i got my tab and it was non refundble haha; Good battery life, sound quality is also good.."

This is one of the best under 20k.
because the tab at 9 inch is so convenient.
clear good screen.
amazingly loud and crisp sound. you get good bass as well.
I have a Lenovo P11 gen 2 and Realme Pad 2 as well at home.
this one is definitely better in terms of sound output. both volume and quality.

has 3.5mm Jack.
good camera for video call or text scanning.
very light. ideal for reading and casual office work and video.
flawless connectivity - LTE and WiFi both.
I would have bought this even at 15k.
its excellent value for money at 12.5k; Lenovo Tab is good in every aspect. Thank you Amazon.; Very lightweight at 344gm. Good speed for such a low cost tab. I bought 4gb/64gb version which comes with TPU stand in the factory box itself. Also had protection glass free and charger also. Very convenient. Good battery life. Sound quality is very good.; ; I liked the 9 inch size of this tablet, not too big nor too small. Also this colour Frost blue looks awesome.
Tablet performance is very nice.Didnt see any lags whatsoever with my initial 2 days usage now.
The clearcase backcover along with the stand and the tempered glass also coming with the package is an added advantage.
Display is very good and sound is also nice and loud. Battery also lasts long as far as I used.
Overall a decent performance tablet in perfect size.; tablet restarting again and again mic also stopped working had to restart then it work. getting stuck restart on its own and then work . worst experience need to return it; Battery drains out fast; I havent used it continuously for long hours but still I would say the battery is really very good. I mainly bought it for watching movies and it does that job pretty well.

But sometimes when I scroll through, the animations of the GUI felt laggy. I think the processor is not that capable to manage heavy applications. As I dont use if for gaming I am not considering it as a drawback.

And I think they have put the right price tag for the product"

Tried Called amazon customer care to return this product.; Got this tablet on 25 October, 2020. Return window closed on 7 November. From the first day, the tablet was showing the problem of ghost touch, which I assumed happens with new devices too sensitive and the user is still unfamiliar. Then it just kept hanging and getting stuck on several pages, not just slow functioning but totally freezing. The latest addition, can't take screenshots! I can handle my 2.25 year old tablet (Lenovo as well) showing these problems, but not this newly bought costlier model as well? What's the point of buying a new one then? And now I don't know what to do with it. It heats up as well.

PS I was really impressed with its sound and video call quality, but too little for too much. Android go maybe good for small mobiles but not on tablets probably.; Nice one quality ok"

Price is fair; The material used in this stand is very good. The only flaw is that this is a wire frame and the alignments of the pieces and the way it is bent into shape needs to be very precise. I find that there is a slight misalignment. But despite this it is quite stable. Overall I like the product. It is very good for use for my 7"" tablet in either portrait or landscape mode. I was hopeful that I would be able to use it for my 3"" mobile also but it slips through except in portrait position but even in this position it just about fits. But this is not a product issue - it is not designed for this. I feel this is very good for tablets; for mobiles please first compare the dimensions of your mobile against those given in the description - portrait position may most likely not be suitable except for large mobiles; Recently Purchased this. quality is top notch. Value Buy. 👍; ; Worst battery life, very slow response.
No return option and could not raise request for replacement also as there was no option to chose battery or performance issue. For replacement they have given options like damage, item missing etc only.
I bought it as it said Made in India. So you also don't get into that trap. It's worst tablet.; I am giving it 5 stars because it made my life easier as I prepare my assigments in Laptop and using ebooks so its better to use another device to use with laptop simultaneously but due to eyesight problem I cant see things clearly in mobile even after zooming so I use tab for better vision but it is not easy to handle due to its weight and size so this self adjusted stand came handy to me which gave me the freedom to use it in any desired angle, and it is best for tab and I use this to watch videos, also web surfing. It has very supportive metallic stand I recommend everyone to buy it. It will worth your every penny. And one last thing I made it to use in my mobile phone too😂; Loved the performance.; Feels premium. Suitable for iPad and tablets. Also you can use for phone to keep phone horizontally, not vertically. You have to fix the angle and tighten screw with screwdriver else your iPad will keep falling. The side knobs can't tighten because the screw inside keeps slipping."

Charger wire (USB C in both ends) is included, but no charger included. It should get 3-4 Android major version updates. LCD screen is perfectly fine. It's not cheap, but it's still good value for money.; The tab was working only for 2 hrs. Then it stopped working and never turned on. Black screen and nothing. Return was full of hassles. Annoying service and product from this seller. Don't order tabs from Amazon atleast not from this seller. Do it from Samsung site. Annoying and time waste!
Don't order electronic products from Amazon. These sellers give worst products. Use original Samsung or other site and order from their store. It has been a month since I returned this product and they have not still returned my money. I called they told they will tell after investigation and call after four days. Pathetic service by Amazon ever!!!; Same as above; All good only 1 con heating; Very gud shopping station I love that; I don't know what happened, there's not a single scratch on the outside. The display cracked from inside and this crazy lines... I just turned it on and this was there."

I hope you get the idea from it go for higher it will be more better than this and; This review is not for product but the delivery and return process of amazon. Ordered this tablet and found out that this one is not charging at all, so called the amazon customer support and they said 'no worries, get a diagnostic report from samsung service centre and with that certificate, return the product'. So i went to samsung care and the guys over there helped getting me the diagnostic report certificate named ""dead on arrival"" (DOA).

Now, i called the amazon customer support and they arranged pickup for return of tablet (with DOA certificate) and delivery of new tablet. And here comes the paradox... (Remember why i was returning the tablet? It wasn't charging, and so it was literally dead on battery)
The delivery guy says he needs to see the IMEI number on the device in the 'about device' menu on the battery dead tablet, i said it is impossible since the tablet won't start. He said 'then I can not complete the process' and left.

I again made a call to amazon customer service and the guy on the line said 'sir, you are our prime member, we'll have it sorted in 24 hrs' and again arranged the pickup + delivery.

Again the loop started, the delivery guy wanted the IMEI number on dead tablet and without that he wouldn't process the delivery of new tablet.
I was stuck in this paradox of showing IMEI number of the dead device by going to about section of device which needs it to get powered up first (that the tab obviously can't)

But this delivery guy was considerate enough, he said, let's try putting it on charge and even if I get pic of that 'about device' menu that shows the IMEI number, I'll process the return right away. My luck struck the right chord over there and i was able to switch the tablet on in the Nth attempt (10+ attempts were made to charge the device but it would just vibrate once and then proceed to blackout) it started and with 1% battery indicating in the corner i got the IMEI number on the screen from the device setting and the delivery guy took picture of it and then the tablet died.

I got the new tablet as replacement and it's working good.

So who's at fault here for this headache? Amazon customer service said that the tablet will be replaced just with certificate, delivery team was more interested in starting the dead tablet to verify the IMEI number... So I guess it's the communication between the amazon and it's delivery team.; Good product as expected; The tablets display is good. Average performance. Camera gets the work done with 10x zoom doing average. Memory is okay for multitasking. It is indeed the best for its price.; All functions are as expected. P99 processor at affordable price.; Convenient to use; After 10 days of usage the tab is restarting on its own. Now ai have to go to the service center which is 50kms away. Now I am doubting the products sild by Amazon.; J'adore cette tablette pas trop grosse juste parfaite je peux faire plusieurs choses en même temps plusieurs applications ouverte et aucun bogue.La caméra n'est pas fameuse mais bon On peut relié nos appels et messages textes de notre téléphone dessus. Le son est bon n'as pas de stylet par contre. Il se peut que vous ne réussissez pas à mettre Canada comme pays choisissez l'Australie et français ça ne change rien. Je suis surprise de sa rapidité et l'autonomie de batterie Samsung offre vraiment de la qualité à bon prix.; What I like..........Nice size, span a grip with one hand, easy carry. It will fly a DJI mini 2 drone. It will connect to an external HD. It does have an SD card slot and SIM card slot. And it has a real Samsung processor. Not many do. The only thing I noticed, it's not powerful enough to run Video editing software. But plays videos no problem.; Pros: Fast & smooth operation.

Cons: Texts appear blurry; eye protection mode doesn't work as intended; screen fails to register my touch 20% of the time.

Returned.; Replaced my Ipay 50 mini, which was starting to warp. This Samsung is a brand name you can't go wrong with. Built solid and lots of support to go with it.; acheter pour mon épouse qui a quelques problemes avec ses mains . donc elle est facile pour elle de la manipuler ,"

This is one of the best under 20k.
because the tab at 9 inch is so convenient.
clear good screen.
amazingly loud and crisp sound. you get good bass as well.
I have a Lenovo P11 gen 2 and Realme Pad 2 as well at home.
this one is definitely better in terms of sound output. both volume and quality.

has 3.5mm Jack.
good camera for video call or text scanning.
very light. ideal for reading and casual office work and video.
flawless connectivity - LTE and WiFi both.
I would have bought this even at 15k.
its excellent value for money at 12.5k; Lenovo Tab is good in every aspect. Thank you Amazon.; Very lightweight at 344gm. Good speed for such a low cost tab. I bought 4gb/64gb version which comes with TPU stand in the factory box itself. Also had protection glass free and charger also. Very convenient. Good battery life. Sound quality is very good.; ; I liked the 9 inch size of this tablet, not too big nor too small. Also this colour Frost blue looks awesome.
Tablet performance is very nice.Didnt see any lags whatsoever with my initial 2 days usage now.
The clearcase backcover along with the stand and the tempered glass also coming with the package is an added advantage.
Display is very good and sound is also nice and loud. Battery also lasts long as far as I used.
Overall a decent performance tablet in perfect size.; tablet restarting again and again mic also stopped working had to restart then it work. getting stuck restart on its own and then work . worst experience need to return it; Battery drains out fast; I havent used it continuously for long hours but still I would say the battery is really very good. I mainly bought it for watching movies and it does that job pretty well.

But sometimes when I scroll through, the animations of the GUI felt laggy. I think the processor is not that capable to manage heavy applications. As I dont use if for gaming I am not considering it as a drawback.

And I think they have put the right price tag for the product"

I was about to return it when I decided to give it another try! Luckily,
I was able to set it up easily! This tablet is wonderful! Clear picture, very thin and light weight. I am very happy with this tablet and I recommend it. 5 ✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️; Cette tablette ne fonctionne pas au Canada. J’ai parlé à un technicien de Samsung qui m’a dit de contacter Amazon. Incapable de parler à quelqu’un chez Amazon!; Very Happy With It; If you're looking to play casually. Sure. But if you're looking to play professionally or top-tier. Nope. It runs the game just fine, but the screen jitters when you move your camera. It makes precise aiming incredibly impossible sometimes the swiping is fast and sometimes it's slow, it has to do with how the screen registers where your finger is.

And if you play with a six-finger cloth or so many fingers on the screen that this doesn't even know how to sense your fingers.

If you're only looking for performance then this is good, but if you're looking to improve and accurately shoot at people, I can't recommend this.

My previous device was the Apple iPad Pro 2020 11-in and I played professionally on that.

The screen jitteriness on this one makes it almost impossible to be consistently accurate when shooting at people.; Purchased for my wife and she loves everything about it. Nice clear display, great sound quality, and quite a snappy performer. We have had several android tablets but always go back to Samsung. Connects easily to the internet and mobile hotspot from her phone so she can watch her tv shows anywhere. She is very happy and so am I, very happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone."

Thankfully Samsung has stepped up their game, which is a good thing for my peace of mind. I bought this tablet many many months ago for my mother, because her main use case include reading scripts from ancient apocrypha and watching the most obscure YouTube videos known to mankind. Honestly I'd go insane if I wade through the junk that accumulates on boomer communication devices. That being said you're not here to listen to me vent, so let's get to the point.

[Display] - 4/5
It's a 10.5 inch TFT panel that carries the exceptional Samsung display quality. There is no sAMOLED functionality, and honestly I wouldn't expect it for this kind of price. The resolution is 1920x1200 which is more than enough for consuming content on a screen of this size, this includes YouTube videos, games and books. That being said this display is quite excessive for boomers who will only use the tablet for reading, you can do better buy buying a tablet half the price.

I saw a few students asking if this tablet supports the S-Pen on forums, I tested it out and no S-Pen is not supported. But I did find a few videos and posts that show people using those capacitive stylus to take notes in S-Pen and do some art. Also there is no Dex available for this tablet so keep that in mind for those that are using the tablet for studies.

[Connectivity] - 5/5
It has wifi and Bluetooth, literally all you need for home use. The connections are snappy and I haven't faced any issues setting it up, my mom haven't faced any issues either, despite her claiming that Bluetooth will cause cancer...

[Performance and Storage] - 4/5
I mean I am only giving 4/5 because it looks more critical. I don't use this device to properly stress test i, I did try playing some games on it and it seemed pretty snappy, I didn't download PUBG because my mother isn't a budding eSports pro based in Noida. It has an ""Octa Core Processor"" which is mot probably based on Unisoc architecture(arguably less reliable than Exynos and Qualcomm but that doesn't matter for light users like boomers). The most action this tablet sees is when my mother uses the Facebook app. I bought the 4GB RAM and 64 GB storage version because it is more than enough for my mother, I might add a 128GB SD card just in case she decides to install WhatsApp on it. 4GB RAM is more than enough for almost all modern applications and use cases, sure in 2023 8GB is the norm, but the tablet has not slowed down even a bot for my mother. I honestly wouldn't recommend you but this tablet for gaming if that is your primary use case.

[Camera] - 3.5/5
This is the crux of the usage for boomers, an absolute make or break situation, and honestly this tablet passes with flying colors. The front camera is positioned on the side allowing your eyes and face to be centered in a video call while the tablet is in landscape mode. This is a big win, and honestly places the tablet leagues ahead of the competition which will make you look schizophrenic during video calls as your eyes dash from side to side away from the camera. The front facing camera is 5MP and Samsung's software does a good enough job to make sure the image quality is good, I tested out a video call with my mother and the quality was very good in mediocre lighting. The rear camera is 8MP and does a very good job in scanning documents and for the average boomer, provides a good enough picture quality for those emergency neighborhood landfill photos.

I would say this is also more than enough for students who require a table to attend their online classes, because the teach ain't going to care if you look like handsome squidward. All in all the cameras perform their function to the t.

[Software] - 5/5
As far as Android tablets go in terms of software, this is the best you're gonna get. The One UI is the best out there for both power users and for boomers, and it is the thing carrying these tablets forward even with the mediocre hardware. You can multitask easily, install all sort of apps, customize the appearance of the tablet as well as program unique gestures to make life easier for the boomers who'll be using this device. If the boomer you're buying this tablet for was using another android tablet or an iPad, then transitioning to this will be no problem at all. The UI is tailor made to be as user friendly as possible. I kid you not, my mother who barely knows how to use her phone from OnePlus, uses thus tablet effortlessly. Also in my humble opinion the software is well suited for students as well, with a full version of Samsung notes available with the tablet, and many other features like the device profiles that can be set up for focus, entertainment etc. This is a testament to Samsung's software engineers, UI, and UX designers. The software alone should be enough to warrant a purchase.

Depending on when you buy the tablet you will have One UI 5.1 and Android 13 as the latest versions of the software. Anything beyond that is questionable(there will be regular security updates till 2024).

[Battery] - 5/5
It packs a 7000mAh battery that can comfortably the day on a full charge. No problem on that end.

[Conclusion] - 4.5/5
For the boomer/middle schooler in your life, this is a perfect tablet. It'll perform the functions of everything they need while making sure that anything extra will be uncomfortable enough to not pursue. Wallet friendly and very well built. I would say go for it, but with 2023 ending I'm pretty sure they'll be an upgraded option for this tablet in 2024, considering this tablet's support cycle has ended. Though if software us not a problem then you really can't go wrong with this tablet.; I've been using the Samsung Tab A8 for the past few months, and I must say, Samsung has yet again proven itself as a trustworthy brand. This tablet, while not a powerhouse, impressively handles basic functions such as entertainment, light gaming, and file management.

Pros:
1. **Best UI Experience:** Samsung's One UI provides a smooth and user-friendly interface, making the tablet a joy to navigate.

2. **3 Years of Software Update Confirmation:** Samsung's commitment to providing software updates for three years ensures your device remains secure and up-to-date.

3. **Good File Management System and Knox Security:** The tablet excels in file management, and Samsung's Knox security adds an extra layer of protection.

4. **Big Display with Good Build Quality:** The tablet boasts a generous display and solid build quality, enhancing the overall user experience.

5. **Quad Speakers with Very Loud Sound:** The audio experience is excellent with four speakers that deliver loud and clear sound, perfect for entertainment and multimedia.

Cons:
1. *TFT Display Feels Washed Out:* While the display is sizable, the use of a TFT panel results in colors that may feel less vibrant compared to other display technologies.

2. *Slow Charging with Included Charger:* The tablet's bundled 7.5V charger, despite supporting 15V fast charging, extends the charging time to 3-4 hours, which can be a bit of a drawback.

3. *Heavier Than expected:* The tablet is on the heavier side, which may not be ideal for extended one-handed use or portability.

In conclusion, the Samsung Tab A8 is a reliable choice for those seeking a tablet for everyday tasks. It might not be a top-tier performer, but its well-rounded features, secure software support, and quality user interface make it a commendable option for users who prioritize trustworthiness and functionality over cutting-edge specifications.; Pros:
1. Screen size of 10”+ at this price point is a very Good point!
2. Performance is good!
3. The speakers are amazing!
4. Knox Security included
5. Enough detailing to the tab and it feels so premium in hand!
Cons:
1. Samsung could have got an AMOLED into this price…
2. S-pen support or stylus support lacks in this device!
3. Supports fast charging but gets a 8W charger out of the box, takes a healthy time to fill the juice!
One extra note : Kuddos to team samsung for the screen, I have used A7 and now A8 initially without any cover not a single bit of scratch I noticed in the screen! Build is top notch; What i like about A8
-> Its slim
-> Metallic finish
-> Looks premium
-> Its fast enough for me, able to play most of the games and look into my notes.
-> Popup feature and shortcuts are good.
-> Battery life , will last more than a day if under normal usage (Excluding Gaming and watching high resolution videos)
-> Sound quality is awesome
-> Netflix can render HD Quality videos
-> 64 Gb is enough for me , as im not into gaming on Tab
-> great for studies.
-> close to stock android (Compared with google Pixel), did not see any bloat wear other than those apps of Samsung.

Things which could have been better
-> Fast charging (takes more than an hour to fully charge -- close to 2 hours)
-> No Sim feature , hence no calling feature
-> its heavy
-> Bezels could have been more thinner
-> Screen quality is good , but not great when compared to smart phones. But in par with other Tabs in the price segment .

Though price should be a little lower, but the tablet is the best one from Samsung.; Overall a fantastic product. Great screen and in-built speakers. Batter life though is a major disappointment. Given the no-so-ligjt weight, was expecting much better battery. Lasts no more than 4 hours with moderate usage after 85% charge, with screen brightness at less than 50%.; Superb; Great product, loved the display and design. Very handy with good AV quality; ; Did not find it great because no adapter , no ear port , gor some version issue that if you try to use for uploading shorts on YouTube then sound file can not be leaded
Same issue on Facebook.; Over product is good. But I have observed touch issue in this tab."

The e-ink screen is great, and I adore its design, its aesthetic. It's a pleasure to look at, just beautiful.

The writing experience is the best in the e-ink category.
Its e-ink so no eye strain, totally replaces paper for me.
It has no backlight, so using a portable book lamp.

This is a device that is focused on the philosophy of Focus.
This is no Kindle Scribe and there are very few features when compared to onyx boox tab series which is a proper android tablet with an e-ink screen. There are 13.3-inch e-ink devices as well. There are more than 10 brands making these kinds of e-ink devices.

My decision to choose this product was simply because the remarkable 2 has the best writing feel plus the incredible design.

This device is for those who want to avoid digital screens due to eye strain.
And devices such as these make Paper redundant in the digital age.

It's expensive but I have used my kindle extensively for more than a decade without any issues and makes Life incredibly convenient. No more heavy stacks of books and notebooks that I have to manage.; I bought this a few days ago. I am a writer and at any given time I have at least 4 notebooks with different things in it. This is extra confusing, because I suffer from ADHD. This e-notebook has replaced all my other books for taking notes, writing my novel and all of my lists — all in one place! It’s amazing!
But please understand that it will NOT replace your iPad/laptop or phone.
It has no apps and it’s almost solely for writing and sketching.
Yes you could read, but since it doesn’t support kindle but it will not replace your kindle/book reading electronic devices.
Cons:
- the edges gives out raggedy handwriting which is a bit annoying but I write away from it.
- the marker plus pen is heavy and I prefer lighter pens since I write a LOT and after a while, my hand starts cramping. You could use a different pen with the pen tips but I personally haven’t tried that yet.
- it’s black and white. With my physical notebook, I like to use coloured pens to add titles and subtitles. But I can’t with this device. You could use different writing formats like the marker and the calligraphy pen to make up for this but I personally would have liked a coloured screen.
- The folio doesn’t have a slot for the pen so when you close the folio flap, the pen that’s attached to the device sticks out and could easily fall and be lost.
- it’s touchscreen is rudimentary when compared to tablets so it’s slow clicks will take some getting used to.
- quick notes cannot be individually added into folders which is annoying. Only notebooks can. Also, the quick notes are all arranged in the same tab. So if I have one quick note and then at another time, I take another quick note, it won’t show up separately on the main files section. You have to click on the one tab for it and then choose the page from the menu tabs.

Note: these cons are annoying but NOT a deal breaker for me to replace my physical notebooks. I have replaced them all with the remarkable 2 and I have NO regrets!; Remarkable2 is an amazing product and with this e-ink technology one can save lot of papers.
I bought this for my husband who loves to write and he is in love with this product.
He can write notes with his handwriting using remarkable2 and it’s pen. Notes are easy to manage in different folders and search is quite easy.

I highly recommend this for people who loves to write during meetings, or casual talks with your own handwriting. There is so much comfort in writing and managing notes.; ; This tablet is amazing, like nothing I've ever seen before. Everyone who sees it, wants one. I really want the keyboard but it's hard to justify the price after spending this much. However, I'm sure it's worth it, just like this purchase was worth it.

I finally feel some sort of handle on my ADHD need for all the productivity items hahahaha; Recomendable; Entregado antes de lo agendado. Muy buen precio y servicio; The ReMarkable2 is making my life easier daily. I am still learning to use it and leverage the features it contains yet in a few short weeks it is making my work/side hustle/personal life easier. A few simple positives:
It is simplistic. It does one thing and it does it well.
It is distraction free.
Basic usage is intuitive.
Intermediate usage is pretty intuitive with a little guidance.
I still need to dive into training videos to become a power user.
I appreciated the packaging came in recyclable containers.
The ability to write, erase, and move text is super simple.
Organizing is easy once you understand the Folder/Notebook/Quick Sheets structure.

I spent 3 days in a seminar recently. I was able to download the PDF notebook (over 200 pages of documents) into my ReMarkable and then write my notes on the document. I will upload the document back to Dropbox to save/print off later. I had the option of writing my notes on the document or using a Layer (think clear sheet) that I could write on and turn the 2nd layer off if I wanted to see the main document without my notes. That wasn't an issue for me. Later, I did have one page with checklists I needed to use 3 times so I chose to use the Layers for each use and then remove them when I didn't need it anymore.

At work, I have a weekly meeting that traditionally has been one sheet of paper per week and then keeping up with each piece of paper as I needed to go back and review. With the Notebook feature, I now have those meeting notes going into one document that I will add to each week. It's easy to find and no lost pieces of paper. I also have a coaching practice and this allows me to keep notes on clients in one running document instead of multiples I must file and track.

Two things for the creators to consider - first, it would be easier to read downloaded documents with a lighter/color screen. That said, the existing screen didn't stop me from accomplishing what I wanted to accomplish. Second, a pen loop would be helpful as the magnetic pencil can come unattached. That said, placing the ReMarkable with the binder edge down and pencil on top in my bag helps.

I think I have now sold 6 of these to family and friends. At the recent conference there were a few of us who had the ReMarkable2 and we met during a break to share notes and unanimous enthusiasm for this tool.

It is fantastic.; Me ha gustado la interfaz, responde a la escritura como si fuera papel, práctica de tamaño y aunque un poquito pesada es adecuado para transporte.

Me permite fácilmente anotar y convertir a texto si deseo, la aplicación de mi lap y celular (macbook y iPhone) es muy buena, genial para presentar en zoom lo que escribes o haces diagramas, etc.

Bueno para organizar y he cargado algunos libros en PDF y ebook (no de kindle) para leer, la interfaz con power point y word es genial!!! te permite mandarlo a tu reMarkable en un click y ahí trabajarlo, hacer anotaciones, etc. y ya regresar a retrabajarlos después.

Ideal para tener un lugar sin distracciones, no sustituye un ipad y eso es bueno, ya que sustituye el montón de libretas, post it, etc. que tenía por todos lados.

En la relación costo - producto si la veo algo elevada de costo, no por mucho pero si la compraría de nuevo.

Batería buena duración, lo que tengo miedo es que no hay soporte para México para cuando termine mi suscripción anual, espero no tener problemas..."

Will swap this for top of the line samsung or apple tab when budget permits.
Paid full retail. If you find a deal, defo worth it.
(Update) Surprisingly the stand is quite useful. I dont think I'll swap out for another tab soon. This works fine and can be used for couple more years for sure.

(March 2023 Update) still works well for me, no issues at all. Stand is remarkably usable. I dont feel the need to upgrade.; Superb Sound Quality, Screen size is perfect for reading, waching videos and movies.; I am using this to see coding videos and occasional Netflix...works good..liking the stand design. Nails my purpose.
Who needs an audio jack in the era of BT.
Lenovo insists us to look forward.

Will update after few days of usage.

Update: The sound is awesome. Its warm.
Have issues with connecting a 3rd party BT keyboard with it, thought, BT audio/headphones work fine.
This issue is global issue. Lenovo expects to use their keyboard or a branded keyboard like Logitech.
Not a deal breaker!!!; 𝕊𝕠 𝕟𝕚𝕔𝕖 𝕡𝕣𝕠𝕕𝕦𝕔𝕥; Personal use; Nice product"

Our Free, parent-friendly app empowers parents to guide their children on a secure and enriching digital journey.","The Baatu parenting control-enabled tablet offers exceptional value for its price. Its comprehensive features make monitoring the child's activities and tracking their location effortless. The tablet's quality is excellent, with a responsive touchscreen and smooth performance. Its user-friendly interface enhances accessibility for both parents and children. Overall, I highly recommend this tablet to any parent seeking reliable parental control technology.; I bought this for my son .Since everything is online I did not wanted my kid to use mobile & hence I was looking for a tablet & I purchased this.Its easy to use & the best part is it is loaded with lot of alerts which helps in real time.It operates quiet smooth,has a 10.1 inch screen ,super clarity & has a good speaker.As a parent thisbis the best tab for kids.; This tab is a real value for money. I have checked all the features before giving it to my daughter and surprisingly, the performance is really good and the notifications received are accurate. I have tried several other parenting products earlier, so far this is the best buy. would definitely recommend this product.; The lablet has worst quality in terms of body, display, camera and battery.

Instead of 6000 mah battery, i found only 1000 mah batter installed.

The battery drains quikly within an hr of use.

Don't buy, Don't Buy; My son and I both use this tab. I will set screen time for 1 hour, and that is all he gets after coming home from school.

I've been using this for a few weeks. There have been no lags so far, and the performance is good. The 10.1 inch display is praiseworthy and the camera quality is also good.

The heroes are the parental features. Not gonna lie, it was hard to get used to that at the beginning and it took me 2-3 days to get used to those features. Once I got myself familier with everything, I finding them to be very useful. Instead of buying a random device for kids, this initiative by Enable Tab is really good.; Initially I had three tabs in my list to purchase for my kid before ending up in Enable Tablet.

Lenovo M10, Xiaomi Pad 6, Honor X8. Upon in depth research, I came across Baatu Enable.

One thing about Enable - it comes with a LTE SIM calling option and has a lot of parental monitoring features. The processor is mediatek which is pretty decent.

The major usage will be for studies, research, and gaming. Also, I am very cautious on the total hours he spends time everyday on the device. Unlike the other tab, Enable has an option to set up. And instead of just giving a notification that says that you exceed the overall time which can be ingoned in other devices, the Enable tab automatically locks once my kid exhausts the device time. Now I have set 1.15 hours as his daily screentime.

In terms of performance, there are no lags either. Coming to HD video's this plays without any lag. Video Clarity is good. Battery is good continues usage stays for 12hrs usage.

Wifi & Bluetooth connectivity is good. It also has an headphone jack.

The adult content monitor is perfect. It sends me a notification when any negative, bad and inappropirate words are dedected. Same goes with video and images.; I had zero intention to purchase a tab from a new brand like Baatu. But my friend literally forced me to do this. I found their address at google and to my surprise it was just 1km from my place. I went to their office, spoke with the owner. He refused to sell the product directly even though i was ready to pay full cash and he asked me to order online. It took them 4 days to deliver the tab even though i am just 1 km away from their office.

The reason why i am giving 5 star is only for the performance. The parental alerts are good. my daughter is using this for almost 3 months now. i find it safe and getting to know what type of content she is watching. Every feature the owner told me works exactly like he mentioned. It comes with one sim slot which is okay for kids. But if for adults, i prefer dual sim slot just like we get in phones.

The product is good. But the company should consider selling the product offline and not only in online.; Its an inexplicable feeling when you are desperate seeking a solution to a problem since months and there comes a solution with much more than you asked for!
I have a son who is about 4yrs and is studying in a Montessori. As we both parents are working professionals, its a daunting task to manage all chores along with uncompromising Parenting. There are few rules which we had set for ourselves to keep our little one occupied, happy yet be safe physically and mentally. Last week, I brought this awesome product which is *The solution* for most of my concerns!

This Baatu Tab device I have configured and handed to my son and I'm now able to track whether he is at school or has been dropped to the daycare safely post school hours by this incredible feature called Geo Fence. Incidentally, I forgot to charge the device in the morning and while he was at school, I got the notification that the battery is critically low. Hence I could personally call and keep a watch on the child.
Furthermore, by opening the application provided for the parent, I could just keep track of his current location at my wish. Also I can now keep an eye on what apps he is using and for how long. I could also set the limit on screen time day-wise. Basically, during weekends, since I'm home, I have set shorter screen time and we both spend quality time involving in some physical games. One more thing to mention here is that they claim to notify the parent if the child uses or searches any inappropriate content online.
Smarter kids of this generation needs smarter solution!
I'm so glad it also shown me the app which my son installed on the tab accidentally and I could lock that newly installed app through the Baatu parent application itself as I didn't wanted him to get exposed to it.
Now, deep inside me I'm feeling that, I'm giving him the luxury to use a smart-device with smart solution keeping him safe and secure. So Thank you Baatu for this problem-solving product!!"

Battery life is ok. Last for 2 days with moderate use. Speaker is not so good but audible. Needs to be improved; ; Senior citizens using it. All expectations are fulfilled.; the design, screen and usage experience is great, but i was disappointed by the quality of selfie camera, which is blurry, and video call quality is worse. Audio is very good.; good performance. But on network side it is a little bit weaker due to the older processor.; Pros:
1. Blot apps are very low. You'll almost get a pure Android experience with very minimal Lenovo apps.
2. Processor is really very fast for daily usage app. It doesn't feel that we are using mediocre SD 6 series processor. Maker did great optimisation of other hardwares of the tablet with the processor.
3. Battery backup is great.
4. I tested internet speed of the tablet with 5g network. It performed like premium 5g devices. Latency was too low and downloading speed was touching upto 0.9 to 1 Gbps in non peak hours (that will definately vary on location).
5. Audio calls were good. No lacking in switching between 5g to volte during call.
6. Split Screen was OK. Orientation sensor is working fine too.

Average things:
1. Both cameras are very average and basic.
2. Charging technique and charger both are belonging from old gen. machines. Performs very slow.
3. Display and it's brightness both are mediocre.

Cons:
1. Both sound outputs (inbuilt dual speaker and 3.5mm jack) are very bad. Music lover will simply hate that. You can fix only one output quality ie. You can use usb type c for audio output or bluetooth connection which will give great external sound output experience but inbuilt speaker of tablet will disappoint you alot in terms of sound quality and sound level.
2. Biggest disadvantage for me is, it doesn't deliver highspeed internet (90 Mbps plus) to your other devices when you'll connect your other devices with the tablet's wifi hotspot. Although it transmits dual band frequency (5GHz and 2.4 GHz) but it is not able to give downloading speed in your other paired device more than 60 to 90 Mbps. My indication is very clear. For an example, if you're touring in a car and you're using 5g sim in this tablet so that you and your family can enjoy ""high speed internet"" on individual devices through wifi hotspot of this tablet than this won't become true ever in this tab. Even you don't have option to choose preference in btween 2.4 and 5GHz band. I have raised this issue with Lenovo service team but they are very much untrained to resolve this. They take too much time to respond and ultimately they will stop responding when they see they have left a bug in their system. I don't think any update will fix this issue. I am again repeating, it transmits 5Ghz bandwidth frequency (when you use hotspot of the tablet) but doesn't deliver high speed data to any of your wifi5 or wifi6 enabled device. If you'll connect 3 devices than every connected device will get downloading speed below the HSPA network, forget about 4g speed in those devices.

Verdict:
For basic study: 4.5/5

For elder members of family (who doesn't have hearing issues) : 4/5

For music lover: 0/5 (if using external speakers), 2/5 (if you're using aux based headphones), 5/5 (if you're using high quality usb-c to aux converter or bluetooth headphones, speakers etc.)

For multimedia content (in terms of display only): 3/5

Internet Speed on this device while using with wifi/5g connection: 5/5
Internet speed on other connected device(s) with this tablet's 5g sim: 1.5/5

Battery 4.5/5

Gps: 5/5

Calling and messaging: 4.5/5

Processor performance (when comparing this to other SD695 and 8GB RAM based devices): 5/5

Conclusion: one who is looking for 5g enabled budget tablet, I will say please wait for few more months (if you're not in hurry) because as of now, no budget 5g tablet are giving expected outcomes."

This is one of the best under 20k.
because the tab at 9 inch is so convenient.
clear good screen.
amazingly loud and crisp sound. you get good bass as well.
I have a Lenovo P11 gen 2 and Realme Pad 2 as well at home.
this one is definitely better in terms of sound output. both volume and quality.

has 3.5mm Jack.
good camera for video call or text scanning.
very light. ideal for reading and casual office work and video.
flawless connectivity - LTE and WiFi both.
I would have bought this even at 15k.
its excellent value for money at 12.5k; Lenovo Tab is good in every aspect. Thank you Amazon.; Very lightweight at 344gm. Good speed for such a low cost tab. I bought 4gb/64gb version which comes with TPU stand in the factory box itself. Also had protection glass free and charger also. Very convenient. Good battery life. Sound quality is very good.; ; I liked the 9 inch size of this tablet, not too big nor too small. Also this colour Frost blue looks awesome.
Tablet performance is very nice.Didnt see any lags whatsoever with my initial 2 days usage now.
The clearcase backcover along with the stand and the tempered glass also coming with the package is an added advantage.
Display is very good and sound is also nice and loud. Battery also lasts long as far as I used.
Overall a decent performance tablet in perfect size.; tablet restarting again and again mic also stopped working had to restart then it work. getting stuck restart on its own and then work . worst experience need to return it; Battery drains out fast; I havent used it continuously for long hours but still I would say the battery is really very good. I mainly bought it for watching movies and it does that job pretty well.

But sometimes when I scroll through, the animations of the GUI felt laggy. I think the processor is not that capable to manage heavy applications. As I dont use if for gaming I am not considering it as a drawback.

And I think they have put the right price tag for the product"

Frankly speaking, the Tab S9 series was a decent but incremental upgrade over the S8 series and even though the inclusion of IP68 rating and SD-8 G2 were very important, the asking price was still stratospheric.
Anyway, I had my eyes on this for a while and since the offers were decent, I bought one.
I have used almost all types of tablets and tablet OSs' but the Tab S8+ with android 13 and One UI 5.1 is the best experience I've had using a tablet form factor device.
Everything is buttery smooth, the S pen is super functional, multitasking is really effortless and the hardware is just crazy good (screen and speakers especially). There is no lag, no stuttering, app crashes or anything of that sort. The pre-loaded system apps from Samsung are quite functional and there are tons of settings and tweaks that you can do to get the most of your device.
This is isn't to say it's flawless; the battery life could've been better (although it's not as bad as most reviews have put it, standby battery life is actually quite good). The tablet is quite large with a case so it's defintely not meant for single handed use.
All-in-all this is a great piece of tech which works well and should cater to any power-user who's looking for a good productivity device.; It's so light and the display is fantastic. Given the 4 os updates and 5 yrs of security updates, it's worth it at the price now it if you like Android. The s pen is the cherry on the top. Keyboard cover which has to be sent along with the order was not sent. Ther was some ambiguity regd the redemption on Samsung website as well. However received an email from amason with a gift code to redeem the keyboard cover like 1 day back. It would have been better if Samsung and Amazon communicated this previously so as to avoid agony and confusion of the consumers.; If you have wanted all the specs of a good laptop but want to carry it around like a Tab then here it is, the Samsung S8 plus tab is the one for you. Has notable features and easy to use. One another thing I like about it is the Stylus that comes with the tab which is damn smooth and a pleasure to write along. The video and audio quality is commendable. Liked it overall; Placed order on 10th March (in pre order period)
Recieved 20th...
No free keypad was delivered as promised
Contacted Amazon tem, assured will be delivered within few days...
Contacted Samsung, they said redemption is valid only if we purchase through Samsung app...

I'm pissed that what was promised wasn't delivered!
Rest , it is slightly pricey... But till now the performance has been awesum... Full marks for the S- pen ... User friendly... Verry light weight... Best part,having Best of Windows & Android, which no Apple product can offer...
Go for it...; See first of all i literally gave my time researching bczz i had to choose between iPad Pro and samsung s8 plus I was waiting for the sale i literally hot very much confused between the two. But after some days i released that samsung is better and now thanks to Amazon I got it at 55k which is a heak of a deal for this beast just battery drains a quite fast but other than that the multitasking or the note taking is just brilliant and better than iPad cause I have used iPad also and the super amoled display is just sheer class. If you are thinking of tablet and have a good budget just go for it it is quite larger for multitasking but also portable not like s8 ultra; 12.4 inch display, with a very delicate form factor and excellent build quality.
Excellent device for reading documents, editing however inferior to the Apple IPad Pro when it comes to consistency of frame rate.
The biggest scam, which reviewers on YouTube conveniently skip, is the video quality issues, the multimedia apps like Netflix, Prime, Disney plus and so on have significant video quality issues. Despite frequent follow up with support of said apps, turns out problem is with the tablet itself.
Some say it’s a problem with the code, there are some quick fixes available which work for some people and in most cases don’t.
Video playback has parts of video blurred, blown up with insanely disproportionate lighting leading to some parts of the screen displaying a blurry mess.
Followed up with 3 other users of the Tab S8+, read a lot of online user messages, everyone has the same problem.
It just doesn’t seem worth it, to spend almost 60,000 for a tablet that advertises as an amazing multimedia companion only to find out it’s a complete waste of money.
Tablet can’t play YouTube beyond 1080p for many videos that are available in quality greater than 1080p.
It just sucks to pay so much and have such a disappointing experience
There is no return option available nor is the support you receive post sale satisfactory.
You will regret it.
It will cost insanely more but Go for the IPad Pro.; Excellent purchase. Really loved the notes feature. Can write and convert to text or use the handwriting to text in keyboard, or leave the notes in handwriting and the search button even picks those up. Excellent latency of S-Pen. Not a single ounce of regret on spending so much money. Can easily replace a general purpose laptop.; You can see memes on it all day long and make your own memes with the s pen. 10/10, would recommend for memes."

Slowness on day to day activity.
No sim card supported.
No photoshop software installation support.

Overall worst experience with this product.

And Amazon is did cruelest play and made customer frustrated for returning this product even though tech team approved for return.
Finally Amazon fabricated the customer(myself)who bought the product itself is not available for return everytime (almost 6 to 7 times i have rescheduled it for return) and they cancelled the return request itself and ask us to use the defective product.

Worst experience with Amazon. And my money is wasted on this defective product.; In this price no one brand provide 2.5 k Amoled Display, with great JBL speaker , and powerful prosseser optimise special for tablet, Tablet mode is best and even PC mode is very good after Apple and Samsung Lenovo is the best brand for tablet, Highly recommend this tablet for all your need thanks Lenovo for this product; After 1 month of purchased, the S Pen 3 precision is giving floating air command on placing 1 cm above the display, due to which any kind of works by the Pen 3 is not possible as navigation is not controlled.; Great I was going for Samsung at double price but this gave me better storage at half price and OLED screen too is awesome,it's Best OLED Tablet under 30K for sure in this sale.; I purchased this tab from Amazon and writing this review after using tab for 3 months. First of all please don't buy it. Spending 45K on such such Chinese level 3rd grade product is waste. When the new tab came in hand and opened with excitement, the tab was not detecting the pen. after some time almost 4/5 hours or research, it worked some how. then after one month all of sudden the pen became over sensitive and was not able use at all. After calling the support, the asked to factory reset, after doing this, it started. In 3rd moth the pen stopped charging, now the tab is in service center almost 22 days has been passed no support form Lenovo. My suggestion is don't buy this tab. its not worth.; It's an extremely beautiful display at this price point. Lenovo has delivered a masterpiece for content consuming, gaming and good productivity. No other tablet at this price point is offering OLED DISPLAY @2.5 K resolution and Dolby Vision, HDR 10+ AND DOLBY ATMOS JBL speakers. Just go for it.; Tab is good but sometimes it's UI stop working.
Most worst part is percision pen 3
It stop working after 2 months of buying.
Also Service centres are very less and did not give online service."

Better to put a case to keep the tab protected from fall.; Good price bast tab g70; Its been a month and the Tab wont turn onn; ; Good 👍; I use this tablet a secondary to my iPad and obviously there's no comparison between the two but still a new tablet with no gaming and heavy usage (only used for Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, and browsing the internet it lacks being fluidic. But I guess that's because overall Google does not provide a seperate OS for tablets and basically transitions between the apps and screen rotation feels slow and that too on day 1. Plastic on the back heats up quickly. Overall build is good. For the price of ₹15000/- on sale, I will not complain but I wish basic OS slowness could be improved. No bad review to MOTOROLA, they did a great job, it's Google who's the culprit and losing at the tablet market.; -There are some issue regarding UI no responding again and again this issue is mainly due to update of Android 11 to 12 its keep on irritating but after factory reset device working perfectly fine without any delay and lags.

-This tab is rebranded version of lenovo P11 plus.
-This tablet support LENOVO PRECISION PEN 2 and plam rejection.
-Speaker are not that loud but you can easily hear things even outside
-I also tried BGMI @ smooth plus extreme using GFX settings it's able to maintain 50-60 fps permanently. And gyroscope works perfectly while gaming

Durable, good screen and decent battery life.; ; Dieses Tablet ist sehr schön sehr leicht und vor allen Dingen sehr flexibel es hat hinten eine schutzhülle aus Metall damit es Stöße und andere Gegenstände abwehren kann kann ich weiterempfehlen👍👍😊😊 und es ist für unterwegs und für zu Hause praktisch; I love my Lenovo tablet! This tablet has a lot going for it. I was looking to replace my Dragon Touch, that only lasted 10 months, and the extra money it cost for this tablet is so worth it. I've also learned my lesson and got an extended warranty. I've just never needed extended warranties with my Kindles since they are such work horses and last a couple of years, at least. My husband uses an old Kindle of my daughters that has got to be at least 5 years old.

I am writing this review as a quadriplegic with limited use of my hands. So some of the things I'm going to mention are a particular use for me, but I'm sure are great features for anyone.

The screen is clear and bright and doesn't cause eye strain for me. The brightness setting gives me lots of choice on how bright I want the screen. There is a built-in eye protection setting if you want to reduce the blue light coming from your screen. I do not use it because I prefer the brighter screen.

The on screen keyboard gives me a lot more options for use than my Dragon Touch did. It is a good size and isn't as overly sensitive as my Dragon Touch keyboard. It gives me a little more time to linger on a letter before it switches to the alternate keys (a verses ã). It also has a predictor pro built in which my last tablet did not have. The microphone setting, so that I can do speech to text, is very good. The keyboard also comes with its own clipboard setting.

The speaker is acceptable, but then again, I'm not an audiophile who needs amazing speakers. I do have it hooked up to my Bose Bluetooth speaker, which gives me very nice sound. The speaker works for general web browsing and YouTube viewing.

There is plenty of space for all my apps. I haven't even inserted a microSD card, because I still have hordes of space left. It feels fast enough when loading and I haven't noticed any lag time.

I love the built-in setting which allows me to wake up my tablet by either double tapping it or raising it up. It's very hard for me to be constantly pushing the power button to wake it up. This feature alone is a big deal for me.

I like that there is a indicator light that tells me when my tablet is charging (red, charging - green, charged) which also can be set to flash when I get a notification. Both features can be disabled under the display settings. I would think that the flashing light might be very useful for the seeing impaired.

It doesn't take long to charge and holds a charge for a lot longer than my Dragon Touch. I also use a Kindle HD (which I love, but it's obviously not Android) and my cell phone, so I do not use this for really long periods of time. Even with sporadic usage I get two days of use out of it before I have to charge it again. I also don't notice any warmth or heat coming from the battery when I charge it.

I'm sure as I get to know my tablet better I will find other settings and options to explore. Overall, I am very happy with my new tablet. Great job Lenovo!; Affordale tablet but need morepublic media exposure"

excellent build quality. feels solid. good battery Screen On Time. Camera is good enough for document scanning and such.
Ideal for office works, reading, browsing, media consumption and such everyday tasks. moderate gaming can be done. (remember you are getting Helio G99 which is a mid-range Mobile gaming processor. and at 15k no other brand gives G99. kudos to Redmi.)
Display is good though contrast and viewing angles can be better. still better at par with any IPS LCD under 20k price.
Speakers have good clarity, loudness, and good sterio output.
Charging speed is decent but still not comparable to current smartphone standards.
accessories are easily available.

No LTE - which is a minus point.
Wifi reception is stable and good though.
No 3.5mm port which is a real minus point.
No active pen support -which is acceptable. No other company gives pen support at 15k anyway.

in general - excellent value for money at 15k.

Alternatives with same /similar processor - Realme Pad 2 (11.5 inch, G99, WiFi+LTE) at 19k.
OnePlus Pad Go (11"", G99, WiFi only) at 20k.
Lenovo P11 Gen2 (11.5, G99, Wifi+LTE) at 20k.
Lenovo M10 plus at 18-19k.; Multi purpose tab and has good sound quality, battery life; ; Using this tab for a month now, the 6GB variant is a really good VFM product. great screen quality, good responsive system features and battery life. I use it for office work and multimedia, both work seamlessly. The sound quality is a highlight, amazing to hear the quad speaker. There is option for multi-window with this version, i don't use it as much.

the only 'can be better' aspect is the network connectivity, the tab needs to be closer to the router than maybe apple's or Samsung's product, speed through-put is good but if you move to <15ft with walls in b/w then the connectivity starts to wobble - effecting video quality. I got an extender to solve the issue - it worked, added expense was only 1K.

I was considering mi pad 6 or ipad 9th gen, but expandable storage was a must-have. worthy upgrade for my use.; Good build quality.
Worth of money.
Camera is not upto standard.; ; perfect hai; For the price range the tablet is total worth"

I have 4/64gb wifi only model

1. Battery backup is good (no gaming only YouTube and browsing)

3. Out of 4gb free ram will be 1.5/1.7 gb even when no app is installed only system app will take half of ram
4. Storage is good 18 is taken by system 45.4gb is free in it.
5. Camera is most terrible both front and back I have taken photo of file word are not that sharp and visible.
6. Display is good but not sharp it's ok to see content in it
7. Not played any game on it but it can manage some what casual game no high end expectations
8. There was rarely some time display touch was not good .
9. Multitasking is good between two app Ram hold only 5/6 app in background more than that is not handled it will stop
10. Software optimisation is excellent in it .if it have more better hardware then it will be killed it
I hope you get the idea from it go for higher it will be more better than this and; This review is not for product but the delivery and return process of amazon. Ordered this tablet and found out that this one is not charging at all, so called the amazon customer support and they said 'no worries, get a diagnostic report from samsung service centre and with that certificate, return the product'. So i went to samsung care and the guys over there helped getting me the diagnostic report certificate named ""dead on arrival"" (DOA).

Now, i called the amazon customer support and they arranged pickup for return of tablet (with DOA certificate) and delivery of new tablet. And here comes the paradox... (Remember why i was returning the tablet? It wasn't charging, and so it was literally dead on battery)
The delivery guy says he needs to see the IMEI number on the device in the 'about device' menu on the battery dead tablet, i said it is impossible since the tablet won't start. He said 'then I can not complete the process' and left.

I again made a call to amazon customer service and the guy on the line said 'sir, you are our prime member, we'll have it sorted in 24 hrs' and again arranged the pickup + delivery.

Again the loop started, the delivery guy wanted the IMEI number on dead tablet and without that he wouldn't process the delivery of new tablet.
I was stuck in this paradox of showing IMEI number of the dead device by going to about section of device which needs it to get powered up first (that the tab obviously can't)

But this delivery guy was considerate enough, he said, let's try putting it on charge and even if I get pic of that 'about device' menu that shows the IMEI number, I'll process the return right away. My luck struck the right chord over there and i was able to switch the tablet on in the Nth attempt (10+ attempts were made to charge the device but it would just vibrate once and then proceed to blackout) it started and with 1% battery indicating in the corner i got the IMEI number on the screen from the device setting and the delivery guy took picture of it and then the tablet died.

I got the new tablet as replacement and it's working good.

So who's at fault here for this headache? Amazon customer service said that the tablet will be replaced just with certificate, delivery team was more interested in starting the dead tablet to verify the IMEI number... So I guess it's the communication between the amazon and it's delivery team.; Good product as expected; The tablets display is good. Average performance. Camera gets the work done with 10x zoom doing average. Memory is okay for multitasking. It is indeed the best for its price.; All functions are as expected. P99 processor at affordable price.; Convenient to use; After 10 days of usage the tab is restarting on its own. Now ai have to go to the service center which is 50kms away. Now I am doubting the products sild by Amazon.; J'adore cette tablette pas trop grosse juste parfaite je peux faire plusieurs choses en même temps plusieurs applications ouverte et aucun bogue.La caméra n'est pas fameuse mais bon On peut relié nos appels et messages textes de notre téléphone dessus. Le son est bon n'as pas de stylet par contre. Il se peut que vous ne réussissez pas à mettre Canada comme pays choisissez l'Australie et français ça ne change rien. Je suis surprise de sa rapidité et l'autonomie de batterie Samsung offre vraiment de la qualité à bon prix.; What I like..........Nice size, span a grip with one hand, easy carry. It will fly a DJI mini 2 drone. It will connect to an external HD. It does have an SD card slot and SIM card slot. And it has a real Samsung processor. Not many do. The only thing I noticed, it's not powerful enough to run Video editing software. But plays videos no problem.; Pros: Fast & smooth operation.

Cons: Texts appear blurry; eye protection mode doesn't work as intended; screen fails to register my touch 20% of the time.

Returned.; Replaced my Ipay 50 mini, which was starting to warp. This Samsung is a brand name you can't go wrong with. Built solid and lots of support to go with it.; acheter pour mon épouse qui a quelques problemes avec ses mains . donc elle est facile pour elle de la manipuler ,"

Good: 1) Loved the built quality, color and the look of it;
2) Simple UI with almost zero customization (good as well as bad); Good because unlike Samsung and Chinese tablet they are not bloated with useless features integrated into it. Bad because the UI is too simplistic and so dated that basic Google search widget on main screen cant be removed *bug not a feature;
3) Kept it because, in a sea filled with Chinese tablet - Acer is a renoun name - I believe more in privacy & security than bells & whistles, if they can do basic stuff like browsing, YouTube, read e-books which it can do effortlessly, except for, when browser (twitter) used with VPN simultaneously there is little jitter or screen lag to be noticed;
4) Excellent network reception, I was really impressed with these for this capabilities which outshines my Samsung phone; calls are great on these by the way;
5) Excellent typing accuracy and haptic feedback, great for jotting notes;
7) Fanstastic for E-Reading or E-Book.

Bad: 1) Terrible Native Acer Camera app (too outdated) - disgusted they are not only poorly optimized, but how it creates a system-wide issue when used with third party messenger apps like WhatsApp, Telegram etc for video calls. Also they have failed to make use of the sensor making the camera inverted when used in portrait mode;
2) Totally not in sync with Google, the tab purportedly runs on A12 but in terms of security updates they are all dated from January (luckily post mailing them - got security update for August);

Hoping Acer will soon push major firmware update to address the camera issue, launch polished Acer Launcher, and to overall fix Acer software layering on Android OS for better visual & sofware experience.
I just wish Acer - instead of providing useless cheap earphone - had used better processing chipset. ***Please no amount of RAM will enhance the processing capabilites of poor chipset.; Couldn't believe Acer came up with an outdated product. It doesn't feel like a 6GB RAM Tablet, it lags like a decade old 2GB variant. It Definitely doesn't justify the price. Not to expect a smooth interface. Feels very cheap. I don't recommend this Tablet. Totally disappointed.; ; This table is having some problem.There is a lag problem this is second time i am facing the same issue.; It's stopped working within 7days of working, Amazon response poor on Replacement. Acer response very poor; Display is the best feature of this product, I am amazed at how clear the videos are. One of my best purchases on Amazon."

This was super easy to set up the parental controls, choose how long his sessions would last, what hours of the day he can use it, and what content in the internet he could have access to. There are tons of games on there, even in the most restricted settings, that are good for kids to play and learn stuff with. We’ve had it for 6 months, with no issues so far.; The pritcom tablet has been an AMAZING tool for teaching our son his colors, speech and critical thinking skills. We have loved it, and we love that it has parental controls and access to the google play store. The case that came with it has been great, my son loves the handle on the back because it makes it easy for him to hold and prop up. The battery lasts almost all day, and overall this tablet feels like it is a great value for money when considering tablets for your kids.; This tablet is excellent. The battery is good, the screen is gorgeous and the weight is hefty enough to not feel too heavy or too light to feel cheap. It would have been a perfect 5 except for the micro-USB port for charging. USB-C would have been more than welcome but this tablet is still a keeper.; This is great for my 4 year old but only lasted for a year. Now the battery doesn’t hold charge."

It came with preinstalled games and I was able to easily install other apps for my son such as kids YouTube and Minecraft. I like the safety features available. My son is eight and I love knowing that he can’t be searching the Internet or watching grownup YouTube without my permission and supervision. It allows you to filter the play store by rating too, so my son cannot even see games, movies, or apps that are rated over the limits I have set. I can set a password so he cannot purchase apps that cost money without me entering the password. Or of course I can block his access to the play store completely by putting it in kids mode. The case is a dense foam material. I was expecting silicone, but this material seems durable and protects the corners and the screen if dropped. The speed of this tablet is really nice. Any other kids tablet we have owned have been so slow, from cutting the device on to running apps. Even with a big app like Minecraft, this tablet runs very smoothly. My one complaint would be that the battery life isn’t fantastic. This isn’t a big deal for me. It charges back up very quickly. The charger is a usb type c which I really like. The other type of usb charger stops working so fast, I like that this one uses something more reliable. No wiggling the charger or having to replace it so often. For 40 dollars, this tablet is absolutely a great deal. 20 dollars less than what seems to be average and so far it has outshined all the other kids tablets we have owned. I actually just bought another one for my other son’s birthday. Both tablets we got are blue and the color is exactly as pictured. The picture on the outside of the box shows a pink tablet, but near the bar code you can see where it says blue. My son was briefly upset about not getting his favorite color, light blue, because the box showed a pink tablet, but the tablet inside was the correct color.; My one year old loves this, he walks round the house with it, battery life is not so great but it’s good as he gets less screen time, but great buy; Mon fils a adoré sa tablette déjà acheté une autre ailleurs pas la même qualité je suis assez satisfaite pour mon achat.
Je recommande fortement.; Un Tablet perfetto per i bambini, cosi possono giocare con quello e non con il mio telefono 😓
Il tablet è rivestito con una custodia che lo protegge dagli urti, molto carino.
La custodia ha il suo piano di sostegno da appoggiare su qualsiasi ripiano in posizioni desiderate.
Ha solo un problema: se avete più di un bambino a casa, inizieranno a litigare per averlo 😅; This is my second tablet from them! Very slow the quality of the picture was distorted! Does not hold a charge! My other sons broke fast and I didn’t even bother replacing it! So a total of 3 tablet with in 2 months wasted!! Thanks but No THANKS"

The HD display is amazing. However you can't use the tab under direct sun. The touch screen works perfectly fine. The battery life is also good enough for day long use. Watching movie with Dolby Atmos is very good. The speakers are fair enough. You may amplify with good speakers via Bluetooth. The SD card works well on this tab. Overall no issues. Only one drawback is though you can insert SIM but it only works for data and one cannot make voice calls using the tab. However if one uses Jio SIM they need to download voice call app and use Jio fi for making calls. Lenovo clearly states the SIM works for data. I knew this while making the purchase. I am extremely satisfied with the product.; Getting back to tablets after some years.. last one I owned was a flawless Nexus 7

This is a good tab.. great looks..Android 8 to start off with... Not a lot of preloaded crap apps which can't be uninstalled

Some niggles..
1 there is no light sensor.. so auto brightness doesn't work.. irritating to manually adjust brightness up or down
2 I notice some lag.. at times it's butter smooth.. at times isn't.. I don't play games...so can't comment on gaming performance
3 Speakers are nice... but poorly placed on top.. could have been on sides or bottom... Would recommend headphones anyday for any mobile device
4 Not too many accessories at the moment... Only ACM brand comes up.. I ended up buying a case and screen guard and promptly returned both ...case was of horrible quality, screen guard of a diff design
Bought a universal case for 10 inch tablets from emartbuy brand.. far far better quality.. just that it's bigger and not custom fit...as it's a universal case

All in all..am not disappointed with the tab..but for 19k would expect a little better performance; A good device, hard to find at this end of the price range. Display is sharp with adequate brightness. 3 gigs of RAM and 32 gigs internal storage is more than what you get from other tablets at this price. The 10.1 inch display helps a lot. Good screen quality, 10 point touch screen very receptive.
Battery lasts for a decent amount of time, 4850 mAh might seem less, but it pulls the device through the day.
Front facing speakers have decent sound quality, a bit lacking on bass but that can be easily corrected with a good pair of headphones. The Dolby Atmos helps a lot
The system UI is mostly raw Android, with very little bloatware, so it's easy to find your way around it.
Only trouble is that accessories like the screen guard is quite hard to find, even on Amazon. That's the only trouble I find on what is otherwise a magnificent piece of tech.; I bought this for my 7 yr old child few months back and he loved it. Quality is really good but the only problem is battery charging. It takes a lot of time to charge. Moreover it gets hanged in b/w at times.; After 15 days of use of 3GB/64GB.

Never faced any issue of hang or something. Tab is running very smooth & fast enough ( I don't play any game in it).

Battery life is more than satisfactory.

Camera quality is not good enough.. but ok ok in this budget.

Screen resolution is perfect enough.

Guys, don't listen the negative feedbacks. Those confused me a lot before buying.

GO FOR THIS.; Following are my issues
Wifi not connecting
Hotspot will work
Updates are failing
Touch not working properly
Product build quality poor; Working well supporting video watching with good clarity. Charge backup is also good.; I bought this tab in October 2020. This tab is very useful for my online class. All apps are working properly. SMS, jio apps, Microsoft apps, volte calling and all sim is working for this tab. The android version is 9 and it also asked for update android version 10. It is perfect tab. It Is new model tab. The screen quality is superb. Touch screen is also super. In this tab SD card is supporting.
The packing is also good. The selfie camera is not that much bright. But the rear camera is nice. The duel speaker is hearing well. You can buy this tab.
Thank you for reading"

S pen in the box works very well. Unfortunately i missed it somewhere at site during work... ordered another replacement pen. Cons: Lcd display in broad daylight viewing is fair.(found solution: bought anti glare screen protector to reduce daylight glare problem) Since I am using it for my bridge construction work. Heats up very fast under direct sun.( solution:I use umbrella to cover me as well as my tab) now its perfectly works. Mostly suitable for indoor works. For outdoor works go for s9+ which has amoled display.. better viewing in daylight. But just for amoled display spending 30k more not worth. I am happy with my tab after one month of usage. U can go for it when the prices comes below 45k for 5G variant. Now it's price 54k.. I got offer price 43k for silver color and using my credit card offer got it with final price of 41k.; It is overheating; Camera and all other performance is good; Very easy to use with great screen size.
Some great apps to discover all features including the pen.
Drawing on this tablet has been pure enjoyment.; Good product in my point of veiw for students and artists and samsung supplies it in a good way and nice product; I received the product with pen is not working the tablet. raised the complaint within the order closure window. service engineer came and confirmed that it is not working. he informed us that someone from Amazon will contact us for next steps. no one contacted for next 4 days. when i reached out to customer service, they are not ready to speak as the order return window is closed. I have paid Rs.64000 for this and I can't use this product. How can Amazon do business like this. will never buy any product in future.; Good for note taking
S pen is noiseless, and has a soft nib
Good Battery Life
Sleek design; Fantastic product, offers almost e everything I thought of..."

It is clear. The tablet is easy to carry and it's thin but sturdy. The speed is very good. Colors are very bright. Perfect size to carry anywhere. Many features such as the magnification accessibility tool and you can use more than two windows at the same time. The price is incomparable and I would recommend it for college students and working adults. Best tablet I've ever had. Battery is amazing! It lasts at least 5-6 hours and it charges fast. Love it; I spent alot of time researching tablets. I wanted something that had great performance, a big screen, and didnt break the bank. This tablet checked all of those boxes so i decided to buy it. After using it for over a month I am super happy with it and glad I bought this one vs other expensive comparable tablets. This tablet has a pc mode which allows me to stream a godzilla movie while playing a godzilla game at the same time. The playstation remote play works awesomely with it, so I can game on the road. The battery is good, never ran out on me. The stylus it comes with is pretty cool too. I havent used the stylus that much, but it had a button on the side you can assign a specific action to if you want, like taking a picture or what not. The speakers are great and get pretty loud if you need them to. Id recommend getting some bluetooth headphones tho.

This tablet is user friendly and a great product. Bravo Lenovo.; Excellent tablet. Nice display, great sound. I do not notice any lag, which is the highest praise considering the price of the tablet and that my primary device is an iPhone 15 Pro.

The pen works flawlessly, and I also purchased the keyboard case from Lenovo, which is a complete game-changer.; An outstanding Android tablet for surprisingly little money. The screen is really beautiful and bright. The case has a nice balance of curve and chunk to the edges, which combined with the gunmetal background and minimal branding gives it a premium feel. Downsides are the speakers, which are just OK, and the pen, which is too imprecise to be useful for writing. Also the default launcher has to be replaced, a minor one-time inconvenience.; Outstanding tablet. I wish a future upgrade would focus on an Amoled screen, but other than that, the unit is amazing! Fast, powerful capable of handling anything up to the date of this review. Super easy to setup. The size is perfect for viewing content. The pen is very precise an responsive. Nothing negative to mention on this one. Great work from Leonovo. Super delivery service from Amazon."

It came with preinstalled games and I was able to easily install other apps for my son such as kids YouTube and Minecraft. I like the safety features available. My son is eight and I love knowing that he can’t be searching the Internet or watching grownup YouTube without my permission and supervision. It allows you to filter the play store by rating too, so my son cannot even see games, movies, or apps that are rated over the limits I have set. I can set a password so he cannot purchase apps that cost money without me entering the password. Or of course I can block his access to the play store completely by putting it in kids mode. The case is a dense foam material. I was expecting silicone, but this material seems durable and protects the corners and the screen if dropped. The speed of this tablet is really nice. Any other kids tablet we have owned have been so slow, from cutting the device on to running apps. Even with a big app like Minecraft, this tablet runs very smoothly. My one complaint would be that the battery life isn’t fantastic. This isn’t a big deal for me. It charges back up very quickly. The charger is a usb type c which I really like. The other type of usb charger stops working so fast, I like that this one uses something more reliable. No wiggling the charger or having to replace it so often. For 40 dollars, this tablet is absolutely a great deal. 20 dollars less than what seems to be average and so far it has outshined all the other kids tablets we have owned. I actually just bought another one for my other son’s birthday. Both tablets we got are blue and the color is exactly as pictured. The picture on the outside of the box shows a pink tablet, but near the bar code you can see where it says blue. My son was briefly upset about not getting his favorite color, light blue, because the box showed a pink tablet, but the tablet inside was the correct color.; My one year old loves this, he walks round the house with it, battery life is not so great but it’s good as he gets less screen time, but great buy; Mon fils a adoré sa tablette déjà acheté une autre ailleurs pas la même qualité je suis assez satisfaite pour mon achat.
Je recommande fortement.; Un Tablet perfetto per i bambini, cosi possono giocare con quello e non con il mio telefono 😓
Il tablet è rivestito con una custodia che lo protegge dagli urti, molto carino.
La custodia ha il suo piano di sostegno da appoggiare su qualsiasi ripiano in posizioni desiderate.
Ha solo un problema: se avete più di un bambino a casa, inizieranno a litigare per averlo 😅; This is my second tablet from them! Very slow the quality of the picture was distorted! Does not hold a charge! My other sons broke fast and I didn’t even bother replacing it! So a total of 3 tablet with in 2 months wasted!! Thanks but No THANKS"

And after full charge for 2 hours, started using it...It is working butter smooth. Whole family is liking the product. Built in stand design is very handy to use. Tilt and landscape mode is very good. Dont know how to mount in vertical mode. Apart from that, every thing is extraordinary. Worth for the price. I like this because of : 1) build quality for the price. 2) In built stand for convenient usage. 3) Hey Google (voice assistant) feature. we are using extensively. 4) 3 mic feature 5) Classy Looks 6) Excellent Audio quality with JBL and Dolby 7) HD quality videos with nice viewing angles.
Will tell you more after prolonged usage.
Cons: 1. Some what heavier, may be due to metallic stand & JBL speakers etc. But manageable.
First, I was looking for tabs for the price of 15k around...Shortlisted some models from Samsung & Lenevo. THis one is latest and price worthy, though costs 22k.; Writing review after 4 months of use.
Thanks Amazon for quick delivery..Nice packing..
Nice built quality..Back stand is very handy .You can place in 3+ modes.
7000mh battery is Ok..upto 10-12 hrs moderate usage..more than 1day in standby .Display is good..Eye protection mode is OK..JBL speaker is good .Wifi is easy to connect.Sim slot is there but I have not used till now.
3.5 mm audio jack > music is good Dolbi is ok.Dont expect too much

But the worst part is mine hangs every 25-30 mins use..so not good for gaming..Hanging is reported by so many customers here @ Amazon ..It's because of adreno GPU I think..Hanging is so disturbing.I am using it mainly for reading so OK with me..But I am totally dissatisfied with this tab when used for gaming performance..While running it's smooth...but all of a sudden screen blackout and you have to restart the application..
So kindly consider other tabs Samsung 10.1 inch ..
Waiting for a lenovo update to solve the hanging issue

I will give 3.5-4 rating out of 5 according to my experience and expectation; Guys,this is ought to be the best tab under 30k. Don't want to fight with Apple fans. So call it best Android tab under 30k.

The sound quality, build quality, screen, touch response, all are top notch.

The design is certainly 10/10. The in built kick stand took some effort to come out but it is immensely useful.

If there is one thing about this tab, it is the Sound. It is just mind blowing! Even normal multimedia laptops also don't have such loud and clear sound. The quality of sound is awesome!
If there is a second thing about this tab, it is the design, build quality and the in built kick stand.
Many people have talked about being heavy. It doesn't feel heavy though it must be heavier than the usual thin tabs. But given the kickstand you can always keep it on the table and watch. Not to say you cannot hold on your lap. You very well can.

Btw even without any updates it came with Android 10. Not Android 9 as the specs say. That was a concern but I checked on Flipkart and there it said Android 10. Amazon never pays attention to cataloguing.. bad!

If you are looking for a tab,this is got to be your only good choice. Unless you want to spend double of this money or you are an apple fan.; This tablet, even though a bit on costlier side, proves its utility factor. Has a solid screen outlay, and an amazing pair of JLB speakers that could be high-yielding if you are also using it for video meetings or music/workout sessions.
Microphones on three sides of the tablet help efficient sound transfer over different video mediums.
Battery is a bit disappointing, but as the screen is large, this type of output should be expected. Takes 4+ hours to charge from 0 to 100, and it could last up to 15 hours depending on the usage, application load and other factors.
Camera takes clean pictures, and the front one has a decent MP, rendering crispy view while taking pictures or on video calls.
The Google ambient feature is a nice add-on, especially showcasing your personal photos when the tab becomes inactive, serving a dual purpose as a digital photo album.
Receiving and making voice calls is efficient, and those two speakers will help deliver good-conference style calls. Note: This review comes after a two-week usage. Further usage and future performance may change the current direction of the review.; All pros , No cons.
I’m using this model since last more than a 18 months.

-Very good and loud sound with JBL speaker
-Display is very very good and comfortable for long hour watch/work
- No operational issue yet. You can Go for it without a second though 👍; It's literally a very good tab. With extremely loud speaker with dolby atmos and it's having a very good screen. But this is slightly costly tab. But i can suggest you a tab which is better than this tab that is oppo pad air. So i am. also having this oppo tab. It's more better than this tab as complared to the amount, quality, speakers, display, touch screen etc. You can go to the official website of oppo and you can order it.Oppo pad airamount is just 15000 as compared to this tab. So my suggestion is leave this tab and go to Oppo pad air. 🙂🙂😊; Its good value for money product but its not IPAD... The touch is not that good; d software layout features r not great; its not very fast....

Decent product for regular use but bad for gaming... d screen hangs and it stops.. abruptly

Overall::: Buy for regular use like OTT, Emails and social media

Also d stand come vd d product and is one f d best features ... d stand improves d experience of d product"

Thankfully Samsung has stepped up their game, which is a good thing for my peace of mind. I bought this tablet many many months ago for my mother, because her main use case include reading scripts from ancient apocrypha and watching the most obscure YouTube videos known to mankind. Honestly I'd go insane if I wade through the junk that accumulates on boomer communication devices. That being said you're not here to listen to me vent, so let's get to the point.

[Display] - 4/5
It's a 10.5 inch TFT panel that carries the exceptional Samsung display quality. There is no sAMOLED functionality, and honestly I wouldn't expect it for this kind of price. The resolution is 1920x1200 which is more than enough for consuming content on a screen of this size, this includes YouTube videos, games and books. That being said this display is quite excessive for boomers who will only use the tablet for reading, you can do better buy buying a tablet half the price.

I saw a few students asking if this tablet supports the S-Pen on forums, I tested it out and no S-Pen is not supported. But I did find a few videos and posts that show people using those capacitive stylus to take notes in S-Pen and do some art. Also there is no Dex available for this tablet so keep that in mind for those that are using the tablet for studies.

[Connectivity] - 5/5
It has wifi and Bluetooth, literally all you need for home use. The connections are snappy and I haven't faced any issues setting it up, my mom haven't faced any issues either, despite her claiming that Bluetooth will cause cancer...

[Performance and Storage] - 4/5
I mean I am only giving 4/5 because it looks more critical. I don't use this device to properly stress test i, I did try playing some games on it and it seemed pretty snappy, I didn't download PUBG because my mother isn't a budding eSports pro based in Noida. It has an ""Octa Core Processor"" which is mot probably based on Unisoc architecture(arguably less reliable than Exynos and Qualcomm but that doesn't matter for light users like boomers). The most action this tablet sees is when my mother uses the Facebook app. I bought the 4GB RAM and 64 GB storage version because it is more than enough for my mother, I might add a 128GB SD card just in case she decides to install WhatsApp on it. 4GB RAM is more than enough for almost all modern applications and use cases, sure in 2023 8GB is the norm, but the tablet has not slowed down even a bot for my mother. I honestly wouldn't recommend you but this tablet for gaming if that is your primary use case.

[Camera] - 3.5/5
This is the crux of the usage for boomers, an absolute make or break situation, and honestly this tablet passes with flying colors. The front camera is positioned on the side allowing your eyes and face to be centered in a video call while the tablet is in landscape mode. This is a big win, and honestly places the tablet leagues ahead of the competition which will make you look schizophrenic during video calls as your eyes dash from side to side away from the camera. The front facing camera is 5MP and Samsung's software does a good enough job to make sure the image quality is good, I tested out a video call with my mother and the quality was very good in mediocre lighting. The rear camera is 8MP and does a very good job in scanning documents and for the average boomer, provides a good enough picture quality for those emergency neighborhood landfill photos.

I would say this is also more than enough for students who require a table to attend their online classes, because the teach ain't going to care if you look like handsome squidward. All in all the cameras perform their function to the t.

[Software] - 5/5
As far as Android tablets go in terms of software, this is the best you're gonna get. The One UI is the best out there for both power users and for boomers, and it is the thing carrying these tablets forward even with the mediocre hardware. You can multitask easily, install all sort of apps, customize the appearance of the tablet as well as program unique gestures to make life easier for the boomers who'll be using this device. If the boomer you're buying this tablet for was using another android tablet or an iPad, then transitioning to this will be no problem at all. The UI is tailor made to be as user friendly as possible. I kid you not, my mother who barely knows how to use her phone from OnePlus, uses thus tablet effortlessly. Also in my humble opinion the software is well suited for students as well, with a full version of Samsung notes available with the tablet, and many other features like the device profiles that can be set up for focus, entertainment etc. This is a testament to Samsung's software engineers, UI, and UX designers. The software alone should be enough to warrant a purchase.

Depending on when you buy the tablet you will have One UI 5.1 and Android 13 as the latest versions of the software. Anything beyond that is questionable(there will be regular security updates till 2024).

[Battery] - 5/5
It packs a 7000mAh battery that can comfortably the day on a full charge. No problem on that end.

[Conclusion] - 4.5/5
For the boomer/middle schooler in your life, this is a perfect tablet. It'll perform the functions of everything they need while making sure that anything extra will be uncomfortable enough to not pursue. Wallet friendly and very well built. I would say go for it, but with 2023 ending I'm pretty sure they'll be an upgraded option for this tablet in 2024, considering this tablet's support cycle has ended. Though if software us not a problem then you really can't go wrong with this tablet.; I've been using the Samsung Tab A8 for the past few months, and I must say, Samsung has yet again proven itself as a trustworthy brand. This tablet, while not a powerhouse, impressively handles basic functions such as entertainment, light gaming, and file management.

Pros:
1. **Best UI Experience:** Samsung's One UI provides a smooth and user-friendly interface, making the tablet a joy to navigate.

2. **3 Years of Software Update Confirmation:** Samsung's commitment to providing software updates for three years ensures your device remains secure and up-to-date.

3. **Good File Management System and Knox Security:** The tablet excels in file management, and Samsung's Knox security adds an extra layer of protection.

4. **Big Display with Good Build Quality:** The tablet boasts a generous display and solid build quality, enhancing the overall user experience.

5. **Quad Speakers with Very Loud Sound:** The audio experience is excellent with four speakers that deliver loud and clear sound, perfect for entertainment and multimedia.

Cons:
1. *TFT Display Feels Washed Out:* While the display is sizable, the use of a TFT panel results in colors that may feel less vibrant compared to other display technologies.

2. *Slow Charging with Included Charger:* The tablet's bundled 7.5V charger, despite supporting 15V fast charging, extends the charging time to 3-4 hours, which can be a bit of a drawback.

3. *Heavier Than expected:* The tablet is on the heavier side, which may not be ideal for extended one-handed use or portability.

In conclusion, the Samsung Tab A8 is a reliable choice for those seeking a tablet for everyday tasks. It might not be a top-tier performer, but its well-rounded features, secure software support, and quality user interface make it a commendable option for users who prioritize trustworthiness and functionality over cutting-edge specifications.; Pros:
1. Screen size of 10”+ at this price point is a very Good point!
2. Performance is good!
3. The speakers are amazing!
4. Knox Security included
5. Enough detailing to the tab and it feels so premium in hand!
Cons:
1. Samsung could have got an AMOLED into this price…
2. S-pen support or stylus support lacks in this device!
3. Supports fast charging but gets a 8W charger out of the box, takes a healthy time to fill the juice!
One extra note : Kuddos to team samsung for the screen, I have used A7 and now A8 initially without any cover not a single bit of scratch I noticed in the screen! Build is top notch; What i like about A8
-> Its slim
-> Metallic finish
-> Looks premium
-> Its fast enough for me, able to play most of the games and look into my notes.
-> Popup feature and shortcuts are good.
-> Battery life , will last more than a day if under normal usage (Excluding Gaming and watching high resolution videos)
-> Sound quality is awesome
-> Netflix can render HD Quality videos
-> 64 Gb is enough for me , as im not into gaming on Tab
-> great for studies.
-> close to stock android (Compared with google Pixel), did not see any bloat wear other than those apps of Samsung.

Things which could have been better
-> Fast charging (takes more than an hour to fully charge -- close to 2 hours)
-> No Sim feature , hence no calling feature
-> its heavy
-> Bezels could have been more thinner
-> Screen quality is good , but not great when compared to smart phones. But in par with other Tabs in the price segment .
-> Camera quality is OK OK , in par with other tabs in the price segment.

No regrets after buying the Tab, Its fast enough and gets the job done. Happy with what Samsung has provided."

The e-ink screen is great, and I adore its design, its aesthetic. It's a pleasure to look at, just beautiful.

The writing experience is the best in the e-ink category.
Its e-ink so no eye strain, totally replaces paper for me.
It has no backlight, so using a portable book lamp.

This is a device that is focused on the philosophy of Focus.
This is no Kindle Scribe and there are very few features when compared to onyx boox tab series which is a proper android tablet with an e-ink screen. There are 13.3-inch e-ink devices as well. There are more than 10 brands making these kinds of e-ink devices.

My decision to choose this product was simply because the remarkable 2 has the best writing feel plus the incredible design.

This device is for those who want to avoid digital screens due to eye strain.
And devices such as these make Paper redundant in the digital age.

It's expensive but I have used my kindle extensively for more than a decade without any issues and makes Life incredibly convenient. No more heavy stacks of books and notebooks that I have to manage.; I bought this a few days ago. I am a writer and at any given time I have at least 4 notebooks with different things in it. This is extra confusing, because I suffer from ADHD. This e-notebook has replaced all my other books for taking notes, writing my novel and all of my lists — all in one place! It’s amazing!
But please understand that it will NOT replace your iPad/laptop or phone.
It has no apps and it’s almost solely for writing and sketching.
Yes you could read, but since it doesn’t support kindle but it will not replace your kindle/book reading electronic devices.
Cons:
- the edges gives out raggedy handwriting which is a bit annoying but I write away from it.
- the marker plus pen is heavy and I prefer lighter pens since I write a LOT and after a while, my hand starts cramping. You could use a different pen with the pen tips but I personally haven’t tried that yet.
- it’s black and white. With my physical notebook, I like to use coloured pens to add titles and subtitles. But I can’t with this device. You could use different writing formats like the marker and the calligraphy pen to make up for this but I personally would have liked a coloured screen.
- The folio doesn’t have a slot for the pen so when you close the folio flap, the pen that’s attached to the device sticks out and could easily fall and be lost.
- it’s touchscreen is rudimentary when compared to tablets so it’s slow clicks will take some getting used to.
- quick notes cannot be individually added into folders which is annoying. Only notebooks can. Also, the quick notes are all arranged in the same tab. So if I have one quick note and then at another time, I take another quick note, it won’t show up separately on the main files section. You have to click on the one tab for it and then choose the page from the menu tabs.

Note: these cons are annoying but NOT a deal breaker for me to replace my physical notebooks. I have replaced them all with the remarkable 2 and I have NO regrets!; Remarkable2 is an amazing product and with this e-ink technology one can save lot of papers.
I bought this for my husband who loves to write and he is in love with this product.
He can write notes with his handwriting using remarkable2 and it’s pen. Notes are easy to manage in different folders and search is quite easy.

I highly recommend this for people who loves to write during meetings, or casual talks with your own handwriting. There is so much comfort in writing and managing notes.; ; This tablet is amazing, like nothing I've ever seen before. Everyone who sees it, wants one. I really want the keyboard but it's hard to justify the price after spending this much. However, I'm sure it's worth it, just like this purchase was worth it.

I finally feel some sort of handle on my ADHD need for all the productivity items hahahaha; Recomendable; Entregado antes de lo agendado. Muy buen precio y servicio; The ReMarkable2 is making my life easier daily. I am still learning to use it and leverage the features it contains yet in a few short weeks it is making my work/side hustle/personal life easier. A few simple positives:
It is simplistic. It does one thing and it does it well.
It is distraction free.
Basic usage is intuitive.
Intermediate usage is pretty intuitive with a little guidance.
I still need to dive into training videos to become a power user.
I appreciated the packaging came in recyclable containers.
The ability to write, erase, and move text is super simple.
Organizing is easy once you understand the Folder/Notebook/Quick Sheets structure.

I spent 3 days in a seminar recently. I was able to download the PDF notebook (over 200 pages of documents) into my ReMarkable and then write my notes on the document. I will upload the document back to Dropbox to save/print off later. I had the option of writing my notes on the document or using a Layer (think clear sheet) that I could write on and turn the 2nd layer off if I wanted to see the main document without my notes. That wasn't an issue for me. Later, I did have one page with checklists I needed to use 3 times so I chose to use the Layers for each use and then remove them when I didn't need it anymore.

At work, I have a weekly meeting that traditionally has been one sheet of paper per week and then keeping up with each piece of paper as I needed to go back and review. With the Notebook feature, I now have those meeting notes going into one document that I will add to each week. It's easy to find and no lost pieces of paper. I also have a coaching practice and this allows me to keep notes on clients in one running document instead of multiples I must file and track.

Two things for the creators to consider - first, it would be easier to read downloaded documents with a lighter/color screen. That said, the existing screen didn't stop me from accomplishing what I wanted to accomplish. Second, a pen loop would be helpful as the magnetic pencil can come unattached. That said, placing the ReMarkable with the binder edge down and pencil on top in my bag helps.

I think I have now sold 6 of these to family and friends. At the recent conference there were a few of us who had the ReMarkable2 and we met during a break to share notes and unanimous enthusiasm for this tool.

It is fantastic.; Me ha gustado la interfaz, responde a la escritura como si fuera papel, práctica de tamaño y aunque un poquito pesada es adecuado para transporte.

Me permite fácilmente anotar y convertir a texto si deseo, la aplicación de mi lap y celular (macbook y iPhone) es muy buena, genial para presentar en zoom lo que escribes o haces diagramas, etc.

Bueno para organizar y he cargado algunos libros en PDF y ebook (no de kindle) para leer, la interfaz con power point y word es genial!!! te permite mandarlo a tu reMarkable en un click y ahí trabajarlo, hacer anotaciones, etc. y ya regresar a retrabajarlos después.

Ideal para tener un lugar sin distracciones, no sustituye un ipad y eso es bueno, ya que sustituye el montón de libretas, post it, etc. que tenía por todos lados.

En la relación costo - producto si la veo algo elevada de costo, no por mucho pero si la compraría de nuevo.

Batería buena duración, lo que tengo miedo es que no hay soporte para México para cuando termine mi suscripción anual, espero no tener problemas..."

M2 CPU (15%)> SD GEN2
SD GEN 2 (GPU) > M2 GPU

Real life performance experience I am telling that and benchmarks also both say something; Using this regularly from a week... best one; The display is gorgeous and huge compared to competition and the tab is extremely powerful. But like every other Samsung displays this doesn't support dolby vision. Hdr10+ works but many streaming platforms don't yet support you're relagated to hdr10 now. Anyway, it's still a joy to be able to watch your fav stuff lying on the bed.; The best android tablet. Fastest lightest.smoothest.; Stunning display,superfast operating system n solid armour aluminium based build quality...; Like 👍; As expected another gem from samsung
A True alpha of the tablet world; First impression was quite great. Display is outstanding
Sound is awesome
Selfie camera is better than rear camera
Fell in love with the size and overall display looks attractive at first glance
Cons:-
A bit heavier

-heavy, bigger display and uncomfortable during gaming"

So far, I am pleased with my purchase.

Pros:
Good battery life. After watching YouTube for hours and surfing the web, it lasts about a work day. Charges quickly on the docking speaker.

USI stylus comparability. Good for Keep Notes note taking, drawing, and as a ""mouse""

Pictures and videos are clear.

Docking speaker sounds good, and adds depth to music and video sound.

Operating software is only about 15 gigs, so far.

Easy to set up, and the Google accounts have synced across devices. The calendar widget is awesome!

Cons:
The cameras are lacking, but at 8 pm I'm not complaining.

While drawing (with stylus or with finger) there is a minute lag from touch point on the screen to the drawing portion. I've tried to adjust it, but can't figure out how or if I'm able to.

The pull up from the bottom of the screen to close open apps is a little slow, and sometimes doesn't register.

This isn't really a con, but is odd: most apps aren't made for tablets, so they show up as a bar/phone like display when in landscape mode. You can move this display from the left, middle or right, and use multiple apps in split screen mode. It does run a little slower then, but isn't a deal breaker for me.

Overall:
I got this on a lightning deal, and am pleased. I would purchase again if I had to on lightning deal. The Hub screen is not like Nest Hub- it shows media, weather, etc... and is customizable, but doesn't have all of the Nest Hub features. This tablet is a good tablet for media consumption and a little more. I

didn't receive the case I ordered with it, so cannot say anything about that.; I know, I know, you can get better specced tablets for less money. But this is a purge android experience (no junk or bloatware) and it comes with a dock. We had a lenovo google display in the kitchen but it is a piece of junk so we replaced it with this. This works as a google home, shows our photos when docked but can also be easily lifted off the base and used for recipes in the kitchen or anything else, anywhere else.
I got a deal on the tablet and case combined and I certainly recommend the combo. The tablet can be docked while still in the case and the case has a handy pop-out stand.
Recommend.; Before the Pixel Tablet, the tech felt like a chasm between my elderly parents and me. Sure, they had phones, but video calls could have been more better. Enter the Pixel Tablet with its charging speaker dock – a game-changer for tech and our relationship.

Simplicity, Amplified: The dock cradles the tablet, keeping it charged and ready for their ""Hey Google"" summons. There's no fumbling with cords or confusing menus – just a tap or a voice command, and they're connected. Suddenly, video calls became crystal clear, their faces beaming without lag. We could virtually tour their garden, share recipes, and even watch movies together, the sound booming from the dock like a mini home theater.

A Window to Their World: The tablet's interface is so intuitive even tech-timid parents like mine could navigate it. The large icons, clear text, and voice control empower them to explore independently. They discovered YouTube cooking tutorials, rediscovered old music, and even started playing simple games – their laughter echoing through the house, a sound I hadn't heard in years.

Safety Net Woven with Tech: The built-in smart home controls became their guardian angels. They were adjusting the thermostat, dimming the lights, and checking the front door camera – all from the comfort of their armchair. The fall detection feature gave me peace of mind, knowing they'd get help if needed.

More Than a Gadget, a Bridge: The Pixel Tablet transcended a mere device; it became a bridge. It brought us closer, sparking conversations about their favorite videos, the news, and memories. It's not just about tech; it's about connection, engagement, and a renewed sense of independence for them.
Imperfections Don't Dim the Shine: The battery life could be longer, and the app selection for seniors could be more comprehensive. But these are minor quibbles compared to the joy, the connection, and the sense of security this tablet has brought.

For anyone looking to bridge the tech gap with their elderly loved ones, look no further than the Pixel Tablet with its charging speaker dock. It's more than a screen; it's a doorway to a closer, more joyful relationship. And for that, it gets a perfect five stars from me and a grateful heart from my parents.; Looks and feels great. It serves as a tablet and a hub. Very impressed. Google quality."

With its sleek design and impressive features, this iPad is sure to be a popular choice for users of all types.; Very nice product and very useful for my day to day activities; Great product with everything as you would like it and more… the placement of the landscape camera is excellent…finally!

Two things you may wish to consider before buying:

1. So far I have been unable to use an external plug-in mic for certain apps, and this is really frustrating. With my wireless earbuds there is no problem, however I would prefer to have the better sound quality which my plug-in mic produces.

2. The Apple Pencil (1st iteration only) is compatible with this new iPad… HOWEVER… you must purchase (for Rs. 900 = approx $11 USD), a small plastic adaptor so that the Pencil can physically connect and pair with the iPad! Note that an adaptor was included with my Apple Pencil, HOWEVER, it is Lightning to Lightning, and to connect the Pencil to iPad 10 you must purchase the USB-C to Lightning adaptor. So even if you have what “seems” to be the correct adaptor, still, you are required to purchase the “correct” one. Thinking I would be able to pair my pencil with my new iPad I attempted to do so several times, (of course, in vain), only to think that perhaps the iPad had a defect. I called Amazon about this and they were not aware of this small but significant technical issue, and subsequently referred me to Apple directly. Before calling Apple and wasting their time as well as my own I discovered what the actual problem was / is, and I have ordered the correct adaptor directly from the Apple website itself. Nonetheless, here I sit with my shiny new iPad on the day it arrived with, (at least for the time being), a non-functional Apple Pencil. 😕

All of this totally unnecessary expense and botheration could have been easily avoided had Apple shipped the “correct” adaptor with the iPad, knowing that many users like me would encounter this aggravating problem. C’mon, Apple, this faux pas is quite slap dash!

Regardless, this is not enough to taint the 5 star rating I am maintaining for this overall excellent product.; ; It is smooth like butter with no lag.; I had no idea that it would be so easy to set it up. It’s easy to use but I still need to figure out certain things. Not sure if we can code using the device as I haven’t checked it yet. Overall I would highly recommend it. Thank you for the speed delivery! ☺️; Good product 👍🏻; the original apple box received damaged and dirty"

I use this daily and have no complaints.; I like it. Bought it for my wife. She will only use it to watch movies to pass away time on a plane, but it can do much more. I added an SSD card and installed some MP4 movies. Installed Hawaiian Air Lines App as well. Wish it was just as easy to to that on my Amazon fire. Easy to use and no problems.; A little slow loading during setup, but for this price I think that’s fine. Bought this as a birthday gift for my nephew to use with an apitor building kit. I haven’t heard any complaints from him and he uses it daily; Low battery life. Lasts 3 hours and then at least 8 hours to charge it.
Apps just go to a blank black screen and you have to exit out and pull it up again. And again. And again. Total waste of money.; Item arrived on time. It was packaged very well and so far is working as it should. Set up instructions were easy as well."

Thankfully Samsung has stepped up their game, which is a good thing for my peace of mind. I bought this tablet many many months ago for my mother, because her main use case include reading scripts from ancient apocrypha and watching the most obscure YouTube videos known to mankind. Honestly I'd go insane if I wade through the junk that accumulates on boomer communication devices. That being said you're not here to listen to me vent, so let's get to the point.

[Display] - 4/5
It's a 10.5 inch TFT panel that carries the exceptional Samsung display quality. There is no sAMOLED functionality, and honestly I wouldn't expect it for this kind of price. The resolution is 1920x1200 which is more than enough for consuming content on a screen of this size, this includes YouTube videos, games and books. That being said this display is quite excessive for boomers who will only use the tablet for reading, you can do better buy buying a tablet half the price.

I saw a few students asking if this tablet supports the S-Pen on forums, I tested it out and no S-Pen is not supported. But I did find a few videos and posts that show people using those capacitive stylus to take notes in S-Pen and do some art. Also there is no Dex available for this tablet so keep that in mind for those that are using the tablet for studies.

[Connectivity] - 5/5
It has wifi and Bluetooth, literally all you need for home use. The connections are snappy and I haven't faced any issues setting it up, my mom haven't faced any issues either, despite her claiming that Bluetooth will cause cancer...

[Performance and Storage] - 4/5
I mean I am only giving 4/5 because it looks more critical. I don't use this device to properly stress test i, I did try playing some games on it and it seemed pretty snappy, I didn't download PUBG because my mother isn't a budding eSports pro based in Noida. It has an ""Octa Core Processor"" which is mot probably based on Unisoc architecture(arguably less reliable than Exynos and Qualcomm but that doesn't matter for light users like boomers). The most action this tablet sees is when my mother uses the Facebook app. I bought the 4GB RAM and 64 GB storage version because it is more than enough for my mother, I might add a 128GB SD card just in case she decides to install WhatsApp on it. 4GB RAM is more than enough for almost all modern applications and use cases, sure in 2023 8GB is the norm, but the tablet has not slowed down even a bot for my mother. I honestly wouldn't recommend you but this tablet for gaming if that is your primary use case.

[Camera] - 3.5/5
This is the crux of the usage for boomers, an absolute make or break situation, and honestly this tablet passes with flying colors. The front camera is positioned on the side allowing your eyes and face to be centered in a video call while the tablet is in landscape mode. This is a big win, and honestly places the tablet leagues ahead of the competition which will make you look schizophrenic during video calls as your eyes dash from side to side away from the camera. The front facing camera is 5MP and Samsung's software does a good enough job to make sure the image quality is good, I tested out a video call with my mother and the quality was very good in mediocre lighting. The rear camera is 8MP and does a very good job in scanning documents and for the average boomer, provides a good enough picture quality for those emergency neighborhood landfill photos.

I would say this is also more than enough for students who require a table to attend their online classes, because the teach ain't going to care if you look like handsome squidward. All in all the cameras perform their function to the t.

[Software] - 5/5
As far as Android tablets go in terms of software, this is the best you're gonna get. The One UI is the best out there for both power users and for boomers, and it is the thing carrying these tablets forward even with the mediocre hardware. You can multitask easily, install all sort of apps, customize the appearance of the tablet as well as program unique gestures to make life easier for the boomers who'll be using this device. If the boomer you're buying this tablet for was using another android tablet or an iPad, then transitioning to this will be no problem at all. The UI is tailor made to be as user friendly as possible. I kid you not, my mother who barely knows how to use her phone from OnePlus, uses thus tablet effortlessly. Also in my humble opinion the software is well suited for students as well, with a full version of Samsung notes available with the tablet, and many other features like the device profiles that can be set up for focus, entertainment etc. This is a testament to Samsung's software engineers, UI, and UX designers. The software alone should be enough to warrant a purchase.

Depending on when you buy the tablet you will have One UI 5.1 and Android 13 as the latest versions of the software. Anything beyond that is questionable(there will be regular security updates till 2024).

[Battery] - 5/5
It packs a 7000mAh battery that can comfortably the day on a full charge. No problem on that end.

[Conclusion] - 4.5/5
For the boomer/middle schooler in your life, this is a perfect tablet. It'll perform the functions of everything they need while making sure that anything extra will be uncomfortable enough to not pursue. Wallet friendly and very well built. I would say go for it, but with 2023 ending I'm pretty sure they'll be an upgraded option for this tablet in 2024, considering this tablet's support cycle has ended. Though if software us not a problem then you really can't go wrong with this tablet.; I've been using the Samsung Tab A8 for the past few months, and I must say, Samsung has yet again proven itself as a trustworthy brand. This tablet, while not a powerhouse, impressively handles basic functions such as entertainment, light gaming, and file management.

Pros:
1. **Best UI Experience:** Samsung's One UI provides a smooth and user-friendly interface, making the tablet a joy to navigate.

2. **3 Years of Software Update Confirmation:** Samsung's commitment to providing software updates for three years ensures your device remains secure and up-to-date.

3. **Good File Management System and Knox Security:** The tablet excels in file management, and Samsung's Knox security adds an extra layer of protection.

4. **Big Display with Good Build Quality:** The tablet boasts a generous display and solid build quality, enhancing the overall user experience.

5. **Quad Speakers with Very Loud Sound:** The audio experience is excellent with four speakers that deliver loud and clear sound, perfect for entertainment and multimedia.

Cons:
1. *TFT Display Feels Washed Out:* While the display is sizable, the use of a TFT panel results in colors that may feel less vibrant compared to other display technologies.

2. *Slow Charging with Included Charger:* The tablet's bundled 7.5V charger, despite supporting 15V fast charging, extends the charging time to 3-4 hours, which can be a bit of a drawback.

3. *Heavier Than expected:* The tablet is on the heavier side, which may not be ideal for extended one-handed use or portability.

In conclusion, the Samsung Tab A8 is a reliable choice for those seeking a tablet for everyday tasks. It might not be a top-tier performer, but its well-rounded features, secure software support, and quality user interface make it a commendable option for users who prioritize trustworthiness and functionality over cutting-edge specifications.; Pros:
1. Screen size of 10”+ at this price point is a very Good point!
2. Performance is good!
3. The speakers are amazing!
4. Knox Security included
5. Enough detailing to the tab and it feels so premium in hand!
Cons:
1. Samsung could have got an AMOLED into this price…
2. S-pen support or stylus support lacks in this device!
3. Supports fast charging but gets a 8W charger out of the box, takes a healthy time to fill the juice!
One extra note : Kuddos to team samsung for the screen, I have used A7 and now A8 initially without any cover not a single bit of scratch I noticed in the screen! Build is top notch; What i like about A8
-> Its slim
-> Metallic finish
-> Looks premium
-> Its fast enough for me, able to play most of the games and look into my notes.
-> Popup feature and shortcuts are good.
-> Battery life , will last more than a day if under normal usage (Excluding Gaming and watching high resolution videos)
-> Sound quality is awesome
-> Netflix can render HD Quality videos
-> 64 Gb is enough for me , as im not into gaming on Tab
-> great for studies.
-> close to stock android (Compared with google Pixel), did not see any bloat wear other than those apps of Samsung.

Things which could have been better
-> Fast charging (takes more than an hour to fully charge -- close to 2 hours)
-> No Sim feature , hence no calling feature
-> its heavy
-> Bezels could have been more thinner
-> Screen quality is good , but not great when compared to smart phones. But in par with other Tabs in the price segment .
-> Camera quality is OK OK , in par with other tabs in the price segment.

No regrets after buying the Tab, Its fast enough and gets the job done. Happy with what Samsung has provided."

I hope you get the idea from it go for higher it will be more better than this and; This review is not for product but the delivery and return process of amazon. Ordered this tablet and found out that this one is not charging at all, so called the amazon customer support and they said 'no worries, get a diagnostic report from samsung service centre and with that certificate, return the product'. So i went to samsung care and the guys over there helped getting me the diagnostic report certificate named ""dead on arrival"" (DOA).

Now, i called the amazon customer support and they arranged pickup for return of tablet (with DOA certificate) and delivery of new tablet. And here comes the paradox... (Remember why i was returning the tablet? It wasn't charging, and so it was literally dead on battery)
The delivery guy says he needs to see the IMEI number on the device in the 'about device' menu on the battery dead tablet, i said it is impossible since the tablet won't start. He said 'then I can not complete the process' and left.

I again made a call to amazon customer service and the guy on the line said 'sir, you are our prime member, we'll have it sorted in 24 hrs' and again arranged the pickup + delivery.

Again the loop started, the delivery guy wanted the IMEI number on dead tablet and without that he wouldn't process the delivery of new tablet.
I was stuck in this paradox of showing IMEI number of the dead device by going to about section of device which needs it to get powered up first (that the tab obviously can't)

But this delivery guy was considerate enough, he said, let's try putting it on charge and even if I get pic of that 'about device' menu that shows the IMEI number, I'll process the return right away. My luck struck the right chord over there and i was able to switch the tablet on in the Nth attempt (10+ attempts were made to charge the device but it would just vibrate once and then proceed to blackout) it started and with 1% battery indicating in the corner i got the IMEI number on the screen from the device setting and the delivery guy took picture of it and then the tablet died.

I got the new tablet as replacement and it's working good.

So who's at fault here for this headache? Amazon customer service said that the tablet will be replaced just with certificate, delivery team was more interested in starting the dead tablet to verify the IMEI number... So I guess it's the communication between the amazon and it's delivery team.; Good product as expected; The tablets display is good. Average performance. Camera gets the work done with 10x zoom doing average. Memory is okay for multitasking. It is indeed the best for its price.; All functions are as expected. P99 processor at affordable price.; Convenient to use; After 10 days of usage the tab is restarting on its own. Now ai have to go to the service center which is 50kms away. Now I am doubting the products sild by Amazon.; J'adore cette tablette pas trop grosse juste parfaite je peux faire plusieurs choses en même temps plusieurs applications ouverte et aucun bogue.La caméra n'est pas fameuse mais bon On peut relié nos appels et messages textes de notre téléphone dessus. Le son est bon n'as pas de stylet par contre. Il se peut que vous ne réussissez pas à mettre Canada comme pays choisissez l'Australie et français ça ne change rien. Je suis surprise de sa rapidité et l'autonomie de batterie Samsung offre vraiment de la qualité à bon prix.; What I like..........Nice size, span a grip with one hand, easy carry. It will fly a DJI mini 2 drone. It will connect to an external HD. It does have an SD card slot and SIM card slot. And it has a real Samsung processor. Not many do. The only thing I noticed, it's not powerful enough to run Video editing software. But plays videos no problem.; Pros: Fast & smooth operation.

Cons: Texts appear blurry; eye protection mode doesn't work as intended; screen fails to register my touch 20% of the time.

Returned.; Replaced my Ipay 50 mini, which was starting to warp. This Samsung is a brand name you can't go wrong with. Built solid and lots of support to go with it.; acheter pour mon épouse qui a quelques problemes avec ses mains . donc elle est facile pour elle de la manipuler ,"

Am very much annoyed with this purchase, I bought this during Jan 2023 (6GB-128GB), within 10days the issue started.
This tablet is a good model only, however it has got an issue with its auto screen-locking, it will not allow you to use this table for even few minutes. I am tired of unlocking it, and sometimes it will lock while inputting the screen patter / password.
I tried my best to tweak it myself but not successful. And I was really surprised to see lot of users have posted about this issue in the Lenovo Forum, and the disappointing factor is that - it is not yet fixed even by the Lenovo support, they are simply giving some blah blah steps, change settings, check the lock button, reset factory settings etc, but there is no such update this issue has an solution.

Single star is given only due to the Locking Issue, and apart from this issue, this Tablet is a good device.

Pros:
1. Fast Charging.
2. Crystal Clear Display.
3. No Lagging.
4. Good Audio Quality.
5. Smooth Transition.
6. Good Battery Backup.
7. No Heating Issues.
8. Supports USB Audio Out.
9. Supports Stylus.
10. Fast Streaming (OTT Applications).

Cons:
1. AUTO SCREEN LOCKING within Few Seconds, cant use it for even less than a Minute.
2. Poor Camera Quality - both Front and Rear.

Thank You.

Edits: 28 Nov 2023.
Due to the frequent screen locking issues I visited the Lenevo Exclusive Service Centre. The Executive Mr. Parthiban without even opening the Tablet resolved the issue.
The Problem is not with this device, but with the Tablet Case with the Magnetic Lock. The Tab frequently locked due to the Magnetic Interference with the Sensor.
Now it's not locking by itself as I am using the Tab Case without bringing the Magnetic Lock into that Sensor.

Regarding the Camera clarity I got to know the in-app camera quality is average but if the camera is used as a stand alone then it's clarity is awesome.

This is a wonderful device and would recommend.

Thank You.; Very nice..I am using since last 1 year; Though not too fast , but moderate use is ok ok.
Does my work better and simplify.
Comfortable and portable device.
Network connectivity with LTE SIM & wifi are excellent 👌.
Justifies it's price .
Never let you regret for every penny.
Value for money 💰.
Definitely go for it. Recommended.; I bought the tablet through Amazon on 03 June 2024. It stopped working on 07 June within four days and now I have to run around to find service center. Worst Service of Amazon.; I still have it after 1 year; So far so good.; I will recommend Xiaomi or Samsung tabs; Nice product. Very effectively priced"

I have been waiting for Nexus 9 ever since it was announced in October. But it was never released in India untill late December. I have no clue why. Found it and ordered in Amazon.in. They delivered the product one day before the estimated time. The box contains the Nexus 9 Tablet WiFi 16GB version (I still havent found the product in any other websites. Google Play store still shows it as Coming Soon. I don't get it why), the USB cable and charger and initial startup instructions. Initially it took a while to start up after the updates and all. In the beginning few functions like camera were not working properly, for this I had to install the updates manually.
Almost a month of using the tab, I'm really happy with it. Works smooth, no major issues. Well, I haven't installed any big games or softwares to test its full potential though. Just few basic apps like BBC, Twilight, Reddit Is Fun, Book my show, Adobe reader, Moon+ reader, games like Quadropus, Smash Hit, Sky Force etc. They all working perfectly fine.
Built quality is incredible. You can feel the sturdy feel when you hold the tablet in your hands. The metallic rim around and the strong back panel gives it very strong feel. The screen is up to the marks. But not exactly a jaw dropping one. The PPI is lesser than that of Nexus 7 but more than Apple iPad Air 2. That's all. Could have been better.
The speakers are incredible too. Watching videos is a different experience all together. Few issues i have noticed are..
Heating up: whenever I browse for long or play games like Sky Force, the upper part of the tab at the rear side gets heated up.
Office Utility: I still haven't found a good Office ap where I can see slideshows and work with excel sheets smoothly. I have tried Google Slides (Crashes while playing large slideshows, Does not support many themes of PowerPoint), Polaris (Does not support notes of PowerPoint.), WPS Office Kingsoft (Does not support many themes of PowerPoint) and Office Suit 8 (way too many ads and pop-ups in free version.).
Multitasking is not up to the marks: For example viewing web pages offline. Once you load the page, go to another app and if you want to open that page again you will have to load it again.
Overall it is a great tablet for those who are looking for a serious office tablet and even multimedia lovers. I would recommend it to anyone hence 4 stars!; I bought this and its just awesome. The display is very nice It has good performance I had been an iPad user for the past 4 years . My iPad 4 let me down and I was so fed up with iOS that I decided to give Android a try . I wanted a tablet with a 4:3 aspect ratio . I decided not to buy Mipad because of its buggy software . I bought this and its just awesome . The display is very nice It has good battery life but takes about 5 hours to charge completely . Android Lollipop is nice and I updated it to v5.1.1 . Gaming is good and the boom sound front facing speakers are excellent . Rear camera is OK but front camera is not that good . Overall a good device
Thanks to HTC , Google and Amazon; I was waiting to purchase the Nexus from the past 2 years and finally succeeded to own one. However, I got a old one manufactured in Oct'14. I waited all these months to get the new batch of HTC N9 as many users posted screen, back cover and button issues; which were minimised in new batch.
Pros: The display is crisp and clear even at low brigthness. The stock android got updated to 5.0.1 and its good except the white background behind apps.The device heats up a lot while playing full HD videos, games. The battery backup is good and last for around 6-6.5 hours under continuous download and playing small game like angry bird transformer. Coming to cam , its good even under low light condition with the flash unlike old Nexus.the touch is smooth and good.coming to the audio quality, its awesome.I tried with jabra, sony, etc and the feel was good. we can hear the minute sound/beat/tone. In full volume, there was no distortion using speakers and had awesome stereo effect-the htc boomsound came into play. I wish it had 32 GB on board for wifi model. To add more, it supports OTG drives.So you can easily connect a 32gb otg though not tested with 64gb otg and hear music& watch videos. Have to try file transfer with NFC. Good for reading e-books
Cons : 1] Only 16GB onboard ;
2] No HEADSET from HTC.
3] No manual/service center list.
4] No screen guard.
5] Gets heated up quickly; Even though I got an old unit, Buttons and all are all ok. Screen is wonderful. Overall tablet feels light and excellently designed.

If only it had a better battery backup. I mean it needs a charging of 4-5 hours and then it gives me a juice of 15-16 hours.

I am a die hard google fan but when my wife uses her Ipad4 for 3 days without charging, it makes me envy her.

Another thing is build quality, its only ok.

What will it take for Google to understand that we need a PREMIUM product. Please Google listen!; Specs wise it's good. But HTC devices are buggy in general. And their customer service is pathetic.

It has one hardware issue which is a deal breaker. The graphics card after two months of use broke down. Tab starts to freeze at random with a blurring noise and has to be forced to restart and sometimes it lands in same situation. This is a well known issue and web search can lead to many related posts.

Amazon initially misled me to get a refund from HTC but later asked me to deal with HTC directly.

Finally I approached the HTC service center in Bangalore. And HTC service center is the worst of its kind. And I could see most of its latest model mobile phones run into issues at the service center. And it's staff are duping customers by returning devices after factory reset and without fixing. And they don't update device status on the customer support system to reflect accurate status.

I submitted my tablet on November 14 2015 and was finally returned to me returned as of 31 March 2016 after replacing the motherboard. Hence 4 months of warranty was spent at their service center.

And call center has no way to get status from back end team. There are no means to escalate the issue; I've been using Android tablets since the beginning. I've had a Motorola Xoom, an Asus Transformer Prime, a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 and now the Nexus 9. And I can comfortably say that the Nexus 9 is by far the best tablet I've ever had. Luckily, I received a unit which had only minimal backlight bleeding, which doesn't bother me even when watching movies.
The screen is superb. The colors aren't overly saturated and the color accuracy is spot on. Overall a very well calibrated display. While it doesn't have the 360ppi pixel density of my old TabPro 8.4, I can't really say that the difference is easily noticeable. It's definitely sharp enough at 289ppi (hey, the iPad can get away with having 265ppi).
The front facing speakers are amazing, especially if you're coming from a tablet with speakers on the side or back (pretty much all the others).
The build feels very solid, if not as high quality as the iPad. The metal on the sides and the soft, rubbery plastic on the back makes the tablet comfortable to hold, and makes for a simplistic design, but it doesn't feel cheap at all. The tablet feels dense, because of its large battery, but the long battery life sure makes up for the extra weight. By the way, I've been getting about one and a half days of medium to heavy usage (gaming, web browsing, watching videos on YouTube and Netflix, and some social networking).
As for performance, it's by far the fastest tablet I've ever head. Basic navigation is basically flawless, but it's still Android, so you will encounter a few hiccups when browsing the web or heavily multi-tasking, though these are rare enough not to be annoying. As for gaming, this thing is a beast. It can play any current game with excellent fluidity. Although be aware that it can get quite warm while playing the heaviest games (Sniper Fury made it get very warm after a while), and if you're on a warm country (it's summer here in São Paulo) you may experience some thermal throttling on the GPU occasionally (Sniper Fury was the only game I tested that could produce that result). In any case, this tablet is a beast for gaming, and the screen size and the front-facing speakers enhance the gaming experience even further.
Overall a great tablet, and possibly the best Android tablet out there. I'm really enjoying using it, and I hope other Android tablet manufacturers follow Google's and HTC's steps (considering the Galaxy Tab S2, they are). It's such a pleasure to use I've written this review entirely on it.
Definitely recommend it, but watch out because there are still some ""bad"" units being sold, which was not my case.; Wonderful tablet. It's very fast, performs very well.

I wasn't too sure about the screen, since it's only 2048x1536 and is 4:3 instead of 16:9 (e.g. ""full screen"" instead of ""widescreen""). I came from a 10"" tablet running 2560x1600, which is wide screen. However, the screen looks great. No issues here.

The performance is spectacular. It runs circles around every other device I have in all the real world use and benchmarks.

The software is stock Android. No surprises here. No goofy add-ons to slow things down, get in the way, or take up device space.

The size is much better than I thought. It's still large enough for a couple of people to watch a movie or show together when desired (e.g. on a plane, in a hotel room, whatever) but is far easier to hold than a 10"" tablet. Even going down to 8"" turns it into a much more solo device than the Nexus 9.

Speaking of watching movies... finally, a device with front facing speakers. I've always been astounded how many tablets and phones have speakers that are aimed away from your ears. The sound is great and you don't even have to get behind it or cup your hands around it to hear the sound well.

The storage, at 16GB, is low, but all of my movies and music are in the cloud and little else takes up much room. Sure, I can't load a dozen graphics-intensive games, but it can handle a few at a time and swapping them out is easy enough.

The cameras work, but I almost never use a tablet to take pictures.; My grandson was very happy to receive the tablet. He charged the tablet and within a few minutes he needed to recharge. He had to keep it plugged in.
I just learned this a few days ago. Can you send a new battery, this would be greatly appreciated. Or what options available to me.; Don't pay $399, buy it at the lower price of $349

Finally, Google has given us a great form factor for a Nexus tablet. The operating system has been refined to reflect Google's new philosophy of ""material design."" New adopters of this tablet who are used to the old versions of the OS may find that there is a bit of a learning curve in Android 5.0 ""Lollipop"" than in previous versions of the operating system. Holo Blue is gone and done away with and now we have something that appears to be brighter with less blacks and darks on app drawers and system screens. I found that the boot up time takes about 20 seconds from the time you power it on (Not sure if that is a point that anyone cares about but I figured I put it in my review for those interested).

I tend to find that my experiences on the Nexus 10 and the Nexus 7 running Android 4.4.4 was a better user experience. Not that there is anything wrong with the Nexus 9 user experience. It just may take awhile for people like myself who are new to the Android 5.0 to get used to its new design and layout. I did find that the OS has no lag or slow down effect when put through its paces. Its snappier when moving from app to app and I find that my videos and movies tend to download faster than on the previously mentioned devices.

The device also comes with two front facing speakers on the top and the bottom of the device, a welcome addition to smartphones and tablets as of late. When tilted to landscape mode, the sound coming from the speakers will give you a true stereo experience like the Nexus 10. I hope that front facing speakers for Nexus devices are here to stay, but I guess we will have to wait and see.

Now there is a metal edge all around the tablet but the back is just the usual soft plastic that previous Nexus devices have. I feel that the bezels on the top and the bottom of the device should have been smaller but I guess they did it that way to accommodate the speakers. I have would given the Nexus 9 a higher rating but the OS does not take advantage of all the screen the Nexus 9 has to offer. Hopefully this will be addressed in future OS updates, but again we will all have to wait and see. Also, there is no notification LED as the OS is supposed to give you updates on the screen as they come in.

My biggest gripe with this device is the price. Google Play store is selling the device for $399. The device does not have a higher resolution camera like the one you see on the Nexus 6. The Nexus 9 does not have a 4K or a QHD display. Also, it is not made of premium materials, like you would see on an all metal body device like an iPad. In my opinion there is no justification for the price being $399. That's why I bought it from here on Amazon for $349.

Of more important note, if you are going to purchase this device, DO NOT pay more than the $349 price that is being offered here at Amazon. Based on my experience with the device, I feel this device is not worth the $399 that Google is trying to sell this device for. I suppose you could save your money and put it towards a Nexus 6. However, if you really want to have a premium Nexus experience, on a tablet of this size, make sure you save yourself some money and buy it at the lower price point.

Again, don't pay $399, buy it at the lower price of $349.; First, the pros.
* Extremely high resolution screen, very crisp and clear colors.
* High performance, this thing is fast and seamlessly handles any app I throw at it.
* Android 5.0. So far I've had no issues and this version of Android is very polished. I have a Galaxy S6 (and owned other Android devices) and the interface was very intuitive and easy to get into.

Cons
* Coming from a 7 in tablet before, this almost seemed too big to wield sometimes. Maybe that's personal preference, but after using this, I'd go back to 7 in on my next tablet purchase.
* Poor battery life and long recharge time. Full recharge seems to take 5-6 hours, and the battery will not charge when used while plugged in. I seem to think there's a problem with standby, my old tablet generally would have the same battery life as the last time I put it down, this tablet seems to noticeably discharge if you set it down and come back to it the next day. Mine is WiFi only and it shouldn't really be running intensive apps that need to check in constantly, so I doubt it's something I'm doing.
* The screen scratched somehow 10 seconds after I got it. I did set it screen down at my desk at work, and it got an inch long scratch right in the middle of the screen. It has never scratched anywhere after that, but it's a minor annoyance. Most of the time I don't even notice the scratch, but my last tablet I had over a year and had no scratches, this thing was scratched by the time it was out of the box.

I have bought a stylus pen (ifrogz and cost me $10 at wal-mart) for touchscreens and that has helped immensely with the size of the device where it's sometimes difficult to reach all the way across the screen.

All in all, I'm happy with this thing, but it didn't blow me away. Finally I know I opted for the 16GB model because the prices are outrageous just for a bit more HDD space, but 16 GB is too small and I definitely have to manage apps and constantly delete things."

I have been waiting for Nexus 9 ever since it was announced in October. But it was never released in India untill late December. I have no clue why. Found it and ordered in Amazon.in. They delivered the product one day before the estimated time. The box contains the Nexus 9 Tablet WiFi 16GB version (I still havent found the product in any other websites. Google Play store still shows it as Coming Soon. I don't get it why), the USB cable and charger and initial startup instructions. Initially it took a while to start up after the updates and all. In the beginning few functions like camera were not working properly, for this I had to install the updates manually.
Almost a month of using the tab, I'm really happy with it. Works smooth, no major issues. Well, I haven't installed any big games or softwares to test its full potential though. Just few basic apps like BBC, Twilight, Reddit Is Fun, Book my show, Adobe reader, Moon+ reader, games like Quadropus, Smash Hit, Sky Force etc. They all working perfectly fine.
Built quality is incredible. You can feel the sturdy feel when you hold the tablet in your hands. The metallic rim around and the strong back panel gives it very strong feel. The screen is up to the marks. But not exactly a jaw dropping one. The PPI is lesser than that of Nexus 7 but more than Apple iPad Air 2. That's all. Could have been better.
The speakers are incredible too. Watching videos is a different experience all together. Few issues i have noticed are..
Heating up: whenever I browse for long or play games like Sky Force, the upper part of the tab at the rear side gets heated up.
Office Utility: I still haven't found a good Office ap where I can see slideshows and work with excel sheets smoothly. I have tried Google Slides (Crashes while playing large slideshows, Does not support many themes of PowerPoint), Polaris (Does not support notes of PowerPoint.), WPS Office Kingsoft (Does not support many themes of PowerPoint) and Office Suit 8 (way too many ads and pop-ups in free version.).
Multitasking is not up to the marks: For example viewing web pages offline. Once you load the page, go to another app and if you want to open that page again you will have to load it again.
Overall it is a great tablet for those who are looking for a serious office tablet and even multimedia lovers. I would recommend it to anyone hence 4 stars!; I bought this and its just awesome. The display is very nice It has good performance I had been an iPad user for the past 4 years . My iPad 4 let me down and I was so fed up with iOS that I decided to give Android a try . I wanted a tablet with a 4:3 aspect ratio . I decided not to buy Mipad because of its buggy software . I bought this and its just awesome . The display is very nice It has good battery life but takes about 5 hours to charge completely . Android Lollipop is nice and I updated it to v5.1.1 . Gaming is good and the boom sound front facing speakers are excellent . Rear camera is OK but front camera is not that good . Overall a good device
Thanks to HTC , Google and Amazon; I was waiting to purchase the Nexus from the past 2 years and finally succeeded to own one. However, I got a old one manufactured in Oct'14. I waited all these months to get the new batch of HTC N9 as many users posted screen, back cover and button issues; which were minimised in new batch.
Pros: The display is crisp and clear even at low brigthness. The stock android got updated to 5.0.1 and its good except the white background behind apps.The device heats up a lot while playing full HD videos, games. The battery backup is good and last for around 6-6.5 hours under continuous download and playing small game like angry bird transformer. Coming to cam , its good even under low light condition with the flash unlike old Nexus.the touch is smooth and good.coming to the audio quality, its awesome.I tried with jabra, sony, etc and the feel was good. we can hear the minute sound/beat/tone. In full volume, there was no distortion using speakers and had awesome stereo effect-the htc boomsound came into play. I wish it had 32 GB on board for wifi model. To add more, it supports OTG drives.So you can easily connect a 32gb otg though not tested with 64gb otg and hear music& watch videos. Have to try file transfer with NFC. Good for reading e-books
Cons : 1] Only 16GB onboard ;
2] No HEADSET from HTC.
3] No manual/service center list.
4] No screen guard.
5] Gets heated up quickly; Even though I got an old unit, Buttons and all are all ok. Screen is wonderful. Overall tablet feels light and excellently designed.

If only it had a better battery backup. I mean it needs a charging of 4-5 hours and then it gives me a juice of 15-16 hours.

I am a die hard google fan but when my wife uses her Ipad4 for 3 days without charging, it makes me envy her.

Another thing is build quality, its only ok.

What will it take for Google to understand that we need a PREMIUM product. Please Google listen!; Specs wise it's good. But HTC devices are buggy in general. And their customer service is pathetic.

It has one hardware issue which is a deal breaker. The graphics card after two months of use broke down. Tab starts to freeze at random with a blurring noise and has to be forced to restart and sometimes it lands in same situation. This is a well known issue and web search can lead to many related posts.

Amazon initially misled me to get a refund from HTC but later asked me to deal with HTC directly.

Finally I approached the HTC service center in Bangalore. And HTC service center is the worst of its kind. And I could see most of its latest model mobile phones run into issues at the service center. And it's staff are duping customers by returning devices after factory reset and without fixing. And they don't update device status on the customer support system to reflect accurate status.

I submitted my tablet on November 14 2015 and was finally returned to me returned as of 31 March 2016 after replacing the motherboard. Hence 4 months of warranty was spent at their service center.

And call center has no way to get status from back end team. There are no means to escalate the issue; I've been using Android tablets since the beginning. I've had a Motorola Xoom, an Asus Transformer Prime, a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 and now the Nexus 9. And I can comfortably say that the Nexus 9 is by far the best tablet I've ever had. Luckily, I received a unit which had only minimal backlight bleeding, which doesn't bother me even when watching movies.
The screen is superb. The colors aren't overly saturated and the color accuracy is spot on. Overall a very well calibrated display. While it doesn't have the 360ppi pixel density of my old TabPro 8.4, I can't really say that the difference is easily noticeable. It's definitely sharp enough at 289ppi (hey, the iPad can get away with having 265ppi).
The front facing speakers are amazing, especially if you're coming from a tablet with speakers on the side or back (pretty much all the others).
The build feels very solid, if not as high quality as the iPad. The metal on the sides and the soft, rubbery plastic on the back makes the tablet comfortable to hold, and makes for a simplistic design, but it doesn't feel cheap at all. The tablet feels dense, because of its large battery, but the long battery life sure makes up for the extra weight. By the way, I've been getting about one and a half days of medium to heavy usage (gaming, web browsing, watching videos on YouTube and Netflix, and some social networking).
As for performance, it's by far the fastest tablet I've ever head. Basic navigation is basically flawless, but it's still Android, so you will encounter a few hiccups when browsing the web or heavily multi-tasking, though these are rare enough not to be annoying. As for gaming, this thing is a beast. It can play any current game with excellent fluidity. Although be aware that it can get quite warm while playing the heaviest games (Sniper Fury made it get very warm after a while), and if you're on a warm country (it's summer here in São Paulo) you may experience some thermal throttling on the GPU occasionally (Sniper Fury was the only game I tested that could produce that result). In any case, this tablet is a beast for gaming, and the screen size and the front-facing speakers enhance the gaming experience even further.
Overall a great tablet, and possibly the best Android tablet out there. I'm really enjoying using it, and I hope other Android tablet manufacturers follow Google's and HTC's steps (considering the Galaxy Tab S2, they are). It's such a pleasure to use I've written this review entirely on it.
Definitely recommend it, but watch out because there are still some ""bad"" units being sold, which was not my case.; Wonderful tablet. It's very fast, performs very well.

I wasn't too sure about the screen, since it's only 2048x1536 and is 4:3 instead of 16:9 (e.g. ""full screen"" instead of ""widescreen""). I came from a 10"" tablet running 2560x1600, which is wide screen. However, the screen looks great. No issues here.

The performance is spectacular. It runs circles around every other device I have in all the real world use and benchmarks.

The software is stock Android. No surprises here. No goofy add-ons to slow things down, get in the way, or take up device space.

The size is much better than I thought. It's still large enough for a couple of people to watch a movie or show together when desired (e.g. on a plane, in a hotel room, whatever) but is far easier to hold than a 10"" tablet. Even going down to 8"" turns it into a much more solo device than the Nexus 9.

Speaking of watching movies... finally, a device with front facing speakers. I've always been astounded how many tablets and phones have speakers that are aimed away from your ears. The sound is great and you don't even have to get behind it or cup your hands around it to hear the sound well.

The storage, at 16GB, is low, but all of my movies and music are in the cloud and little else takes up much room. Sure, I can't load a dozen graphics-intensive games, but it can handle a few at a time and swapping them out is easy enough.

The cameras work, but I almost never use a tablet to take pictures.; My grandson was very happy to receive the tablet. He charged the tablet and within a few minutes he needed to recharge. He had to keep it plugged in.
I just learned this a few days ago. Can you send a new battery, this would be greatly appreciated. Or what options available to me.; Don't pay $399, buy it at the lower price of $349

Finally, Google has given us a great form factor for a Nexus tablet. The operating system has been refined to reflect Google's new philosophy of ""material design."" New adopters of this tablet who are used to the old versions of the OS may find that there is a bit of a learning curve in Android 5.0 ""Lollipop"" than in previous versions of the operating system. Holo Blue is gone and done away with and now we have something that appears to be brighter with less blacks and darks on app drawers and system screens. I found that the boot up time takes about 20 seconds from the time you power it on (Not sure if that is a point that anyone cares about but I figured I put it in my review for those interested).

I tend to find that my experiences on the Nexus 10 and the Nexus 7 running Android 4.4.4 was a better user experience. Not that there is anything wrong with the Nexus 9 user experience. It just may take awhile for people like myself who are new to the Android 5.0 to get used to its new design and layout. I did find that the OS has no lag or slow down effect when put through its paces. Its snappier when moving from app to app and I find that my videos and movies tend to download faster than on the previously mentioned devices.

The device also comes with two front facing speakers on the top and the bottom of the device, a welcome addition to smartphones and tablets as of late. When tilted to landscape mode, the sound coming from the speakers will give you a true stereo experience like the Nexus 10. I hope that front facing speakers for Nexus devices are here to stay, but I guess we will have to wait and see.

Now there is a metal edge all around the tablet but the back is just the usual soft plastic that previous Nexus devices have. I feel that the bezels on the top and the bottom of the device should have been smaller but I guess they did it that way to accommodate the speakers. I have would given the Nexus 9 a higher rating but the OS does not take advantage of all the screen the Nexus 9 has to offer. Hopefully this will be addressed in future OS updates, but again we will all have to wait and see. Also, there is no notification LED as the OS is supposed to give you updates on the screen as they come in.

My biggest gripe with this device is the price. Google Play store is selling the device for $399. The device does not have a higher resolution camera like the one you see on the Nexus 6. The Nexus 9 does not have a 4K or a QHD display. Also, it is not made of premium materials, like you would see on an all metal body device like an iPad. In my opinion there is no justification for the price being $399. That's why I bought it from here on Amazon for $349.

Of more important note, if you are going to purchase this device, DO NOT pay more than the $349 price that is being offered here at Amazon. Based on my experience with the device, I feel this device is not worth the $399 that Google is trying to sell this device for. I suppose you could save your money and put it towards a Nexus 6. However, if you really want to have a premium Nexus experience, on a tablet of this size, make sure you save yourself some money and buy it at the lower price point.

Again, don't pay $399, buy it at the lower price of $349.; First, the pros.
* Extremely high resolution screen, very crisp and clear colors.
* High performance, this thing is fast and seamlessly handles any app I throw at it.
* Android 5.0. So far I've had no issues and this version of Android is very polished. I have a Galaxy S6 (and owned other Android devices) and the interface was very intuitive and easy to get into.

Cons
* Coming from a 7 in tablet before, this almost seemed too big to wield sometimes. Maybe that's personal preference, but after using this, I'd go back to 7 in on my next tablet purchase.
* Poor battery life and long recharge time. Full recharge seems to take 5-6 hours, and the battery will not charge when used while plugged in. I seem to think there's a problem with standby, my old tablet generally would have the same battery life as the last time I put it down, this tablet seems to noticeably discharge if you set it down and come back to it the next day. Mine is WiFi only and it shouldn't really be running intensive apps that need to check in constantly, so I doubt it's something I'm doing.
* The screen scratched somehow 10 seconds after I got it. I did set it screen down at my desk at work, and it got an inch long scratch right in the middle of the screen. It has never scratched anywhere after that, but it's a minor annoyance. Most of the time I don't even notice the scratch, but my last tablet I had over a year and had no scratches, this thing was scratched by the time it was out of the box.

I have bought a stylus pen (ifrogz and cost me $10 at wal-mart) for touchscreens and that has helped immensely with the size of the device where it's sometimes difficult to reach all the way across the screen.

All in all, I'm happy with this thing, but it didn't blow me away. Finally I know I opted for the 16GB model because the prices are outrageous just for a bit more HDD space, but 16 GB is too small and I definitely have to manage apps and constantly delete things."

(My daughter is also autistic). Finding a suitable replacement was hard since there is so many options out there. I came across this one because it had pretty great reviews in all aspects I was looking for in a replacement tablet.
Currently I’ve had this tablet for about 4 months before this one finally met its fate. Not entirely sure how my littles broke this one, for it happened sometime during the night when she had woken up. I contacted customer service and with a fairly speedy response they said they will replace the tablet for me. Though man made damage isn’t typically covered under warranty they said they will make an exception this time and get the replacement out to me in about 6 days.
Overall the tablet has held up pretty well for being an off brand. The case is really nice, foam cushion that absorbs drops. It comes with 2 screen protectors. The screen protectors are kind of meh to be honest, more like a thin film so when I get the replacement I will be looking for a better more tempered glass type for better screen protection. Other than that, the tablet was fairly easy to set up for my daughter. It has a fast processing system/ system memory so it didn’t lag upon use. The battery life lasts a long time even at half charge and given to her for bedtime/ night use. Comes with a bunch of kid friendly apps for all sorts of entertainment, though we mostly used it for YouTube kids and she was able to navigate through and pick what she wanted to watch easily.
So if you’re looking for a tablet that doesn’t break the bank and have a young child, I would highly recommend this one. Also at the time of purchase, I was on a tight budget brings it was just my daughter’s birthday and Christmas around the corner.
Thank you team Aocwei for your outstanding support and service! You are very much appreciated by this mama and will make little child smile once again!; This is a great tablet! We bought at Christmastime and we have said all year that it was the best gift to get our kids. We use them all the time for traveling--which we do a lot as a military family.

The tablet is pretty lightweight but sturdy, easy to use, charges pretty quickly with a great battery life, and is very user friendly. We had no issue connecting to any networks. The kids also enjoyed creating their own personal animated characters. The case comes with and is durable, cute, and has a built-in rotating stand they can also use to carry.

The company is also very friendly, quickly responsive, and SO helpful with issues! We will keep purchasing items from this company in the future, for sure!; I got this tablet for my 5 year old daughter, because she lost her fire hd tablet. So far she has enjoyed it. It comes with screen protector and case already on, so I love that. She loves the stand, the size, adding apps and I can see it all. Make sure to make your kids an email address to use on it. Family connection is awesome. A lot of storage space and it connects to my Hotspot for traveling and wifi just fine. I will be purchasing a second one very soon. My son has 2 tablet, but he is loving this one just as much, so purchasing really soon. He is 3 right now and can use it better than me... I haven't tried other things, so I'll do another review at a later date. Enjoy it's very nice...; I purchase 2 of these tablets for my Irish twins for Christmas 2024. Within a month one of the had to be replaced because the back became stuck to the case when trying to take it off to install the thin plastic ""screen protector"". When the tablet separated itself the screen also broke. We ordered a replacement as it had been under 30 days since purchase. We received the replacement one and within 6 weeks that new tablets screen shattered and was unusable due to falling from couch to carpeted floor. I have the warranty and even with the warranty I had to go back and forth arguing with them to send a repayment. I wasn't until I agreed to write a positive review that they agreed to send a new tablet. Why on earth would I write a good review when in 3 months we had to request 2 replacements due to poor quality case that 100% isnt shock proof? Anyways, I waited it out thinking maybe this one won't be so easy to break. I was wrong. The screen on the 3rd tablet is now spicer veining on one side. It did not drop or fall. It was charging. Son went to unplug it and noticed it's cracked. However, it's not even on the surface. It's deeper and now that side of his screen can't be used. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED 😞. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU NEED THE CASE TO PROTECT IT FROM ACCIDENTS.; This AOCWEI X700 tablet is THE ONE!

Originally we thought we'd try the kids fire tablet - after a couple days of fumbling around and not being able to control what our kids interacted with, as well as not being able to find their favorite characters and entertainment, we returned them.

Immediately upon opening the AOCWEI X700, setup for 'google family link app' and 'kids space' was very intuitive; both offering powerful yet simple parental controls. Being an android family already using a google family, with just a few setup questions we were off to the races. Our kids school app works flawlessly. The tablet speed is fast and screen is not laggy/glitchy to touches from even little fingers. Battery life is great and can entertain for LONG road trips or last a week with only daily learning activities. Recharges fast on standard USB-C. Lastly, the convenient kickstand/handle on the protective case is great for setting or attaching this tablet just about anywhere.

We've now purchased two of these for our kids and have recommended them to friends who were also frustrated with the other offerings and VERY happy with these. Great alternative for the google/android crowd."
