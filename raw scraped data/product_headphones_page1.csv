1. Comfort- the cushions are smooth and perfect. You can listen to long hours without any discomfort
2. Build quality is good for this price range. These aren't too hard on ear too
3. Sound quality is very good. You can expect that from skullcandy. Tones are good. Bass is not very high but enough for a normal listener. If you are a bass lover, then that's some drop for you.
4. Sound quality is more better with the aux connected as is the case with all other wireless headphones
4. Charging 10 min give upto 1hr 30min of listening time. Good for taking and making calls
Cons: 1. I think the audio volume is not great. You can't hear it loud enough till you increase it to more than 70%
2. No noise cancellation but upto 60% of the noise is impeded by the on ear cushions. You can't expect more noise cancellation at this price.

Overall, a great purchase. Highly recommended at this price range. Don't doubt. You can go for it; Earlier I was using Sony MDR XB450 and tried JBL tune 500Bt. JBL was not at all comfortable so I returned it. So I tried üíÄ. This Headphones are the best compared to both. Bass is just Perfect. Cushions are very comfortable. You can use it for 3-4 hours easily without any pain on ears. Skullcandy will never let you down. If you are confused then go for it.; I purchased it one year before, July 2021, now it is Sept 2022. What I liked about this product is the battery. But what is the use if the exterior gets random cracks? There are cracks forming around the headset and apparently the bass has also gone worse. Do you want a product that goes well just for a year or you want to buy something that lasts longer? I used to have Sony, was good but the cushion was poor. I opted for Skullcandy for an upgrade but I think I rather go back to Sony.; I do strength training mostly, and some running. Never fallen off once. Do get a bit hot due to on ear design.

These are perfect for when u need that bass to slap you like your dad when he sees your math grades.
11/10.

p.s not for casual listening, when u can actually hear the rest of the music its quite muddy, unless you lower the bass on EQ; I recently purchased the Skullcandy Cassette Wireless On-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black) from the Amazon.in app, and I must say that I am quite impressed with the sound quality and bass experience they offer. The headphones provide an immersive audio experience, allowing me to enjoy my favorite music, movies, and games with exceptional clarity and depth. The sound reproduction is crisp, and the bass is powerful, adding an extra dimension to my audio.

The build quality of the product is impressive when you first purchase it. The materials used feel sturdy and durable, giving a premium look and feel to the headphones. The cushioned ear cups provide a comfortable fit, allowing for extended listening sessions without any discomfort.

However, after approximately a year of use, I did notice some issues with the durability of the product. The sponge padding on the headphones started to tear, which was quite disappointing. I initially thought it might have been due to sweat, but considering that the headphones are advertised as water-resistant, I expected them to withstand such conditions. This made me question the practicality and true effectiveness of their water-resistant claims.

Overall, I would still recommend the Skullcandy Cassette Wireless On-Ear Headphones for those seeking the best sound quality and bass experience. However, it's important to note that the durability may be a concern after a year of use. If you decide to purchase this product, I would advise being mindful of the potential wear and tear on the sponge padding. It is crucial to manage your expectations and understand that the headphones may not hold up as well over time.; Sound quality is average and at full volume it can also be used as a speaker from headset its loud without any quality at full volume if u listen at low volume its good . comfort level is really low if you wear this for more than 30 mins your ears will start paining . Overall I dont suggest anyone to buy this headset .; I have been used many headphone of different brands such as bose jbl etc but i found this headphone the best i bougth it for rs 2600 and i have been using it from 4.5 years and they are still look like new and have the sound quality and comfort same as when it was new i prefer you to buy this; Si lo tuyo es subir el volumen al m√°ximo, estos audifonos son ideales, sonido con mucho poder y gran calidad en el bajeo, SONIDO POTENTE!
Adem√°s de ser comodos y ligeros, excelente opci√≥n!; I've been getting this brand for years and they never disappoint! Great headphones with great sound! Amazing price and good value. Charges easily and quickly and hours of use!; Update, love the sound and comfort with these headphones but they all break the same according to the other reviews. I purchased a second pair that came broken in the same way the other pair I ordered from here broke. üòì
Beneath is my old review. I would suggest spending more. I got lucky with that one pair I raved about below.
The plastic is very low grade and it will break in the same place even if you‚Äôre gentle

OLD REVIEW
I adore these headphones. I wear them just about every single day and at the gym. They stay on, are comfortable (padding at the top of your head) the sound quality for $40 cannot be beat, very decent.
These are under $40 and have a great connectivity. Sometimes I charge my phone in a room while I‚Äôm in the kitchen and it remains connected!

In the gym I get highly sweaty and they work beautifully and have held up to being sanitized every day.
I‚Äôve accidentally stepped on them and crushed them as well as throwing them in my bag and wearing them in rain storms (multiple times).
I am irresponsible with them üòÇ they‚Äôve held up. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing that but if you do they‚Äôll most likely survive.
I‚Äôve spilled coffee on them etc. you name it.

They have small cracks at the sides due to my negligence that are hardly noticeable.
Charging is fairly quick.

I would strongly recommend them.

Love the pricing, the quality and I feel they‚Äôll be great for another 2 years or so. Once they‚Äôre done I can see myself returning for another pair or having them repaired. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

If you‚Äôre seeking something cheap, cheerful and reliable; these will get the job done!

Also, I‚Äôve worn them for crazy long hours at a time and have never once had them die on me? üòÇ I charge them at the end of each night as I use them daily.; Scoperte a Stansted ma non avevo tempo di acquistarle. Ne ho prese due paia (una per me e una per mia figlia). Sono cuffie fenomenali, gran resa nei bassi, il suono √® bello corposone. Un po' scarso il microfono per le telefonate, ma uno le cuffie per prende per ascoltare la musica (il thrash metal esce da Dio; When using it on my Samsung TV, the minimum volume is too loud.
I would like to push the volume down, just to protect my ear (but that is not possible)."

Overall very good product in this price range.Very happy with this purchase.; Would like to give it a rating of 4 out of 5. Here's why:

Sound Quality (4/5)
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
The headphone delivers great audio with a certain level of bass. However the vocals in the music are suppressed to a extent.

Comfort (4/5)
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Fits great due to its adjustable band and cushions. However, it causes ear pain after some time of use.

Build Quality (4/5)
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
It possesses a sturdy build but the quality of the adjustable band may be a concern.

Battery Life (5/5)
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Is amazing and according to the products description. Can easily last a week with moderate use.

Mic Quality (3/5)
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Is of mediocre quality. Not very good.

Noise Cancellation (3/5)
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
External sounds can be heard with ease in this on-ear headphone.

Final Remarks: It is a decent product as a whole within this price segment and can give you a commendable experience.; I recently purchased the boAt Rockerz 450 Bluetooth On-Ear Headphones, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed with the overall experience.

Firstly, let's talk about the packaging - it's sleek and well-designed, setting the stage for what's to come. Setting up the headphones was a breeze; connecting to Bluetooth was as simple as a few taps on my device, and I was ready to go in no time.

Now, onto the sound quality - it's fantastic. The 40mm drivers deliver crisp, clear audio across a range of frequencies, making for an immersive listening experience. Whether I'm enjoying music, watching videos, or taking calls, the sound is consistently top-notch.

Speaking of calls, the integrated mic performs admirably. It captures my voice clearly, ensuring smooth communication without any hiccups. And being wireless, I appreciate the freedom it offers - no tangled cords or restricted movements.

Design-wise, the boAt Rockerz 450 doesn't disappoint. The luscious black color scheme exudes sophistication, while the padded ear cushions provide comfort even during extended use. It's a stylish accessory that complements any outfit or setting.

Battery life is another highlight. Straight out of the box, the headphones were fully charged, ready to deliver up to 15 hours of playback on a single charge. The charging process is straightforward, ensuring that I'm never caught off guard by a dead battery.

Overall, the boAt Rockerz 450 Bluetooth On-Ear Headphones exceed expectations on all fronts. With impressive sound quality, convenient wireless connectivity, and a sleek design, they're a must-have for any music lover or tech enthusiast. Whether you're using them with your PC or on the go, these headphones deliver an exceptional audio experience that's hard to beat. Highly recommended.; At this price this is a very good purchase.
The biggest pros is its sound qaulity is amazing
And the biggest con is the fitting of the headphone is such that both earpieces are pushing my both ears towards center. The fitting is thumbs down but still a good purchase.; The boAt Rockerz line is boAt's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.

1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.
2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.
3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.
5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.
4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?

As an avid audio enthusiast, I recently explored the capabilities of these earphones. This review delves into the design, comfort, sound quality, and overall performance of the JBL C100SI.

Design and Construction Quality:
The JBL C100SI showcases an elegant, understated design that radiates sophistication. Constructed from durable materials, these earphones blend longevity with a premium touch. The ergonomic design of the ear tips ensures a comfortable and secure fit, ideal for prolonged usage without causing any discomfort. The tangle-free flat cable, a practical addition, minimizes the hassle of dealing with knotted wires. Overall, the build quality mirrors JBL's commitment to combining style with resilience.

Comfort:
Comfort during prolonged use is paramount, and the JBL C100SI excels in this aspect. The inclusion of three different-sized ear tips in the package allows users to tailor the fit to their ear size, ensuring a snug and secure seal. The lightweight design makes these earphones a suitable choice for extended listening sessions, be it during commutes, workouts, or leisure time at home.

Audio Quality:
The JBL C100SI lives up to its promise of Pure Bass Sound, a standout feature that elevates the auditory experience. The bass response is robust and profound, adding a layer of depth to the music. Importantly, it doesn't overshadow the mid and high ranges, maintaining a balanced audio profile. Whether you prefer pulsating beats or intricate melodies, these earphones deliver a versatile audio experience across various music genres.

The effective noise isolation provided by the well-fitted ear tips enhances the overall audio quality by blocking out ambient noise, allowing users to fully immerse themselves in their music or phone calls. The microphone's clarity during calls ensures accurate transmission of your voice without interference.

One-Button Multi-Function Control:
The incorporation of a one-button control adds to the user-friendly design of these earphones. The single multifunction button enables easy play/pause, call answering/ending, and track skipping. The intuitive layout ensures seamless navigation through audio playback or call management without struggling with your device.

Conclusion:
In summary, the JBL C100SI In-Ear Headphones with Mic offer an outstanding audio experience, combining elegance, comfort, and impressive sound quality. Whether you're a bass aficionado or someone appreciating a well-rounded audio profile, these earphones deliver on JBL's commitment to Pure Bass Sound. The convenience of the one-button multi-function control makes them a practical choice for everyday use. At their price range, the JBL C100SI emerges as a compelling option for those seeking reliable, high-quality in-ear headphones.; BUT...>>>>>
Let‚Äôs know about its DURABILITY according to me when using this daily with care. So according to me this product is not durable at all in terms of its poor quality rubber material based CABLE which usually always tends to get tangled and wears out really fast when kept in a bag or a pouch and hence as time goes by it leads to affecting its performance in many ways in the long run and so my review is based on one of the major issues that i faced and so this is how it started..........
So first of all AMAZON is not at all blamed for the fault of this product as they packaged it well and delivered it on time before the expected delivery date and i am completely satisfied with AMAZON & it‚Äôs SERVICES!!!!!
And so it‚Äôs the company that did not design this product to last for more than a year or less than that!!!!!!!!

Anyway I Bought this product on Amazon in the MONTH of OCTOBER in the YEAR 2019 and everything went smooth after opening the package as I enjoyed this pair of earphones so much so that I did not realize that it's cable design, durability and built quality was really poor and hence I kept on using it and it never failed on me and always worked well but all of a sudden in the MONTH of MARCH in the YEAR 2020 which is two months from when i posted my review about this product, i had a major issue and it was that the right earphone all of a sudden stopped working out of nowhere while listening to music one day and later it was discovered by me that it would only work if I keep moving the top cable of the right earphone which is attached the 1 Button Remote With The Microphone and so it would start working and stop working as soon as I let go of the cable and this means that there was some loose connection between the Button Remote and the cable which should not happen as it cost a lot of money and jBL is well known company and they have outstanding products with fairly good prices compared to BOSE which is better but really highly overpriced. So currently I will call jBL CUSTOMER CARE and ask them to resolve the issue by either repairing my earphones or if not repairable that replace it with a new one as its still under its WARRANTY PERIOD!!!!!
So I will put an update as soon as I‚Äôm done solving my issue!!!!!

FINAL VERDICT: IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET WHICH IS BELOW RS 600/- or BELOW RS 700/-
THEN!!!!!
AND ONCE AGAIN ONLY THEN!!!!! GO FOR THIS PRODUCT AS IT‚ÄôS A GREAT PAIR OF EARPHONES UNDER YOUR BUDGET AT A HUGE DISCOUNTED PRICE!!!!!
BUT IF YOU BUDGET IS BELOW RS 1000/- AND YOU LOVE jBL SIGNATURE SOUND THEN GO FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE THE TANGLE FREE CABLE AS THEY WILL DEFINITELY LAST LONGER AS IN MORE THAN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND NOT GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT :)

AND SO GUYS I WOULD RECOMMEND WHENEVER YOU PURCHASE ANY PAIR OF EARPHONES OF ANY KIND OF COMPANY PLEASE DO BUY THE ONES WITH THE TANGLE-FREE CABLE AS I HAVE A PAIR of HEADPHONES WITH A TANGLE-FREE CABLE AND IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 3 YEARS BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO IT AT ALL AND IT STILL WORKS WELL.

SO GO AND GET SOME GOOD PAIR OF EARPHONES if needed AT A VERY GOOD PRICE ON Amazon.in
AS THEY USUALLY PROVIDE GOOD AFTER SALE SERVICES ACCORDING TO ME!!!!!!!!!!

Thanks to all of you who read and understand my review.

6. Audio Quality is great - Very balanced instead of fancy stuff like Bass boosted, etc. Thus giving user the control to equalize their songs.

7. Bluetooth Connectivity is alright, only once out of a week did it struggle to connect to my phone but still whenever I turn on my bluetooth pairs up quickly.

8. Take occassional breaks while using this as earcups are big enough to cover the hollow parts of your ear at the same time fitting perfectly on top of my skeletal structures thus creating pain with continous usage.; Mic doesnt work properly, apparently only works with bluetooth mode - why????
Has issues connecting with bluetooth.
Sound quality not good.
Also it is not comfy for the ears.; Not at all good !! Connect issue, sound is okay not like other brands too heavy dont know for what reason/no proper mic; I've had my headphones for a while now, and I'd like to share my thoughts on them. Let's start with the not-so-great aspects:

‚ñ°Bad Qualities ‚ñ°
1. Defective Headphone
From day one, I noticed a significant issue with the right side of my headphones. When I turn the volume up to the maximum or above the recommended level, it starts making loud and disturbing noises like ""zzz zzz"" alongside the audio I'm listening to. This makes it quite challenging to understand what's being played. Fortunately, I usually keep the volume at a moderate level, so it's manageable for me. I considered getting them replaced, but the reputation of noise company' poor customer service discouraged me..

2. Sound leakage: Another downside is that when I crank up the volume, people around me can hear what I'm listening to through my headphones, which can be a bit embarrassing in public spaces.

Now, let's talk about the positive aspects:

‚òÜGood Qualities‚òÜ
1. Impressive Battery Life: Charging these headphones for just one hour lasts me almost an entire week, which is incredibly convenient.

2. Excellent Sound Quality: At the recommended volume levels, the sound quality is fantastic, providing a rich and immersive listening experience.

3. Noise Isolation: These headphones do an excellent job of isolating external noise, making it possible for me to enjoy my music even in crowded places like Mumbai local trains.

4. Stylish Design: I must say these headphones look good. They have a sleek and modern design that complements my style.

5. Comfortable Fit: They are quite comfortable to wear for extended periods, which is perfect for long commutes or extended listening sessions.

6. Easy Controls: The buttons on these headphones are well-placed and easy to access, allowing me to control playback and adjust the volume without needing to touch my phone.

In summary, my headphone experience has been a mixed. While they have some drawbacks, such as the defective right side and sound leakage at high volumes, the positive aspects like long battery life, excellent sound quality, and comfort make them a decent choice for daily use.

I would recommend these headphones, especially for students. They offer excellent comfort, making them suitable for attending 6-7 hour long online lectures or studying online for extended periods. Additionally, they are quite durable, which makes them a good choice for working professionals. However, if you encounter a defective unit like I did, consider getting it replaced. It's also essential to be aware that the ""Noise"" company is known for its poor customer service, so keep that in mind before making a purchase decision.; Very nice product build quality very good and mat finished gaming latency very good played bgmi with no lag. Mic quality nice. Value for maney product very cheap withs loads of features. Song quality very basy and clear. Foldable feature very good for portabilty.; 1. Sound quality is good.
2. Bass quality is also good.
3. Battery backup is superb.
4. Charging is also fast (not too fast but yeah, fast) and type-C port is a good addition.
5. Buttons are tactile and good so you won't have any problems with that.
6. Matte finish on the surface feels premium but it gets fingerprint smudges so try to keep it clean.
7. SD-card slot and aux support is appreciable.
8. Not durable because it is completely built with plastic, a little amount of metal is used at sides (under elongated part) so if you sleep while wearing it, then only God can save it.
9. After sometime, the points from where it collapses/folds gets loosened up, and you won't be able to jog while wearing it because of its loose fitting.
10. It is a good option at Rs. 1500, if its priced higher then look for other options."

The battery is very good but the charging cable is very short in length.
Built quality is very good feels premium. It's quite smaller than expected and I faced but fitting issue it's quite loose on my head
Connectivity is very fast & Dual Pairing.

Overall I'm satisfied because these days good headphones at affordable range rarely exist. This headphone completes my need of a portable and folding headphone with long lasting battery. The only issue which I found is the sound leakage rest is fine.; I've been using these headphones for a while now. The build quality is excellent and they're definitely not as heavy as some of the other reviews suggest. They're a little tighter around the ears, but that's not a problem for me. It helps with the passive noise cancellation, which is cool. The sound quality is quite good, and listening to music on these is a lot of fun. You can tweak the sound using several equalizers in the app. Keep tweaking until you find what works best for you. These headphones can also be used to consume media other than music, such as videos. The headphones come with Bluetooth 5.0 and AUX support in case you run out of battery. So far, I haven't had any problems with the connection. It's stable and works well when you move around a bit. The battery is the best thing about this product. It easily lasts well over a week on one charge, which is great because I use it every day. So far, I've been really pleased with this product. They're a little pricey, but they're definitely worth it!; The fit is good. Sound quality is outstanding also build quality is premium very comfortable.; These are absolute steal in this price! The design, colour, sound quality and battery life are amazing. The battery life is actually super amazing! I use them for 5 hours straight and the battery doesn't even drop down 1% which is mind boggling. For someone like me who listens to music for long hours, the battery life is a blessing. My head is a little sensitive so it starts hurting though, otherwise I can wear them for 10 hours straight. I got these on 11th May and Today is 18th may. I recieved them at 40% that I have charged them only once till 80% and used them continuosly everyday. I still have that 80% battery left. The colour is beautiful. The sound quality is really nice for the price range. Better than Boat ones for sure! The bass and the treble is perfect. The music feels heavenly at 80% volume. Even though the body is plastic, it feels premium. I was doubtful about this colour due to lack of photos and reviews but I am super glad I went for these, they look classy! Calling is also much better than the boat ones I had earlier. All-in-all, you will not be disappointed after using these.; Fast charging and long-lasting for me cuz I dont use it continuously all day
Sound wise its good
Quality of the product top notch. Came with dust bag,2 types of charges cable and leather quality is sooo goood and soft and it doesn't affect the ears but it will if u gonna use for a long time like any headphone does .
Calls -I dont think its good, the other person can hear you only if there is no distractions like fan and background noises and ull hear all the background noise when ur listening to songs.
So I think there is more options out there for this price so look for other options.; After using completely for 2 days (only removing it for sleep), i can say that sound quality is really good, the sound mixing is good and the overall sound feels dynamic but it causes pain after an hour or two. Then, there is significant sound leakage when the volume is above 80.

i was listening to music, when my parents was sleeping, they literally woke up due to sound leakage from the headphone. To give perspective, when the headphone is listened on max volume, outside people can hear it as sound 20 or 30. This is bad....

So buy this if u want an good looking headphone with good sound output but remember the cons: heavy, can't wear it for long hours, sound leakage

i am thinking of returning it.. to get a over the ear headphones; ; Buenos aud√≠fonos, calidad en el sonido y en el volumen. Por el tipo de aud√≠fono no ofrece un aislamiento completo del ruido pero la esponja hace muy bien su trabajo para camcelqr sobresalientemente el ruido exterior.
Una ventaja es que son Muy ligeros y c√≥modos por lo que puedes usarlos durante mucho tiempo si. Que sean molestos por el peso o que lastimen la cabeza y orejas.

La mayor ventaja que le veo es el aplicaci√≥n que se puede descargar para configurar el tipo ecualuzacion que se desea dependiendo del g√©nero.; The bass boost on these are crazy. They do cinch to your head nicely where they won't fall off so easily like other headphones I've had. They charge pretty fast and the battery life for me last a while because I'm a music fan so I love to listen to music for hours on end. I think it's a good value I wish they were a little bit cheaper but they are definitely a good deal and they do go wherever you go bluetooth availability and it also has an aux cord just in case. I love them. And the color is a plus as well also the cushioning on the ear portion is soft it does get a little sweaty though. Also they are very loud which I love as well and they are noise canceling.; I have been a fan of Anker cords so when I found nd myself looking for a set of headphones, these stood out to me. the reviews were good, the battery life promise kind of hooked me and so I thought I'd give them a shot. I was not disappointed! The sound is amazing compared to ones I have used before. The ear pads are smaller than full coverage so they aren't the best for noise cancelling (but somewhat). They connected very easily and feel nice on my ears. The battery life is amazing. I have charged them in the week or so since I got them but only because of habit (my old ones could barely go a day).
The one problem I have with them is they feel wide and big on my head and I wish I could make the adjustable band a bit smaller to be more snug on my head. I just have a small head so if you have a large one, great, lol!
Anyway, I'm impressed and hope they last me for a long time to come.; Der Klang dieses Kopfh√∂rers ist gut - aber auch nicht mehr. Es fehlt etwas an Klarheit, daf√ºr ist die Lautst√§rke sehr gut und der Bass abartig - und f√ºr mein Empfinden viel zu viel wenn man den Bass-Boost aktiviert. Der Tragekomfort ist ok, wenngleich dieser Kopfh√∂rer schon deutlich auf die Ohren dr√ºckt. Die Bluetooth Verbindung und Reichweite ist tadellos, die Akku-Laufzeit exzellent.
Das Beste aber an dem Kopfh√∂rer ist das wirklich exzellente Preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis: All das um nur EUR 20.- ist nat√ºrlich der Hammer - deswegen trotz der angef√ºhrten Mankos 5 Sterne.; Amazing quality, amazing sound, beautiful clear microphones, lovely bass, unmatched battery life, fits well and easy to setup, as an audiophile who has owned over 20 pairs of headphones, at this price point, they are unmatched, with an amazing free app that syncs your equaliser settings between devices"

Final Remarks: It is a decent product as a whole within this price segment and can give you a commendable experience.; I recently purchased the boAt Rockerz 450 Bluetooth On-Ear Headphones, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed with the overall experience.

Firstly, let's talk about the packaging - it's sleek and well-designed, setting the stage for what's to come. Setting up the headphones was a breeze; connecting to Bluetooth was as simple as a few taps on my device, and I was ready to go in no time.

Now, onto the sound quality - it's fantastic. The 40mm drivers deliver crisp, clear audio across a range of frequencies, making for an immersive listening experience. Whether I'm enjoying music, watching videos, or taking calls, the sound is consistently top-notch.

Speaking of calls, the integrated mic performs admirably. It captures my voice clearly, ensuring smooth communication without any hiccups. And being wireless, I appreciate the freedom it offers - no tangled cords or restricted movements.

Design-wise, the boAt Rockerz 450 doesn't disappoint. The luscious black color scheme exudes sophistication, while the padded ear cushions provide comfort even during extended use. It's a stylish accessory that complements any outfit or setting.

Battery life is another highlight. Straight out of the box, the headphones were fully charged, ready to deliver up to 15 hours of playback on a single charge. The charging process is straightforward, ensuring that I'm never caught off guard by a dead battery.

Overall, the boAt Rockerz 450 Bluetooth On-Ear Headphones exceed expectations on all fronts. With impressive sound quality, convenient wireless connectivity, and a sleek design, they're a must-have for any music lover or tech enthusiast. Whether you're using them with your PC or on the go, these headphones deliver an exceptional audio experience that's hard to beat. Highly recommended.; At this price this is a very good purchase.
The biggest pros is its sound qaulity is amazing
And the biggest con is the fitting of the headphone is such that both earpieces are pushing my both ears towards center. The fitting is thumbs down but still a good purchase.; The boAt Rockerz line is boAt's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.

1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.
2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.
3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.
5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.
4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?

Decent product for the price. The product feels a little fragile but you can't expect more for this price. The bass is decent but not very controlled. The mids and lows are fine too.; Nice headphone that does the job of attending the calls and listening to music. Good quality at this price range.; The headphone quality is just about okay. For the price you get better headphones from different brands. Only good thing is it feels really comfortable on the ears.
Disappointed that it does not even have a microphone. Watch out for the product description. Even if it says microphone is supported, the piece received would not have any microphone.; I doubted the HEADPHONES reading the reviews.. But the product was at 1500 when I saw it in flipkart and Amazon for the first time. I knew that there will be some offers , and found the lightning deal of this product. I purchased it for 999 and the product was delivered the next day although I just ordered it in the night . The product is heavenly awesome and the sound bass is amazing. I SAY THIS IS THE BEST HEADPHONES BELOW 1200.; Previously, I used the Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB450AP, which was an excellent product from Sony at a similar price point. Naturally, I expected the Sony MDR-ZX310AP to have comparable build quality, sound quality, and size. However, I was shocked when I received the product.

The headphones are the size of a hairband. The speakers barely cover the ears, and the plastic used feels as cheap as that found in low-quality toys. Additionally, the wire is so thin that it resembles the use-and-throw earphones given out on airplanes.

I am absolutely dissatisfied with this purchase.; Earphones do good job in covering entire range. Looks good and is comfortable to wear.

Does not completely reduce external noise. Does not have bass effect.; Happy with performance. However, wire length is an issue."

ÊúâÁ∑ö„ÇÇ„Åü„Åæ„Å´„ÅØËâØ„ÅÑ„Åß„Åô„Å≠„ÄÇ; I got these for my 8 year old son and these headphones have absolutely no right to sound this good for $20. I am an audiophile with 30 years of listening experience and I am absolutely stunned at what they have been able to achieve at such a low price point. Simply put, this level of sound quality just wouldn't have been possible even 10 years ago.

What strikes you most about the sound is the sense of dynamics and rhythmic drive. Even out of a bare iPhone 6 with no headphone amp, these 'phones deliver a nice energy to the music, following rhythmic lines quickly and easily. The bass in particular came through with authority and weight and I was impressed at how solid and punchy it sounded - again, for this price point. This is not nearly a high resolution set of 'phones by any stretch - for example, the treble is slightly rolled off to be sure, but personally I'd much prefer treble that is rolled off and still pleasing, rather than the shrill sound that is far too common with cheap gear. They seemed to work reasonably well directly out of my iPhone and Macbook too, sounding just fine directly from the headphone jack with no amp needed. But of course they DID sound much much better with one of my home headphone amps (Naim Audio Headline in the context of an all-Naim system), where they even began to even start to give you a tiny bit of ""snap"" - but then again, using a set of $20 headphones with an $800 headphone amp is pretty ridiculous and unlikely! But it was a fun experiment.

Lastly, the headphones themselves seemed much higher quality than the price would suggest. The earpieces were soft and overall they were reasonably comfortable. All in all, you just can't go wrong with these, and I was simply not expecting this at only 20 bucks. What have you got to lose?; I bought these to use on public transit on my way to and from work. I wanted a cheap pair in case they got broken or stolen. I must admit, when I first opened the package they arrived in I wasn't impressed, but I gave them a chance. I had read all of the negative comments about them. I have had them for a few weeks now and I like them. They are comfortable, the sound is decent, there is more bass than I expected. I also have a pair of studio beats and a pair of studio AKGs that I love. For the price, if something happens to them, I would get another pair. The negative remarks I read must be people who are very picky and hard to please. You can't expect good quality from inexpensive headphones. I am pleased for the price I paid. They definitely don't compare to my beats or AKGs but they aren't supposed to.; Clarity is awesome! A great buy. At first it is tight over the ears but with a few expanding pulls it become easy to fit. A must have product."

The sound quality is still so pure, so is bass, connectivity, battery capacityüëåüèº
So Iam a daily user, I use it all the time, atleast 11-14 hours per day on average...(Iam really into music), you won't have my issues earlier!!!ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The battery life is still holding upüîãüí™üèº, I could use for 2 days with one full charge of 1-1.5 hour.
The cushion pads are also very comfyüò¥
The switches are still good as new...
Connecting two device at the same time was very useful for me.
Even though it has bad noise cancellation features!!ü•≤
Everything checks out,this is worth it......ü§ù
but the physically it might have some issuesüôÇ, the cushion pad skin have started to come off by 5th monthü§ï( which is normal for any headset, and I am a using it all the time),and now, by 7th month iam noticing small cracks over the top, bend plastic part, which iam assuming might break in weeks for good but it was worth it. Although I did hope it would last more than a yearü§ß.....the battery or the sound quality, everything's perfect, physical damage is what limits(which again is normal, considering my heavy usage); Honest review only. Based on sound Quality for the price.
1) Bass/Low frequency- Bass lovers this is for you. Amazing bass, clear and punchy, powerfull. No Forcefully Boomy bass like Boat. Hip hop, Pop music is enjoyable on these.
2) Vocals/ Mid frequency- I'd say that it's Good considering the price but not my the best, You could easily hear some podcast and interviews the vocal are clear but when a song is played and the vocals gets little overshadowed by Bass while playing bass heavy songs.
3) Trebble/ High frequency - I'd say it's Just above average. Here too bcoz of Bass the Trebble gets little only little overshadowed. but with Equilizer this can be balanced and you could hear them easily and is enjoyable.
4) Now comes Sound clarity, instrumental seperation and Sound stage/stereo.- Now even though it's just a 700 I say this works absolutely fine.
The Sound stage is Not very veryWide but just good you can here and feel If any type of sound effect is paning from left to right or vice versa.
The Instrument Seperation is Above average too but needed much More seperation . so does the clarity. No doubt all frequency Low, Mids,High are clear but Trebble needed to be more clear as the Bass is on the Higher side. But it all come down to the price. Yes as I know I am expecting too much for the Price. Bcoz I have heard much better quality sound in other headphones but they cost more than 2K. The Sound quality for the Price is Justified and Very Good.
5th Noise cancellation and Physical Appearance- this is A little bit of Over the earphone type design so my Large Ears gets Fully coverd and so someone with small ears boom this will Fit you well. And noise cancellation there is no Active noise cancellation but the Over the ear Type Makes it Passive voice cancelling Headphone and I have used it in Bus in heavy traffic with Loud Outside noise but then too I was able to here sound from headphone easily at 70% and it blocked outside Traffice horn and vehicle sound. So here it score too.
Blue tooth connectivity and range is is fast and good, button are tactile and good.
6th Gaming- Gaming you will get some latency but is playable for BGMi But the judging the enemy Foot steps is bit of task due to the Average Sound stage and instrumental seperation as well as Average Trebble.
Rest all is good and is A very Good Headphone.; Writing this review (cons.)after using for 15 days.
1. Sound on v. Call is very poor sometimes sound buffers, also sound gets cut frequently from the other side on call.
2. Not so comfortable for long hours.
3. Not for those who dive into music for hours.
4. I would like to give it a bare 1 star ‚≠ê for overall experience.
5. Just invest some extra into other headphones, not to regret later like I am.üòêüôÅ; Sound was good, product is nice, Quality is better then boat company; The plastic body cracked at the point the pivot joins the head cushion , it's not just me , but me 2 other friends have the same problem because we bought it together , all same , and there's a crack within 4 months , and ear cushion plastic is coming out , ofcourse the sound quality is really good , and very very very loud at its full volume , just hand it in your neck , and raise the volume , deafing sound; Headphone is good audio quality is good but quality of cusion in below average; Good Quality built & sound.; While the sound and battery performance is decent, the ear cushions are very flimsy and tears off in less then a month of average use.

It offers a good backup battery. It sounds fantastic as well. Adaptable to fit different head sizes. The product is hybrid. Both wired and wireless connections are supported. If your battery runs out, you can use the wire to keep using it.
There is only one issue that I have observed, and that is sweating during the summer.; I have got the black color for me. Battery backup is too good and you can use with aux cable to reserve battery. Sound quality is okay but in higher volume, sound leaks and anyone near you can hear clearly. Noise cancellation is almost none, and call quality is ok(dual pairing is available so if you receive a call on phone and on your pc some video was playing it will get paused automatically , but the problem is call quality gets seriously degraded if you turn on the video - call will get garbled and you wouldn't be able to understand a single word of the person you are talking to. ear sponge quality is ok , you get one on head , and get ready to have sweaty ears in long session. Sponge can be connected again using thin spoon if they get open from the ear cup. Random disconnection is here and there and there is some minor delay - mind it if you are planning to use as gaming headphone , singleplayer is ok but not for multiplayer. biggest drawback is there is no system to fold the earcups. overall good budget headphone.; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition. Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad. It is not good for gaming. For gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.
Thank you for reading just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.; Sound quality and battery is very good.
Price is aslo good, but product is not durable for long time... Maybe product will not work after 12 month.; Sound great,price affordable,mic quality ok hai, connectivity quickly response karta hai, plastick body hai ok hai , comfortable hai per halka sweat aata hai near ear; I bought this product about 2.5 months back, My purpose of buying this headphone is to watch lectures, binge watching of movies I was wondering for budget friendly headphone under rupees 1,000.

So, After using this product for about 2.5 months and still using it. I would like to share the likes and dislikes of this product based on my usage.

Likes :
1) Sound quality is good and crisp great for listening lectures and watching movies and other content.
2) Battery life is also good it gives output of about 15 hours my daily usage is about 4-5 hours.
3) Bluetooth range is quite good for this budget.

Dislikes :
1) It's leather quality is very bad not satisfied with its quality to the leather was ripped out within just 2 months.
2) the plastic quality is not so good you can get scratches on its body easily.
3) it consumes more time to get charge it takes around 3-4 hours for 100% charging.
4) the glue used in this headphones cushion are not applied properly it comes out of the body within 1 month only.
5) the noise cancellation is not good you can easily hear outdoor activities sound Even at full volume.

Based on this budget it's a good product from Indian Brands Zebronics but comes with a lot of comprises.

If you really want quality good headphones atleast go for budget higher than rupees 2,500 or select other brands like sony, boat and other brands.; The quality is good and and sound was low because my right side not working and some small defective but product was good üëç; The product is good but they are faking too much by telling there's ENC and Gaming mode while there's no feature like that, it's just a normal Bluetooth headphone. However portability is good, comfort is good durability i would say cheap it can break easily also aux cable is not durable, sound quality good for this price range."

I decided to switch to these headphones since earbuds just don't fit properly in my ears and feel like they'll fall off any second. I've been using these non-stop for the past 2 months now and they're still working as new. I'm a very reckless user so the fact that there's not even a single scratch on them is amazing. The sound quality is great compared to the shitty stuff I've been using before.

One drawback is that it gets loose very fast. It does get a bit annoying since I always keep my hair open and it sometimes slides here and there, almost slipping off my head if I look down for too long. A quick fix is to tie a rubber band around it overnight so it fits nice and snug in the morning. I also wish there was more emphasis on the bass but you can just tweak the equaliser on the app and it's all good.

One more thing is that I wish these were noise cancelling. I use public transport, so I have to use a volume booster because of how loud the background noise gets.

Lookswise, It looks very sleek and modern which goes with all outfits.

If you're on a budget and you want a good quality pair of headphones that look good as well, these are the best ones!!

Update: Its currently June 2024, so over a year of owning these headphones and there's quite a bit of wear and tear. The top layer of the cushions is peeling off quite a bit, and I've noticed that the Bluetooth connectivity isn't quite as strong as before? If that's possible? Still really great in terms of audio quality and battery life. I think I just need to buy replacements for the ear cushions but I'm not sure what to do about the cushion that's on the top of the head.

I wish they had included a AUX port in case the battery runs out. That's my only complaint with these headphones.; The headphone is mediocre for daily use. It is decently comfortable but can't passively isolate much background noise due to lack of active noise cancellation (ANC). After long use it hurts my ears a little bit but not so much to complain about. The sound quality is good but not excellent. The bass is not upto the expectation. The long battery life is good and for me it lasts for more than 2 weeks with 2-3 hours of use every day. The app is good and lets me adjust the sound profile.; The sound quality is great, dual connectivity makes switching the device a piece of cake compared to single connecting devices. Build quality is good for the price but is not great, I feel like I have to be careful when putting in my bag. Fit is also comfortable but long outs with the over ear design is definitely not comfortable; All features and feels are awesome. Sturdy built and audio quality is good.Charging speed is also fast. Good quality of audio call due to good mic placement. Weight is good and manageable, earpads are also confortable enough. Look & feel justifies the price.; Build quality is awesome, very lightweight, ok ok noise cancellation bit bass is really good. I am using these from a year now, battery backup is next level. Very easy to use.; Love the headphones. Amazing sound quality and soft ear pads helps in long term usage. I have been using since a month and have no issues. I have used boat before and I have faced issues in connecting bluetooth but this is very quick. Also the battery life is 100/10. Overall amazing product

Negatives:
When I use fan on full speed, my voice is not clear. So not so much on the noise cancellation they claim; I‚Äôve lately been having problem while hearing the sound of audio as the headphone‚Äôs making buzz sounds and multi point connections is also not working (within a month).; Headphones give immersive natural sound.

Build quality is just ok. Does not feel very sturdy. The cloth they have used to cover the speakers sometimes sheds strings.

Pretty comfortable to use due to light weight and very soft and big cushioning. Although heat builds up if used continuously.

The headphones could have been more compact. They appear bigger after wearing.; √ìtimo produto, som de √≥tima qualidade e bateria excelente; O som muito bom, e grava√ß√µes de √°udio no Whatsapp saem com boa qualidade. √â reconhecido r√°pido no Bluetooth do smartphone.
A cor e o modelo s√£o bonitos e pr√°ticos. Um custo/benef√≠cio bom.; Very good sound and product is very light, price was the best not to expensive and good quality.; I've had thse headphones, for two months now, for the gym and I still have not charged them since the day I got them. I cannot say enough.; These are great headphones for this price, and they can often be found at a discount. I've used them extensively for the past few months and they have gotten better over time.

COMFORT:
Initially, they were a bit stiff and uncomfortable, especially the ear pads. They would make my ears a bit sore after an hour or two of use. After a few months, the ear pads and headband have softened up and they feel much more comfortable. I can wear them all day and not feel a thing. They somehow feel more comfortable than my Sony WH1000XM4's which are $300 premium noise cancelling headphones. The XM4s make my ears very hot and the top headband hurts the top of my head after a while. These WH-CH520s keep my ears cooler by virtue of them being on-ear rather than over-ear, as well as staying comfortable on my head all day due to their light weight.

SOUND QUALITY:
The sound quality on these is great for the price and size of the drivers. Out of the box with no EQ I'd describe the overall sound as being slightly warm but very accurate. They have a slight V-shape Harmann Curve sound profile, with very clear and present mids. The bass is clear and pretty clean without being too thumpy; not the quickest bass response I've heard though. The trebles are a bit recessed but pleasant on the ear. However, you can boost the treble up with EQ in the Sony Headphones app at 6.3K Hz by a few dB to get more detail. These are definitely geared towards general consumer use with a very slightly sound profile perfect for pop, rap, rock, edm, indie, podcasts, etc. However, I was surprised to find that the bass is very tame and accurate, and the mids are crystal clear and sit perfectly in the mix. At this price-point and target consumer I was expecting these to be very boomy and washed out sounding, but they are actually very balanced and accurate. They really shine in vocals, voices always sound very forward and detailed. In terms of sound stage, they're a clear step above any in-ear headphones, but they aren't as wide as a typical over-ear headphones, which is to be expected. Imaging is great and accurate, they do a great job accurately placing all of the instruments in a stereo mix. Overall the sound on these pleasantly surprised me and definitely punch way above their weight class for the price. They sound as detailed and accurate as $100 headphones. If you're looking for something very ""neutral,"" these are your headphones. But with the EQ provided in Sony's Headphone app, you can theoretically have these sound almost exactly how you want.

BATTERY LIFE:
Battery life on these is amazing. They can last me around 4-5 days with around 7-8 hours of use each day. I use them nearly all day during work. They charge really quickly too, which is great.

FUNCTIONS:
They have a standard pause/play/skip/answer/hang-up middle button, as well as volume up and down buttons. You can skip and rewind by holding the volume buttons.

They can also be paired with Sony's headphone app which allows you to change the EQ settings for these and have them sound how you want. There aren't a ton of sliders for the EQ, but enough for most people to customize their sound to their liking. There's also a fun custom EQ feature in the app that asks you to pick your favorite sound profile from various examples and builds you a custom EQ profile based on your taste.

The microphone on these are pretty good for headphones. They sound better than average in terms of headphone mics, but they don't sound nearly as good as the iPhone 15's built-in microphone. But if you need these for a quick phone call or video call, they work great. They can't fold up in any way but the ear cups can swivel up. So if you take them off your head and swivel them to hang around your neck, the ear pads will face up; which isn't good nor bad, just something to keep in mind.

EXERCISE:
If you're the type to use headphones rather than earphones when exercising, these would probably suffice. They are breathable and lightweight, while also having a decent clamping force to stay on your head. If i shake my head vigorously though, they inevitably fall off. The earpads are a faux-leather so they're very easy to wipe off and clean. Although, I'm typically the type of person to use earphones while exercising. The most extensive exercise I've done with these headphones is skateboard with them, but as soon as I start jumping around to do any tricks, they start to slide off my head. They should do fine with typical gym exercises movements though, they won't slide off if you're looking down.

NOISE CANCELLATION:
In terms of noise cancellation, they are decent. They obviously don't have any active noise cancelling features, but passively, they block a bit of noise, maybe 10-12 dB or so. They aren't going to blow your mind though in terms of noise cancellation. However, if you have music playing at around 40-50% volume, they block out a considerable amount of outside noise like most headphones do. I can walk through busy downtown streets with these and not hear much at all if I have music going. They'll definitely block out a considerable amount of noise in an office, cafe, train ride, etc. so long as you're actually listening to something.

BUILD QUALITY:
These headphones are built surprisingly well. The materials are obviously cheap, but they don't feel like it. The plastic is lightweight, but solid at the same time. The earpads and headband padding are both the same faux-leather, which is a bit stiff at first but softens up over time. The padding feels like it will last a long time simply because of its synthetic nature.

DESIGN:
Taste in the way these are designed is obviously subjective, but I think these look great. They have a modern, but more timeless design. They don't look super retro, but they don't look super modern either. They just look like clean, standard headphones that will look great for years. I love how the Sony logo is faintly placed on one side of the headband. It's there, but not obnoxious."

‚Ä¢ sound quality is decent, there is ANC (active noise cancellation) which isn't really good, you will be disappointed if you bought it for noice cancellation, it does supress a little external sound but not even remotely impressive

‚Ä¢ It looks beautiful, mine is black, although it doesn't seem very durable, now i am confident i can take great care of it, but if you aren't careful then it might end up breaking within first few months of purchase.

‚Ä¢ Ambient mode is extremely helpful during functions or any event where you need to be attentive, maybe someone is calling you or something else, so using Ambient mode you can hear external sound more clearly

‚Ä¢ One of the main reason i bought it is because of the battery, and it didn't disappoint, absolute monster when it comes to battery, you can use it for 6 hours continuously and only 10%-5% battery will be consumed.

‚Ä¢ It is also extremely comfortable and covers your ears really well, it's foldable but again handle with care, it doesn't seem very durable, modes such as signature sound makes the listening phenomenal.

‚Ä¢ Gaming - now i didn't expect it to perform this well in terms of gaming but i was surprised, while they didn't mention anything about gaming experience, it did perform very well, games checked - (PUBG, Terraria, COD, Dead Cells, Little Nightmare).; I got these for RS. 1500 and let me tell you that for the price they're amazing.

The sound quality is great due to its 50mm drivers, the bass is very loud and you'll be able to feel that thump of the bass.

The reason I keep telling that they're good FOR THE PRICE is that the build quality is not very good, it's made of plastic which is good enough. The hinges and very low quality. My Left hinge broke after around a one and a half year of use.

But if you look at the prize and the things you get it's worth it. I have other expensive hyper x headphones but the bass that the Rockerz 550 give is better than them

It won't last for long but for its price it's really good, if you take extra good care of it I'm sure it'll have a long life.
The thing is even though the left hinge of my rockers 550 has broken the sound quality is still as good as the day I got them.; The built quality is good . It is comfortably and the noise cancellation is next level as it prevents all the background noise. I tried calling on it and it was pretty decent. The vocals were clear. The bass it good . wont suggests for a bass head . The only disappointment was with to vocals. They are crystal clear and sharp but not soft . Like u can consider it is suitable for hiphop songs but wont be that great for classicals. In general its good but ill suggest if ur planing to buy for vocals clearity plz search for better options. This is my persnal opinion.; I got it for 2600 rs and after one month of usage, here's my review
Pros:
1. decent audio, no complaints there
2. Transparancy mode works well
3. Noice cancelation gets rid of the the general noise, but doesn't work well when someone's talking or around constructions or loud noises. Decent for the price I would say.
4. Battery life is amazing. Better than some high end headphones.
5. It's over ear so it's decently comfortable. Ear cups are pretty soft so you can wear it for a couple of hours at a time. Your ears might get a little hot and sweaty after long usage, but it's definitely anything but uncomfortable.

Cons:
1. Durability is a big issue. For so many features at such small price, i guess they cut costs at durability. If you are a rough handler, I would suggest not to get this. One of the earpiece was roasted 180¬∞ about the joint. I had to carefully move it back into its place. It's now loose, though it is my fault, for not taking care, but for this price, the product shouldn't be this non-durable. I've seen cheaper headphones which are much more durable.

Conclusion: if you can take good care of this headphone, do go for it if it's under 3k.
It is truly value for money below 3k. If it's around 3.5k, I would suggest waiting for a price drop.; This is the only overear headphones under 8k but this has the price of 2k that are far better than tws or onear headphones in terms of ear health just go for it I have using it from 1 year any quality issues with this doesn't happen and the sound quality is also good.overear headphones do some passive noise cancellation to cut the external noise.; This product bass quality is not much batter I personally suggest that don‚Äôt buy this product if you are a bass lover or havey sound and the batter is not bad it was surviv up to 9 to 10 days and comfort is also better but squatting in side tha ear after 20 to 40 min and cussen in very soft and her quality is good not bad build quality was also batter the other headphones and one other bad think is that her charging poat is older not c type if the boat company is plat that charging poart the that was a very good think if you are buying as a use for gaming thin you can buy this this is a good product for gaming very low latency this this headphone"

Liked the place where buttons configured on the left cup and looks premium. Grey and golden makes it classy. Audio jack included and connects well. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.
Thank you very much,

For those who want all goods and bads here they are:

1. Build Quality
a. On Ear headphones (not over ear headphones)
b. Lighter overall weight than its competitors (187 grams)
c. Neither too Sturdy not too Flimsy
d. Foldable (earcups)
e. Chance for fingerprint attraction
f. Very precisely fits my beefy head
g. Ear cups are soft and will suit if u have average sized ears
h. Matte finish (surface is not reflective)
i. Fit on my ears is rather small and its not as good as over head earphones.

2. Sound Quality
a. Great Noise Cancellation for this price
b. Volume can get pretty loud
c. Heavy Audio leakage
d. Great Bass
e. Mids are decent

3. Ports & Buttons
a. USB - C charging port
b. 3.5mm headphone Jack
c. SD Card slot that supports my 32GB Sandisk
d. Tactical buttons usable for almost all media controls including voice assistant

4. One Year Warranty card which u should claim

5. Battery life good lasted me 5 days for a power user like me

6. Audio Quality is great - Very balanced instead of fancy stuff like Bass boosted, etc. Thus giving user the control to equalize their songs.

7. Bluetooth Connectivity is alright, only once out of a week did it struggle to connect to my phone but still whenever I turn on my bluetooth pairs up quickly.

8. Take occassional breaks while using this as earcups are big enough to cover the hollow parts of your ear at the same time fitting perfectly on top of my skeletal structures thus creating pain with continous usage.; Mic doesnt work properly, apparently only works with bluetooth mode - why????
Has issues connecting with bluetooth.
Sound quality not good.
Also it is not comfy for the ears.; Not at all good !! Connect issue, sound is okay not like other brands too heavy dont know for what reason/no proper mic; I've had my headphones for a while now, and I'd like to share my thoughts on them. Let's start with the not-so-great aspects:

‚ñ°Bad Qualities ‚ñ°
1. Defective Headphone
From day one, I noticed a significant issue with the right side of my headphones. When I turn the volume up to the maximum or above the recommended level, it starts making loud and disturbing noises like ""zzz zzz"" alongside the audio I'm listening to. This makes it quite challenging to understand what's being played. Fortunately, I usually keep the volume at a moderate level, so it's manageable for me. I considered getting them replaced, but the reputation of noise company' poor customer service discouraged me..

2. Sound leakage: Another downside is that when I crank up the volume, people around me can hear what I'm listening to through my headphones, which can be a bit embarrassing in public spaces.

Now, let's talk about the positive aspects:

‚òÜGood Qualities‚òÜ
1. Impressive Battery Life: Charging these headphones for just one hour lasts me almost an entire week, which is incredibly convenient.

2. Excellent Sound Quality: At the recommended volume levels, the sound quality is fantastic, providing a rich and immersive listening experience.

3. Noise Isolation: These headphones do an excellent job of isolating external noise, making it possible for me to enjoy my music even in crowded places like Mumbai local trains.

4. Stylish Design: I must say these headphones look good. They have a sleek and modern design that complements my style.

5. Comfortable Fit: They are quite comfortable to wear for extended periods, which is perfect for long commutes or extended listening sessions.

6. Easy Controls: The buttons on these headphones are well-placed and easy to access, allowing me to control playback and adjust the volume without needing to touch my phone.

In summary, my headphone experience has been a mixed. While they have some drawbacks, such as the defective right side and sound leakage at high volumes, the positive aspects like long battery life, excellent sound quality, and comfort make them a decent choice for daily use.

I would recommend these headphones, especially for students. They offer excellent comfort, making them suitable for attending 6-7 hour long online lectures or studying online for extended periods. Additionally, they are quite durable, which makes them a good choice for working professionals. However, if you encounter a defective unit like I did, consider getting it replaced. It's also essential to be aware that the ""Noise"" company is known for its poor customer service, so keep that in mind before making a purchase decision.; Very nice product build quality very good and mat finished gaming latency very good played bgmi with no lag. Mic quality nice. Value for maney product very cheap withs loads of features. Song quality very basy and clear. Foldable feature very good for portabilty.; 1. Sound quality is good.
2. Bass quality is also good.
3. Battery backup is superb.
4. Charging is also fast (not too fast but yeah, fast) and type-C port is a good addition.
5. Buttons are tactile and good so you won't have any problems with that.
6. Matte finish on the surface feels premium but it gets fingerprint smudges so try to keep it clean.
7. SD-card slot and aux support is appreciable.
8. Not durable because it is completely built with plastic, a little amount of metal is used at sides (under elongated part) so if you sleep while wearing it, then only God can save it.
9. After sometime, the points from where it collapses/folds gets loosened up, and you won't be able to jog while wearing it because of its loose fitting.
10. It is a good option at Rs. 1500, if its priced higher then look for other options."

Design, specifications and comfort
The Sony MDR-ZX110 looks fancy and expensive from a distance, with a combination of matte and gloss finishes on the body that comes across as more premium than anything else we've seen at this price. However, up close it feels strictly budget. The plastic is flimsy and bendy, and does not look or feel like it can take too much abuse, so careful handling is advised.

This headset has a rather unique folding mechanism that allows the ear cups to twist inwards, into the headband. This makes the MDR-ZX110 a bit easier to store when not in use. Apart from this, the Sony MDR-ZX110 has 30mm dynamic drivers, with a frequency response range of 12-22,000Hz, 24Ohms impedance and a sensitivity rating of 98dB. The MDR-ZX110 doesn't have an inline mic or remote control, but Sony does sell a nearly identical model, the MDR-ZX110AP which does, for Rs. 700 more.

The ear cups have very slight padding, which is enough for an acceptably comfortable on-ear fit. The headband has no cushioning, but is designed well and feels secure and comfortable in place. The MDR-ZX110 also has a thick, tough cable that looks like it can take a fair bit of strain. Past the Y-splitter, the 1.2m cable splits into two separate and somewhat flat cables that aren't quite as sturdy as the lower half. The design and thickness makes the cable somewhat tangle resistant, and extremely resistant to cable noise. On the whole, apart from the flimsiness, we're happy with how the Sony MDR-ZX110 looks and feels.

Performance
With the Sony MDR-ZX110 being an entry-level on-ear headset, we did most of our testing using an Android smartphone. We also tried it with our Fiio X1 high-resolution audio player and a Windows laptop. Focus tracks for the review were BT's Somnambulist, Skrillex and Diplo's To U, and Passenger's Circles.

Starting with the bass-heavy Somnambulist, we found that the Sony MDR-ZX110 had a meaty sound, with lots of emphasis on low-end attack. The bass can occasionally be overpowering, but is usually controlled thanks to the not-so-tight fit. The sonic signature has been tuned toward promoting the lows, and this makes for a very warm sound. This also tends to show a bit in the lower-mid ranges, but there is a clear sensitivity drop towards the upper end of the frequency range.Next, we cued up To U, which despite being a dubstep track, has plenty to offer in terms of the mid-range and detail. While the Sony headset is impressive in low-end detail, it seems to trail off going up the range. The result is a sound that isn't quite as open and detailed as we'd like, even at this price. Other products such as the Sennheiser HD180 offer better levels of detail at this price, so the MDR-ZX110 isn't something we'd recommend if you're looking for sonic clarity.

Finally, with Circles, we kept our ears open for imaging and soundstaging. While the Sony offers a full and aggressive presentation in the sound, it falls a bit short in terms of openness and width. The sonic stage feels narrow and specific, rather than properly spread out. However, the MDR-ZX110 certainly does its bit to make your music immersive and entertaining, especially if you like your headphones bassy and aggressive.

carry forward the typical aesthetic that makes Sony a popular headphone option, but it falls a bit short in terms of build quality. It feels cheap and we were always worried about damage during our time with the review unit. However, it offers an immersive, full sound that excels in its handling of bass. Detail and clarity suffer a bit, but bass-heads will not find too much to complain about at this price. If you're looking for a pair of on-ears with serious attack and drive at under Rs. 600 the Sony MDR-ZX110A should be on your wish list.; Value wise it gives very good service. Not the best headphone of sony, but this is the best headphone you get at that range. Except noise cancellation, everything else is very good. For noise cancellation, you need to press it against your ears or use equilizer in system. Would have been better if available in black; Sound quality is poo, build quality is more poo. Cable is too short, and doesn't connect for poo. It's like buying poo, with a smaller poo on top, and a short stringy poo hanging off of it, to wear on your head.; Pas trop cher et fait bien son travail! Belle qualit√© de son; Never had a problem with Sony headphones üéß always sound fantastic, value for money, long lasting and comfortable.

Connect the 3.5mm jack to the phone and wait for a few seconds for the product to get sync with the phone. Water Resistant : Yes; The snug-fit also ensures a passive noise cancellation so that you can bask in the pure audio experience.; Impedance 16 Œ©; Frequency response 20Hz-20kHz; Cable length 1.2m; Country of Origin: China,"I recently purchased the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones, and while they offer decent sound quality and a comfortable fit, there are some concerns regarding their durability.

Let's start with the positives. The earphones provide a snug fit, ensuring comfort even during long listening sessions. The 10mm drivers deliver satisfactory sound performance, allowing you to enjoy your favorite music and audio with clarity. The passive noise cancellation feature is an added bonus, as it helps immerse you in your audio experience by reducing external noise distractions.

Connecting the earphones to your device is a straightforward process. Simply plug in the 3.5mm audio jack, and within a few seconds, the earphones sync with your phone or tablet, ready to deliver audio.

On the downside, the build quality of the earphone cable raises concerns. Some users have reported that the wires are not as sturdy as expected, making them susceptible to damage and tangling. This weakness in the wire construction may impact the longevity of the earphones, requiring extra care and attention during use and storage.

The ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones come in a sleek design and are available in multiple color options, including Black, Blue, Green, Red, and White, allowing you to choose the one that suits your style.

In terms of technical specifications, the earphones have an impedance of 16 Œ© and a frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz. The 1.2-meter cable length provides adequate flexibility for comfortable usage.

It's important to note that these earphones come with a 6-month warranty, which provides some assurance in case of any manufacturing defects or malfunctions within the specified period.

In conclusion, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones offer decent sound quality and a comfortable fit, making them suitable for everyday use. However, the durability concerns surrounding the wire strength are worth considering. If you prioritize longevity and robustness in your earphone choice, you may want to explore other options. Nevertheless, if you handle them with care, these earphones can provide an enjoyable audio experience at an affordable price point.; The ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones present a mixed bag of features, catering to both audio quality enthusiasts and comfort seekers. With a snug fit and 10mm drivers, these earphones ensure a comfortable listening experience coupled with satisfactory sound performance. The passive noise cancellation feature enhances immersion by minimizing external distractions, ideal for music aficionados or those seeking solace in audiobooks during commutes.

Connecting these earphones is hassle-free, thanks to the straightforward plug-and-play mechanism. However, concerns arise regarding the durability of the earphone cable. Users have reported issues with wire sturdiness, highlighting susceptibility to tangling and damage. While the sleek design and color variety add aesthetic appeal, the compromise in build quality prompts cautious handling to prolong their lifespan.

Despite durability concerns, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones boast technical specifications such as a 16 Œ© impedance and a frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz. The 1.2-meter cable offers adequate flexibility for daily use. Additionally, the inclusion of a 6-month warranty provides reassurance against potential manufacturing defects, offering peace of mind to consumers.

In summary, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones deliver a comfortable fit and decent sound quality, suitable for regular use. However, prospective buyers should weigh the durability issues against their preferences. While these earphones offer an enjoyable audio experience at an affordable price point, those prioritizing longevity may opt for alternatives with sturdier construction. Nonetheless, with proper care, these earphones serve as a budget-friendly option for casual listeners.; The product is working except in Video Calls on WhatsApp; It's a good earphone with good quality music and base offered in this price range
But not for long use because of the thin wire it can break at any time
By the it's comfortable to wear to it and also is a good fit for small ear as well
The quality and Clarity in mic is just ok in this price; Sound quality is good but it's not very durable but I guess it's understandable for that price"

Well my review on this Zebronics headphones. Talking of build quality looks ok but a bit on the softer side it could show up damages as one uses it
Testing the output
I checked all parameters like the bass, treble,mid range sound highs and lows.
1.Bass check. I played Nothing else matters by Metallica. I was surprised it did sound great. The bass was good the lead guitar great drummer excellent,bass guitar perfect and rhythm guitar great.
2. Played Abba. ""Volez Vous"" Impressed again great output. The bass was fine, singing great too.
I will update my review after further testing this headphones.
Comfort factor
Not that good i would say. The ears do get caught up and one cannot wear the head set for a long time.
Noise cancellation.
Not really that effective.
It's a good headset to listen to your music. I haven't tested the calling feature which requires the inbuilt mic. Cable length just fine. It's a simple headset at a good price too. Though one cannot expect more juice out of it as compared to high end ones
One shot. Good for it.; One of the worst headset I have ever buy in 1 months it work fine but after that 1 month the mics was not working the noise was not coming good do Liberty is not good it is the one of the first headphone I have ever seen in my life I put not recommend anybody to buy this headset this is a one of the bus headset in my entire life and I am not going to buy Zebronics product again and when it is not working fine I try to claim warranty but there was no warranty; Very sleek and apt product, value for money and clear sound quality.; Sound quality is good and base is good. But cannot wear for more than 1 hour as it starts to cause pain in ear due to incorrect size. The speaker size is small for most ear sizes and so it does not fit properly causing discomfort.; The quality of the sound is good; The head phones have great bass and is very durable and good quality but it's is not comfortable for more than 15 mins the earmuffs are smaller than you expect.; Audio quality is okay.. but wire quality is not good.."

I decided to switch to these headphones since earbuds just don't fit properly in my ears and feel like they'll fall off any second. I've been using these non-stop for the past 2 months now and they're still working as new. I'm a very reckless user so the fact that there's not even a single scratch on them is amazing. The sound quality is great compared to the shitty stuff I've been using before.

One drawback is that it gets loose very fast. It does get a bit annoying since I always keep my hair open and it sometimes slides here and there, almost slipping off my head if I look down for too long. A quick fix is to tie a rubber band around it overnight so it fits nice and snug in the morning. I also wish there was more emphasis on the bass but you can just tweak the equaliser on the app and it's all good.

One more thing is that I wish these were noise cancelling. I use public transport, so I have to use a volume booster because of how loud the background noise gets.

Lookswise, It looks very sleek and modern which goes with all outfits.

If you're on a budget and you want a good quality pair of headphones that look good as well, these are the best ones!!

Update: Its currently June 2024, so over a year of owning these headphones and there's quite a bit of wear and tear. The top layer of the cushions is peeling off quite a bit, and I've noticed that the Bluetooth connectivity isn't quite as strong as before? If that's possible? Still really great in terms of audio quality and battery life. I think I just need to buy replacements for the ear cushions but I'm not sure what to do about the cushion that's on the top of the head.

I wish they had included a AUX port in case the battery runs out. That's my only complaint with these headphones.; The headphone is mediocre for daily use. It is decently comfortable but can't passively isolate much background noise due to lack of active noise cancellation (ANC). After long use it hurts my ears a little bit but not so much to complain about. The sound quality is good but not excellent. The bass is not upto the expectation. The long battery life is good and for me it lasts for more than 2 weeks with 2-3 hours of use every day. The app is good and lets me adjust the sound profile.; The sound quality is great, dual connectivity makes switching the device a piece of cake compared to single connecting devices. Build quality is good for the price but is not great, I feel like I have to be careful when putting in my bag. Fit is also comfortable but long outs with the over ear design is definitely not comfortable; All features and feels are awesome. Sturdy built and audio quality is good.Charging speed is also fast. Good quality of audio call due to good mic placement. Weight is good and manageable, earpads are also confortable enough. Look & feel justifies the price.; Build quality is awesome, very lightweight, ok ok noise cancellation bit bass is really good. I am using these from a year now, battery backup is next level. Very easy to use.; Love the headphones. Amazing sound quality and soft ear pads helps in long term usage. I have been using since a month and have no issues. I have used boat before and I have faced issues in connecting bluetooth but this is very quick. Also the battery life is 100/10. Overall amazing product

Negatives:
When I use fan on full speed, my voice is not clear. So not so much on the noise cancellation they claim; I‚Äôve lately been having problem while hearing the sound of audio as the headphone‚Äôs making buzz sounds and multi point connections is also not working (within a month).; Headphones give immersive natural sound.

Build quality is just ok. Does not feel very sturdy. The cloth they have used to cover the speakers sometimes sheds strings.

Pretty comfortable to use due to light weight and very soft and big cushioning. Although heat builds up if used continuously.

The headphones could have been more compact. They appear bigger after wearing.; √ìtimo produto, som de √≥tima qualidade e bateria excelente; O som muito bom, e grava√ß√µes de √°udio no Whatsapp saem com boa qualidade. √â reconhecido r√°pido no Bluetooth do smartphone.
A cor e o modelo s√£o bonitos e pr√°ticos. Um custo/benef√≠cio bom.; Very good sound and product is very light, price was the best not to expensive and good quality.; I've had thse headphones, for two months now, for the gym and I still have not charged them since the day I got them. I cannot say enough.; These are great headphones for this price, and they can often be found at a discount. I've used them extensively for the past few months and they have gotten better over time.

COMFORT:
Initially, they were a bit stiff and uncomfortable, especially the ear pads. They would make my ears a bit sore after an hour or two of use. After a few months, the ear pads and headband have softened up and they feel much more comfortable. I can wear them all day and not feel a thing. They somehow feel more comfortable than my Sony WH1000XM4's which are $300 premium noise cancelling headphones. The XM4s make my ears very hot and the top headband hurts the top of my head after a while. These WH-CH520s keep my ears cooler by virtue of them being on-ear rather than over-ear, as well as staying comfortable on my head all day due to their light weight.

SOUND QUALITY:
The sound quality on these is great for the price and size of the drivers. Out of the box with no EQ I'd describe the overall sound as being slightly warm but very accurate. They have a slight V-shape Harmann Curve sound profile, with very clear and present mids. The bass is clear and pretty clean without being too thumpy; not the quickest bass response I've heard though. The trebles are a bit recessed but pleasant on the ear. However, you can boost the treble up with EQ in the Sony Headphones app at 6.3K Hz by a few dB to get more detail. These are definitely geared towards general consumer use with a very slightly sound profile perfect for pop, rap, rock, edm, indie, podcasts, etc. However, I was surprised to find that the bass is very tame and accurate, and the mids are crystal clear and sit perfectly in the mix. At this price-point and target consumer I was expecting these to be very boomy and washed out sounding, but they are actually very balanced and accurate. They really shine in vocals, voices always sound very forward and detailed. In terms of sound stage, they're a clear step above any in-ear headphones, but they aren't as wide as a typical over-ear headphones, which is to be expected. Imaging is great and accurate, they do a great job accurately placing all of the instruments in a stereo mix. Overall the sound on these pleasantly surprised me and definitely punch way above their weight class for the price. They sound as detailed and accurate as $100 headphones. If you're looking for something very ""neutral,"" these are your headphones. But with the EQ provided in Sony's Headphone app, you can theoretically have these sound almost exactly how you want.

BATTERY LIFE:
Battery life on these is amazing. They can last me around 4-5 days with around 7-8 hours of use each day. I use them nearly all day during work. They charge really quickly too, which is great.

FUNCTIONS:
They have a standard pause/play/skip/answer/hang-up middle button, as well as volume up and down buttons. You can skip and rewind by holding the volume buttons.

They can also be paired with Sony's headphone app which allows you to change the EQ settings for these and have them sound how you want. There aren't a ton of sliders for the EQ, but enough for most people to customize their sound to their liking. There's also a fun custom EQ feature in the app that asks you to pick your favorite sound profile from various examples and builds you a custom EQ profile based on your taste.

The microphone on these are pretty good for headphones. They sound better than average in terms of headphone mics, but they don't sound nearly as good as the iPhone 15's built-in microphone. But if you need these for a quick phone call or video call, they work great. They can't fold up in any way but the ear cups can swivel up. So if you take them off your head and swivel them to hang around your neck, the ear pads will face up; which isn't good nor bad, just something to keep in mind.

EXERCISE:
If you're the type to use headphones rather than earphones when exercising, these would probably suffice. They are breathable and lightweight, while also having a decent clamping force to stay on your head. If i shake my head vigorously though, they inevitably fall off. The earpads are a faux-leather so they're very easy to wipe off and clean. Although, I'm typically the type of person to use earphones while exercising. The most extensive exercise I've done with these headphones is skateboard with them, but as soon as I start jumping around to do any tricks, they start to slide off my head. They should do fine with typical gym exercises movements though, they won't slide off if you're looking down.

NOISE CANCELLATION:
In terms of noise cancellation, they are decent. They obviously don't have any active noise cancelling features, but passively, they block a bit of noise, maybe 10-12 dB or so. They aren't going to blow your mind though in terms of noise cancellation. However, if you have music playing at around 40-50% volume, they block out a considerable amount of outside noise like most headphones do. I can walk through busy downtown streets with these and not hear much at all if I have music going. They'll definitely block out a considerable amount of noise in an office, cafe, train ride, etc. so long as you're actually listening to something.

BUILD QUALITY:
These headphones are built surprisingly well. The materials are obviously cheap, but they don't feel like it. The plastic is lightweight, but solid at the same time. The earpads and headband padding are both the same faux-leather, which is a bit stiff at first but softens up over time. The padding feels like it will last a long time simply because of its synthetic nature.

DESIGN:
Taste in the way these are designed is obviously subjective, but I think these look great. They have a modern, but more timeless design. They don't look super retro, but they don't look super modern either. They just look like clean, standard headphones that will look great for years. I love how the Sony logo is faintly placed on one side of the headband. It's there, but not obnoxious."

It offers a good backup battery. It sounds fantastic as well. Adaptable to fit different head sizes. The product is hybrid. Both wired and wireless connections are supported. If your battery runs out, you can use the wire to keep using it.
There is only one issue that I have observed, and that is sweating during the summer.; I have got the black color for me. Battery backup is too good and you can use with aux cable to reserve battery. Sound quality is okay but in higher volume, sound leaks and anyone near you can hear clearly. Noise cancellation is almost none, and call quality is ok(dual pairing is available so if you receive a call on phone and on your pc some video was playing it will get paused automatically , but the problem is call quality gets seriously degraded if you turn on the video - call will get garbled and you wouldn't be able to understand a single word of the person you are talking to. ear sponge quality is ok , you get one on head , and get ready to have sweaty ears in long session. Sponge can be connected again using thin spoon if they get open from the ear cup. Random disconnection is here and there and there is some minor delay - mind it if you are planning to use as gaming headphone , singleplayer is ok but not for multiplayer. biggest drawback is there is no system to fold the earcups. overall good budget headphone.; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition. Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad. It is not good for gaming. For gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.
Thank you for reading just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.; Sound quality and battery is very good.
Price is aslo good, but product is not durable for long time... Maybe product will not work after 12 month.; Sound great,price affordable,mic quality ok hai, connectivity quickly response karta hai, plastick body hai ok hai , comfortable hai per halka sweat aata hai near ear; I bought this product about 2.5 months back, My purpose of buying this headphone is to watch lectures, binge watching of movies I was wondering for budget friendly headphone under rupees 1,000.

So, After using this product for about 2.5 months and still using it. I would like to share the likes and dislikes of this product based on my usage.

Likes :
1) Sound quality is good and crisp great for listening lectures and watching movies and other content.
2) Battery life is also good it gives output of about 15 hours my daily usage is about 4-5 hours.
3) Bluetooth range is quite good for this budget.

Dislikes :
1) It's leather quality is very bad not satisfied with its quality to the leather was ripped out within just 2 months.
2) the plastic quality is not so good you can get scratches on its body easily.
3) it consumes more time to get charge it takes around 3-4 hours for 100% charging.
4) the glue used in this headphones cushion are not applied properly it comes out of the body within 1 month only.
5) the noise cancellation is not good you can easily hear outdoor activities sound Even at full volume.

Based on this budget it's a good product from Indian Brands Zebronics but comes with a lot of comprises.

If you really want quality good headphones atleast go for budget higher than rupees 2,500 or select other brands like sony, boat and other brands.; The quality is good and and sound was low because my right side not working and some small defective but product was good üëç; The product is good but they are faking too much by telling there's ENC and Gaming mode while there's no feature like that, it's just a normal Bluetooth headphone. However portability is good, comfort is good durability i would say cheap it can break easily also aux cable is not durable, sound quality good for this price range."

Final Remarks: It is a decent product as a whole within this price segment and can give you a commendable experience.; I recently purchased the boAt Rockerz 450 Bluetooth On-Ear Headphones, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed with the overall experience.

Firstly, let's talk about the packaging - it's sleek and well-designed, setting the stage for what's to come. Setting up the headphones was a breeze; connecting to Bluetooth was as simple as a few taps on my device, and I was ready to go in no time.

Now, onto the sound quality - it's fantastic. The 40mm drivers deliver crisp, clear audio across a range of frequencies, making for an immersive listening experience. Whether I'm enjoying music, watching videos, or taking calls, the sound is consistently top-notch.

Speaking of calls, the integrated mic performs admirably. It captures my voice clearly, ensuring smooth communication without any hiccups. And being wireless, I appreciate the freedom it offers - no tangled cords or restricted movements.

Design-wise, the boAt Rockerz 450 doesn't disappoint. The luscious black color scheme exudes sophistication, while the padded ear cushions provide comfort even during extended use. It's a stylish accessory that complements any outfit or setting.

Battery life is another highlight. Straight out of the box, the headphones were fully charged, ready to deliver up to 15 hours of playback on a single charge. The charging process is straightforward, ensuring that I'm never caught off guard by a dead battery.

Overall, the boAt Rockerz 450 Bluetooth On-Ear Headphones exceed expectations on all fronts. With impressive sound quality, convenient wireless connectivity, and a sleek design, they're a must-have for any music lover or tech enthusiast. Whether you're using them with your PC or on the go, these headphones deliver an exceptional audio experience that's hard to beat. Highly recommended.; At this price this is a very good purchase.
The biggest pros is its sound qaulity is amazing
And the biggest con is the fitting of the headphone is such that both earpieces are pushing my both ears towards center. The fitting is thumbs down but still a good purchase.; The boAt Rockerz line is boAt's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.

1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.
2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.
3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.
5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.
4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?

Overall good product bought at Rs 999; I have brought just one month back but Mike is not working of left earbuds and tried to called to customer care but they kept on hold for 15 mins and then cut the call, no response and no call back.

Although they took all details first and later kept on hold to check the internal issue, told me that technical team will connect and resolve my issue but later disconnected.; Pros:
Fpods are extremely good for this price(‚Çπ999) and feature like volume control sensor in the airpods itself.

Call clarity is clear and it fits in ears nicely.

The most brilliant feature is the battery. I've bought it at least a week back and have been using it very frequently and watched at least 2 movies and the battery just reduced to 70%

Haven't had these qualities with the product that costs around 2.5k

Cons:
I feel the sound quality is bit low comparatively. Few vidoes/audios require more volume than usual to hear it normally.

Sometimes the Bluetooth is getting interrupted for no reason even if the device is within range.

Besides these cons, this product is absolutely a great economical 'good to go' one for sure.

P.S. May have to review the above post a long term usageüòÅ; This earbud üéß is very nice üëç

Liked the place where buttons configured on the left cup and looks premium. Grey and golden makes it classy. Audio jack included and connects well. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.
Thank you very much,
Your customer Armaan."

And for audio volume level, It gives hearable sound in just 18% of computer audio and when i increase audio upto 100 i can hear even the base from 40cm far from the headphones.
As for comfort The cushions are really good, i was able to keep it on ears for 3hrs but not more than that cause it mae my head feel dizzy cause of hearing all my favourate melodies, old school, hip hop, rap and metal songs all at once LOL, But like other headphones i bought this one is stiff and feels like it will break if pressurised to stretch .
As for looks I love the RGB and the grill metal look it gives is DOPE along with plastic matte cover. It is quiet big like having two black and glowing eggs attached to ears but its worth cause the big egg things has lot of BASS inside LOL.
The battery life is incredible, I have been using it since yesterday and it still have 50% battery left.
ONLY PROBLEM is that I found the audio has sharp voice somewhat maximised to keep up with that heavy bass, like when you hear a song you will hear the vocals in sharp voice which is not actually pleasant. I counter this problem by using an equilizer in phone and laptop by decreasing the 14 KHz to some level and increasing 910 Hz to some level. And it only happens in bluetooth mode, The aux is perfect though.
Apart from all this I love my new headphone, Zebronics done a fabulous job by making it and selling it in such an affordable price.; "

The battery is very good but the charging cable is very short in length.
Built quality is very good feels premium. It's quite smaller than expected and I faced but fitting issue it's quite loose on my head
Connectivity is very fast & Dual Pairing.

Overall I'm satisfied because these days good headphones at affordable range rarely exist. This headphone completes my need of a portable and folding headphone with long lasting battery. The only issue which I found is the sound leakage rest is fine.; I've been using these headphones for a while now. The build quality is excellent and they're definitely not as heavy as some of the other reviews suggest. They're a little tighter around the ears, but that's not a problem for me. It helps with the passive noise cancellation, which is cool. The sound quality is quite good, and listening to music on these is a lot of fun. You can tweak the sound using several equalizers in the app. Keep tweaking until you find what works best for you. These headphones can also be used to consume media other than music, such as videos. The headphones come with Bluetooth 5.0 and AUX support in case you run out of battery. So far, I haven't had any problems with the connection. It's stable and works well when you move around a bit. The battery is the best thing about this product. It easily lasts well over a week on one charge, which is great because I use it every day. So far, I've been really pleased with this product. They're a little pricey, but they're definitely worth it!; The fit is good. Sound quality is outstanding also build quality is premium very comfortable.; These are absolute steal in this price! The design, colour, sound quality and battery life are amazing. The battery life is actually super amazing! I use them for 5 hours straight and the battery doesn't even drop down 1% which is mind boggling. For someone like me who listens to music for long hours, the battery life is a blessing. My head is a little sensitive so it starts hurting though, otherwise I can wear them for 10 hours straight. I got these on 11th May and Today is 18th may. I recieved them at 40% that I have charged them only once till 80% and used them continuosly everyday. I still have that 80% battery left. The colour is beautiful. The sound quality is really nice for the price range. Better than Boat ones for sure! The bass and the treble is perfect. The music feels heavenly at 80% volume. Even though the body is plastic, it feels premium. I was doubtful about this colour due to lack of photos and reviews but I am super glad I went for these, they look classy! Calling is also much better than the boat ones I had earlier. All-in-all, you will not be disappointed after using these.; Fast charging and long-lasting for me cuz I dont use it continuously all day
Sound wise its good
Quality of the product top notch. Came with dust bag,2 types of charges cable and leather quality is sooo goood and soft and it doesn't affect the ears but it will if u gonna use for a long time like any headphone does .
Calls -I dont think its good, the other person can hear you only if there is no distractions like fan and background noises and ull hear all the background noise when ur listening to songs.
So I think there is more options out there for this price so look for other options.; After using completely for 2 days (only removing it for sleep), i can say that sound quality is really good, the sound mixing is good and the overall sound feels dynamic but it causes pain after an hour or two. Then, there is significant sound leakage when the volume is above 80.

i was listening to music, when my parents was sleeping, they literally woke up due to sound leakage from the headphone. To give perspective, when the headphone is listened on max volume, outside people can hear it as sound 20 or 30. This is bad....

So buy this if u want an good looking headphone with good sound output but remember the cons: heavy, can't wear it for long hours, sound leakage

i am thinking of returning it.. to get a over the ear headphones; ; Buenos aud√≠fonos, calidad en el sonido y en el volumen. Por el tipo de aud√≠fono no ofrece un aislamiento completo del ruido pero la esponja hace muy bien su trabajo para camcelqr sobresalientemente el ruido exterior.
Una ventaja es que son Muy ligeros y c√≥modos por lo que puedes usarlos durante mucho tiempo si. Que sean molestos por el peso o que lastimen la cabeza y orejas.

La mayor ventaja que le veo es el aplicaci√≥n que se puede descargar para configurar el tipo ecualuzacion que se desea dependiendo del g√©nero.; The bass boost on these are crazy. They do cinch to your head nicely where they won't fall off so easily like other headphones I've had. They charge pretty fast and the battery life for me last a while because I'm a music fan so I love to listen to music for hours on end. I think it's a good value I wish they were a little bit cheaper but they are definitely a good deal and they do go wherever you go bluetooth availability and it also has an aux cord just in case. I love them. And the color is a plus as well also the cushioning on the ear portion is soft it does get a little sweaty though. Also they are very loud which I love as well and they are noise canceling.; I have been a fan of Anker cords so when I found nd myself looking for a set of headphones, these stood out to me. the reviews were good, the battery life promise kind of hooked me and so I thought I'd give them a shot. I was not disappointed! The sound is amazing compared to ones I have used before. The ear pads are smaller than full coverage so they aren't the best for noise cancelling (but somewhat). They connected very easily and feel nice on my ears. The battery life is amazing. I have charged them in the week or so since I got them but only because of habit (my old ones could barely go a day).
The one problem I have with them is they feel wide and big on my head and I wish I could make the adjustable band a bit smaller to be more snug on my head. I just have a small head so if you have a large one, great, lol!
Anyway, I'm impressed and hope they last me for a long time to come.; Der Klang dieses Kopfh√∂rers ist gut - aber auch nicht mehr. Es fehlt etwas an Klarheit, daf√ºr ist die Lautst√§rke sehr gut und der Bass abartig - und f√ºr mein Empfinden viel zu viel wenn man den Bass-Boost aktiviert. Der Tragekomfort ist ok, wenngleich dieser Kopfh√∂rer schon deutlich auf die Ohren dr√ºckt. Die Bluetooth Verbindung und Reichweite ist tadellos, die Akku-Laufzeit exzellent.
Das Beste aber an dem Kopfh√∂rer ist das wirklich exzellente Preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis: All das um nur EUR 20.- ist nat√ºrlich der Hammer - deswegen trotz der angef√ºhrten Mankos 5 Sterne.; Amazing quality, amazing sound, beautiful clear microphones, lovely bass, unmatched battery life, fits well and easy to setup, as an audiophile who has owned over 20 pairs of headphones, at this price point, they are unmatched, with an amazing free app that syncs your equaliser settings between devices"

Here are the key highlights that make these earphones a fantastic choice:

**Exceptional Sound Quality:** The Bombastic Bass is truly remarkable. Whether I'm listening to music or watching videos, the sound is rich and immersive. The audio clarity and depth are excellent, making every listening experience enjoyable.

**Fast Charging:** The fast charging feature is a game-changer. With just 10 minutes of charge, I get 20 hours of music playback. This is incredibly convenient for someone with a busy schedule. I never have to worry about running out of battery.

**Long Battery Life:** The 30-hour battery life on a full charge is outstanding. I can use the earphones for extended periods without needing to recharge frequently. This makes them perfect for long trips, workouts, and daily commutes.

**Comfortable Fit:** The in-ear design is comfortable and secure. The earphones stay in place even during rigorous activities, and I don't experience any discomfort even after prolonged use.

**Easy Connectivity:** Pairing the earphones with my devices is quick and hassle-free, thanks to Bluetooth 5.0. The connection remains stable, and I haven't encountered any dropouts or lag.

**Built-in Mic:** The built-in mic ensures clear and crisp call quality. It's great for hands-free calls, and the voice clarity is impressive.

**Stylish Design:** The Acoustic Red color is vibrant and stylish. The design is sleek and modern, adding a touch of elegance to my tech accessories.

Overall, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless In-Ear Earphones offer exceptional value for money. They combine excellent sound quality, fast charging, long battery life, and a comfortable fit in a stylish package. I highly recommend these earphones to anyone looking for a high-quality audio experience.; There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.

The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.
Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.

You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.

As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand‚Äôs audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.
If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.

That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.

They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.
The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.; One plus bullet is worth for money. Sound quality is amazing with clear voice feature. Design n material of product is worthy üôå. And got at best of it's price...so definitely no complaint at all.; Been using the Z series past 4 years was quiet satisfied but i was bit spectical about the Z2 ANC in terms of ear fitment and noise cancellation to my suprise its working too good and satisfied with the product and the cost price.; Sound is good everything is alright provided it is hard many times to connect neckband from Bluetooth,either I have to off it or forgot it and pair it again.
Product is of good quality, comfortable in ears and can use easily while doing other activities,battery is okay.Only problem is to connect it from android phone.; I bought this one because of the ANC, and i am quite impressed with the noice cancellation. Eartips are small though but not a problem i can buy it seperately. I was not expecting the sound quality because I use iem earphone as well but the sound quality is quite impressive, best for music like edm mix. Bass is impressive also. Not for music like classical but other than that it is good to listen other genres of music. Connectivity is quite fast and easy and switching between devices as well. Satisfied with battery life as well.; I charge it once a week and it works effortlessly. It‚Äôs very comfortable to use and the neck band is adjustable. I like the quality of sound and would recommend it. I use iPhone and it pairs perfect with it.; Good battery, good sound , call quality nice , gaming not good ,look ok.; The sound quality is very good. The battery life is outstanding. Best of all though is when you click the buds together with their magnets they turn off. Pull them apart and they turn back on. No button to fiddle with. All buds should be like this.; This brand is recognized becaus of the quality of its products and this item is not the exception. perfect for sports and outdoors activities.; La puntualidad, presentaci√≥n me gust√≥ much√≠simo; Good quality, little bigger the end of the neck band because of a bigger battery. Sound and noise cancelation better than previous model. Ear tips smaller and lighter, for me hold really good even running, better bass and treble.; Precis vad jag s√∂kte efter"

As for comfort The cushions are really good, i was able to keep it on ears for 3hrs but not more than that cause it mae my head feel dizzy cause of hearing all my favourate melodies, old school, hip hop, rap and metal songs all at once LOL, But like other headphones i bought this one is stiff and feels like it will break if pressurised to stretch .
As for looks I love the RGB and the grill metal look it gives is DOPE along with plastic matte cover. It is quiet big like having two black and glowing eggs attached to ears but its worth cause the big egg things has lot of BASS inside LOL.
The battery life is incredible, I have been using it since yesterday and it still have 50% battery left.
ONLY PROBLEM is that I found the audio has sharp voice somewhat maximised to keep up with that heavy bass, like when you hear a song you will hear the vocals in sharp voice which is not actually pleasant. I counter this problem by using an equilizer in phone and laptop by decreasing the 14 KHz to some level and increasing 910 Hz to some level. And it only happens in bluetooth mode, The aux is perfect though.
Apart from all this I love my new headphone, Zebronics done a fabulous job by making it and selling it in such an affordable price.; "

So I had with 0 expectations reading the reviews I got it for a good price at 2800 so i just went for it.
At first when I got the headphones I was dissapointed when I heard coz I put max volume on my phone nd the bass nd sound was low BUT THATS THE MISTAKE I THINK MOST PPL PUTTING THE REVIEWS COZ THATS DEFAULT SOUND which is very low
You will have to put a song or play video it won't work otherwise AND THEN MANUALLY INCREASE THE SOUND BY CLICKING THE VOLUME BUTTONS ON THE HEADPHONES TILL U HERE A SOUND TICK SOUND WHICH MEANS IT REACHED MAX VOLUME.
I did not know this I just found it and UFF the sound and bass increased SIGNIFICANLTY.
SO REMEMBER TO DO THIS THIS WHEN U BUY THE HEADPHONES
After doing that And you still want even more bass and sound then idk do you want ur head to explode or somethin coz it has VERY LOUD AND GOOD SOUND AND BASS!!
OH Yes it's comfortable too not for too long but enough time life 5 or 6 hrs IF u have big ears it might hurt after sometime but for me it's PERFECT.; I have been using the headphones (TUNE 760) for more than a month, here is my review

At first (2 days of purchasing) I was very disappointed because I felt that the sound quality was very lacking, the base and loudness disappointed me, but after a week, it started to sound very very good, I think it needed a burn period, because this headphone is now sounding very very good for me.

Build Quality - the build quality is good, no major issues, the pad is soft.

Comfort - the headphone is comfortable, but one issue is that the clamping force is a bit tight, maybe because I have a big head. Another thing is, even though this is an over read headphone it is not that big, so some part of my ear gets a bit uncomfortable after long use, but if u adjust and find the correct comfortable position, you cab wear it for a long time, I watched a 3 hr movie without any issues

Battery - omg, one of the best part of this headphone, claims 50 hr without noise cancellation, I think it lives upto the mark. You don't have to worry about battery

Sound quality - I'm not an audiophile, let me clear it up. The sound quality I felt was really good and I was very impressed, after the burn in period, so if you are buying this give it at least 1 week before judging it, trust me it really really gets better. The base was not that high, but not lacking also, was upto the mark.

Noise cancellation - it wasn't really that great, could slightly reduce the fan noise that's it, I wouldn't say it is useless, but not that bad either, could reduce the noise of tv from next room when I listened to music, so it did came in handy also with noise cancellation the sound quality I felt improved a bit.

Conclusion - as I said, I was really disappointed at first with the purchase, thought I wasted the money(6.5k) but now I'm really really enjoyed it, watching movies was the best experience with dolby music profile in my phone. I'd say it is really worth the money if ur looking for a headphone around 7k; Pros: good sturdy build and good connectivity and battery life, and aesthetically looks good on you. Active Noise Cancelling is great too.

Cons (likely):

* Charging port doesn't allow for using while charging. I had this in my last headphones (non-brand, cheaper!) and it's so convenient that you miss it and curse whoever is lacking behind in this basic feature. But the good battery backup leaves you plenty time to recharge.

* Too tight. Again, a basic feature IMO to make it feather light which again, a lot of cheaper non-brand headphones are offering, such a shame to see it lacking too. Ears will get hot even in winter/AC. But great if you're a runner, they won't come off.

* Multipoint connection is better than others as it allows you to fully switch between two devices rather divide the audio between calling and music mode. BUT again, the only downside (that maybe only I'm seeing on my Windows PC) that when I switch away from it to my phone, my pc gets entirely disconnected (unlike Android that puts the connection on standby) and I have to re-connect from windows after switching back to it.

* Very little bass. And I feel like ANC might me filtering some of it out, especially at large volume, as the most bass I get at is weirdly at ~80% volume.

Verdict: Well budgeted ANC headphones with lots of good features.; battery and durability -amazing,
sound quality and comfort -great,
noise cancellation -okayish,
mic quality -absolute trash.

all the other reviews speak about the sound quality. it's great in that aspect. nothing special to comment about

These headphones are super tough and last a long time, which is awesome. One thing though, you can't use them while charging, like the Apple mouse. But hey, they charge crazy fast ‚Äì 30-40% in a few minutes, and fully in just 1.5 hours. So, even though you can't use them while charging, you'll be back to wireless mode pretty quickly.

the headphones seem to not have enough processing power to provide good mic quality alongside good sound quality. and when you turn on noise cancelling the mic quality gets even worse. I can't attend calls when im outside, the mic pics up too much noise.

They boot up in noise-canceling mode, which can be useful but drains the battery unnecessarily when not needed. Additionally, they don't automatically power down if noise-cancelling remains active, leading to overnight battery depletion.; Item is good but bass is not as per jbl quality. Further, ear comfort is less. Thank you; These headphones have saved me with the outside disturbance. I purchased it because of Noise cancellation and easy usage. Headphones look classy and the sound quality is amazing. It has both Bluetooth and wired connectivity which comes in handy. Buttons are very helpful to switch from non-NC to NC and even change to next or previous collection. Mic quality works without any disturbance.. Warranty is provided and value for the price range.; A bateria dura muito para carregar ela t√° amando,

It offers a good backup battery. It sounds fantastic as well. Adaptable to fit different head sizes. The product is hybrid. Both wired and wireless connections are supported. If your battery runs out, you can use the wire to keep using it.
There is only one issue that I have observed, and that is sweating during the summer.; I have got the black color for me. Battery backup is too good and you can use with aux cable to reserve battery. Sound quality is okay but in higher volume, sound leaks and anyone near you can hear clearly. Noise cancellation is almost none, and call quality is ok(dual pairing is available so if you receive a call on phone and on your pc some video was playing it will get paused automatically , but the problem is call quality gets seriously degraded if you turn on the video - call will get garbled and you wouldn't be able to understand a single word of the person you are talking to. ear sponge quality is ok , you get one on head , and get ready to have sweaty ears in long session. Sponge can be connected again using thin spoon if they get open from the ear cup. Random disconnection is here and there and there is some minor delay - mind it if you are planning to use as gaming headphone , singleplayer is ok but not for multiplayer. biggest drawback is there is no system to fold the earcups. overall good budget headphone.; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition. Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad. It is not good for gaming. For gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.
Thank you for reading just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.; Sound quality and battery is very good.
Price is aslo good, but product is not durable for long time... Maybe product will not work after 12 month.; Sound great,price affordable,mic quality ok hai, connectivity quickly response karta hai, plastick body hai ok hai , comfortable hai per halka sweat aata hai near ear; I bought this product about 2.5 months back, My purpose of buying this headphone is to watch lectures, binge watching of movies I was wondering for budget friendly headphone under rupees 1,000.

So, After using this product for about 2.5 months and still using it. I would like to share the likes and dislikes of this product based on my usage.

Likes :
1) Sound quality is good and crisp great for listening lectures and watching movies and other content.
2) Battery life is also good it gives output of about 15 hours my daily usage is about 4-5 hours.
3) Bluetooth range is quite good for this budget.

Dislikes :
1) It's leather quality is very bad not satisfied with its quality to the leather was ripped out within just 2 months.
2) the plastic quality is not so good you can get scratches on its body easily.
3) it consumes more time to get charge it takes around 3-4 hours for 100% charging.
4) the glue used in this headphones cushion are not applied properly it comes out of the body within 1 month only.
5) the noise cancellation is not good you can easily hear outdoor activities sound Even at full volume.

Based on this budget it's a good product from Indian Brands Zebronics but comes with a lot of comprises.

If you really want quality good headphones atleast go for budget higher than rupees 2,500 or select other brands like sony, boat and other brands.; The quality is good and and sound was low because my right side not working and some small defective but product was good üëç; The product is good but they are faking too much by telling there's ENC and Gaming mode while there's no feature like that, it's just a normal Bluetooth headphone. However portability is good, comfort is good durability i would say cheap it can break easily also aux cable is not durable, sound quality good for this price range."

I bought 2 pieces of it ....; Whenever I buy something online I spend a lot of time researching the pros and cons of the product. Before buying Noise Three I compared it with almost every other product in the price range of 2000 and it was looking promising. The only problem is the Auxiliary mode which doesn't seem to work properly in my case. The 3.5 mm cables are not working properly as only the left side produces audio but distortedly. Even though the headset provides a jack for 4mm drivers Noise decided to ship 3.5mm drivers instead -- what a shame! Some notable points:
- The cushions are soft. I have big ears and surprisingly it fits my ears completely :)
- It doesn't give room for people with a turban or a scarf on their head. It is a little restrictive in terms of being wide.
- Your ears will sweat if you wear it for as little as 1 hour.
- The plastic quality looks durable and has a smooth matt finish too.
- The buttons have a nice light click to them.
- It looks and feels premium at this price range.
- The mic audio for calling is not very clear. IT WORKS FINE though
- The Bluetooth range is decent too; Good quality,good bass, good sound quality
One of the most remarkable features battery backup overall nice product; The cushion quality is ok.not too good.
Sound is good
Looks is decent
Features and specifications are awesome; Overall sound quality is gud has a base enriched sound but has some serious connectivity issue like keeps disconnecting, I've exchanged the device previous one gets disconnected and turned off but this one just sometimes or manytimes keeps disconnecting if u r oky with this then go for it.; Amazing battery backup ... the quality of this headphones is bang on. I already have JBL 760 headphones worth 7k and I would say this product is a dupe of it. It totally worth buying.; Connectivity best
Light weight, easy to wear and carry
Noise cancellation better but not the best
Build quality greatest
appearance.... Nice good looking for budget headphone...... Easy to attend online classes for students
Sound quality is up to the mark..... Bass is loud as I am bass lover It is killer headphone for me....
Vocals and treble is better...... All rounder performance.... ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞; Built quality is really good and it‚Äôs also comfortable so you can wear it for longer time but sound it could be batter. If we connect it to 2 devices then other device keeps getting disconnected which ruins overall experience."

It'd been 10 days, it didn't discharged to zero. Although I tried charging it..so it went very fast. Amazing Noise Cancellation .It has Bluetooth connectivity with multiple devices and also got ox cable for wired connectivity. I highly recommend it, if you want to spend monet on great wireless headphone.; 1,Appearances is good, good fit perfect balanced weight goes smooth and easy over the ears. But too much or usage might get little warmth but that‚Äôs okay I must say.
2. Value for money : yes sounds good clear voice and all instruments but can‚Äôt expect too loud sound and heavy bass. Because it‚Äôs simply not designed for heavy musics.
3.connectivity it‚Äôs very much better in this devise. Well I‚Äôve seen some connection drops in the darker area (I.e phones in pocket, phone in the bag or in the glove box of a car) but not too bad I must say, it fights really hard and good to maintain good connection.
4.build quality & attention: build quality is fair I can say a bit of mettle and major combination of soft plastic and cushion makes it light and strong. And yes people will look at what your wearing they show some good attention.

Conclusion :Just had this gig for some days that‚Äôs all . So far so good I can say. But the way they build this and tech used in this it should easily last for about 2-3 years. But be sure to buy some extra warranty for 2 years or something. Because JBL are such a brand where they show the best in the day and hides the worst for the night. I‚Äôve experienced it before down the line after manufacturing warranty there will be some issues that gives you surprises. Later you wish to repair it or simply buy a new one would your hard choice to make.; I like this product for the value for money it provides. I've been using this headphone for the past week and I'm happy to report that my experience has been pleasant while using these for a person who's not a hardcore audiophile.

PROs:
(a) Comfortable over the ear fit for average ear size; headphones do not feel heavy over long use
(b) Over par, more than advertised battery life. Easily lasts a week with heavy usage and ANC turned off. And 3-4 days with moderate ANC usage.
(c) App support is amazing on android. Provides the following features:
(i) Active Noise Cancellation
(ii) Ambient Noise Aware
(iii) Talkthrough
(iv) Self voice aware volume control
(v) Equalizer support (bass, extra bass modes pre-configured - +ve experience using them)
(vi) Separate Audio and Video modes for consuming content
(d) Almost negligible noise bleed
(e) Solid build quality. Tactile buttons. Travel friendly (foldable ear cups)

Some minor CONs:
(a) ANC could be better. Not very strong ANC
(b) Button placement could be better
(c) Foam in the ear muffs is built to last and not comfy if cups lay over your ear cartilages for long duration (if you have bigger ears).
(d) dark blue colour just looks horrendously cheap in daylight as outside shell material is plastic. Go for black, white or purple (if it ever comes back in stock); The ear pads are too small .. they hurt after few minutes of usage .
There was a weird line that looks like a crack on the side of the headphones and this isn't only on my product.
The Bass of the headphones is trash as well. The headband is tight and if extended they float over the head instead of resting when extended. The build quality of the Headband is as good as the Boat771 feels like it'll snap. Overall I'd rather the Boat 751 more then the JBL 770 In terms of Bass, Comfort, vocals .. the only up this headphones got over the Boat751 is the Noise cancellation.. which isn't even that good.
These headphones aren't worth 6k at all; Pros:
+ Super audio quality pretty much at all frequency level
+ 10 meter Bluetooth range with quick pairing
+ Better microphone quality
+ Better noise cancellation
+ Super battery life
+ Companior app to adjust audio mode and equalizer
+ Appropriate packaging
+ On-time delivery

Cons:
- Little costlier; ; Everything is fine except for the crackling sound that occurs during calls üìû, which happens consistently in every call. This makes me frustrated, honestly. However, other than that, normal audio sounds good and has quality.
One point to note is that it's not suitable for people who prefer high bass audio. Also, the building quality is good considering its price. Battery-wise, I would say it provides long duration.
Connectivity is fast enough to say it fast connectivity.
And jbl app is the main hero here, without app it's not worth using.
Noise cancellation: 3 out of 5

Value for money? : ....... May be.....may be not.... Personal opinion.

Charging: 4 out of 5; The headphones fit quite well. It is apt for all kind of people. It has got great comfort in its cushions as well as it is soft and comfortable. Its appearance also feels great. Quite a great one without anything fancy. It can be folded to fit into any bags for these. Coming to the quality, it offers a great deal of high quality surround sound feel but lags behind a little bit of bass boost. It has Bluetooth v5.3 making it very much easy to connect. Software updates are available for both headphones software as well as the languages in use. The applications covers a lot of options for us to configure the device. It is a great choice if you can buy during the sales.; O fone tem uma excelente qualidade, o custo benef√≠cio vale muito. O produto √© original, seu cancelamento de ru√≠do muito bom. Uma pena que n√£o d√° pra trocar as borrachas conforme o uso pois com o tempo elas v√£o gastando. Do resto o material √© muito bom. Vale a pena; Qualidade excelente, n√£o esperava menos.
A qualidade de √°udio √© muito boa e o encaixe tamb√©m, achei muito confort√°vel e se adapta a diversos formatos de cabe√ßa, mas acho importante ressaltar que ele pode ser apertado nas orelhas e a parte de espuma n√£o √© grande o suficiente para se encaixar do jeito mais confort√°vel, o que n√£o me incomoda, mas √© algo para considerar.
Como ele se encaixa muito bem, eu posso usar em v√°rias atividades di√°rias, inclusive para me exercitar, e ele permanece fixo sem nem amea√ßar cair.
A dura√ß√£o da bateria √© extraordin√°ria e eu posso us√°-lo confortavelmente durante v√°rias horas de estudo.
Recomendo, √≥timo custo-benef√≠cio.; Vamos l√°!

muito bonito, n√£o √© muito leve e nem muito pesado, peso ideal!! O seu tamanho tamb√©m √© ideal, pois n√£o √© muito grande, ele √© dobr√°vel o que ajuda caso queira guardar na bolsa, vem com tr√™s bot√µes e a loga marca da jbl! Ele √© fosco lind√≠ssimo

em rela√ß√£o a conforto:

√ìtimo! Ele √© justo e n√£o fica folgado na cabe√ßa, mas n√£o se preocupe, n√£o √© t√£o apertado a ponta de incomodar, uso ele pra fazer muscula√ß√£o, corrida, crossfit e outros exerc√≠cios que exigem muitos movimentos, ele simplesmente n√£o sai do lugar, eu tinha essa preocupa√ß√£o, mas superou minhas expectativas.

em rela√ß√£o ao som:

Espetacular! O volume √© alto, abafa muito bem os ru√≠dos, voc√™ n√£o consegue ouvir o que as pessoas dizem ao redor, um ponto interessante dele √© que vc pode se afastar o quanto for que o fone n√£o desconecta, n√£o baixa o som ou qualquer coisa do tipo

em rela√ß√£o a bateria:

√© surreal a dura√ß√£o da bateria, estou usando h√° uma semana e ela n√£o est√° nem na metade!! Obs: uso todos os dias por volta de 2hrs a 3hrs, acredito que deve durar mais ou menos duas semanas tranquilamente

Por fim, se voc√™ busca um fone com o pre√ßo bom, com durabilidade de bateria espetacular, com som bom, voc√™ precisa comprar esse fone!!! Apenas comprem, n√£o ir√£o se arrepender; Estava h√° muito tempo buscando um fone de ouvido Bluetooth com cancelamento de ru√≠do ativo at√© 500 reais, at√© me deparar com esse da JBL. Opini√£o ap√≥s um m√™s de uso: espuma muito confort√°vel, utilizo o fone o dia todo (e uso √≥culos), se encaixa bem na cabe√ßa e n√£o tive problemas nem correndo at√© o metr√¥. Possui cabo p2 remov√≠vel, mas devido a dura√ß√£o da bateria, s√≥ usei para testar (carrego o fone uma vez a cada 2/3 dias, com uso continuo). Cancelamento de ru√≠do bom (nada excepcional, mas cumpre seu papel). Apresenta ru√≠do em trepida√ß√µes (como em trens/metr√¥), possivelmente vindo do microfone, mas nada que atrapalhe muito a experi√™ncia. Padr√£o de qualidade sonora cl√°ssica da JBL, com foco nos graves acentuados. Recomendo a compra!; Good product, so far i everything is good."

Your headset is shipped in power saver mode. The headset is only 10% charged. Failure to do so may cause connectivity issues.,"I recently purchased the Boat Neckband, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed with this wireless neckband. From its stylish design to its outstanding audio performance, it has exceeded my expectations in every way.
Design and Build:
The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek and modern design of the Boat Neckband. The combination of black and silver accents gives it a premium look, and it's incredibly lightweight, making it comfortable to wear for extended periods. The flexible neckband design ensures a secure fit around my neck, even during rigorous workouts or when I'm on the move.

Sound Quality:
The sound quality of these neckbands is nothing short of exceptional. The Boat Neckband delivers rich, clear, and well-balanced audio. The bass is punchy without overpowering the mids and highs, allowing me to enjoy a wide range of music genres with utmost clarity. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tracks or taking calls, the audio quality is consistently impressive.

Battery Life:
One of the standout features of the Boat Neckband is its impressive battery life. I can easily go through several days of moderate use on a single charge. This is incredibly convenient, as I no longer have to worry about constantly recharging them, making them perfect for long trips or days filled with back-to-back meetings.

Connectivity:
Pairing the Boat Neckband with my devices is a breeze. The Bluetooth connectivity is stable and quick, and I've had no issues with dropouts or disconnections. The device also has a decent Bluetooth range, allowing me to move around my home without losing connection quality.

Comfort and Convenience:
These neckbands are designed with comfort in mind. The earbuds fit snugly in my ears, and the neckband doesn't cause any discomfort, even during extended wear. The in-line controls are intuitive, making it easy to adjust the volume, change tracks, or take calls without reaching for my phone.

Call Quality:
The built-in microphone provides crystal-clear call quality. I've had numerous conversations, and the person on the other end has always reported that my voice comes through loud and clear, even in noisy environments.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Boat Neckband has proven to be an excellent investment. It combines style, comfort, and exceptional sound quality into one impressive package. Whether you're a music enthusiast or need a reliable hands-free calling solution, these neckbands deliver on all fronts. I wholeheartedly recommend the Boat Neckband to anyone in search of a top-notch wireless audio experience.; Noise cancellation ok, battery is good, sound quality ok, ok; Not worth for money. Can't hear clear sound and base; The two device pairing and simultaneous use on both the devices is a great feature when you don't want to constantly change devices using button or something. The sound quality is also excellent for the price. There are still two things that bother me. The feature of magnetic bus is kinda a gimmic, it doesn't turn the earbus on or off. But the feature of two device simultaneous pairing make up for it. Sometime when I turn the earphone on it doesn't seem to connect to my phone instantly, I have to manually do it and in other cases it perfectly does that. The other thing is build quality is okay, but can't argue for the price it's good enough. Only if they used rubberised plastic instead of textured one, would've had a better feel to it.; Less battery life; Been using it since a week and they're really comfortable. I got it delivered in two days without delivery charge and it's worth spending ‚Çπ1000 on. It's quality is really good. It has great battery life too since I noticed that it charged up in an hour and works for like 30 minutes with no disturbance.; A very good neckband with good sound quality and connectivity is also good.; This is so good but not well"

I would like to share my experience: the sound quality is highly impressive, delivering clear and marvelous audio performance. Their comfortable fit and long battery life make them ideal for use over 2-3 days. The charging case is convenient to carry and is a great addition; it seems they're always ready to go...; Its is not getting charged. When i tried returning the product, it is not possible. We can only call the technician. The technician said like, i need to contact the service centre to replace the product. But when i checked, in chennai there is no service centre available. The only one in tnagar is also closed. I recommed u all to not buy this cheap product since i lost Rs.2700 for a product which i can't use at all.; I've been using the Skullcandy Smokin Buds TWS for my daily workouts and they're been a game-changer.

Plus, the battery life is amazing ‚Äì I can get up to 20 hours of use on a single charge.; I have been using it for almost a month now. The product feels good but lacks upto date tech, it does not have ANC which is a big minus point. The build quality of charging case and earbuds are good. Sound quality could have been much better, voice notes are good but lacks good bass. Charging speed and battery capacity is great. Overall it's a good product but it has a room for a whole lot more.; Dont buy skullcandy product their customer service is worst. I have a reason to say this
I got defected product when i claim the warranty i submit my product to their service centre and its been 20 days then haven't replaced my product yet.
I recommend not to buy skullcandy product.
Even i dont know how much time they take to replace my product; The sound performance if these buds are commendable. Music, movie watching, podcasts and what not...
However, for calling purpose this would be an utter failure. Watch out before buying.
Also, Amazon return policy is really tricky. You cannot return if you are unsatisfied with your item. You can return only if defective or damaged.; I'm always skeptical of budget earbuds, but the Skullcandy Smokin Buds TWS have proven me wrong. They're incredibly affordable, but they don't skimp on quality. The sound quality is great, the fit is comfortable, and the battery life is impressive; I'll fitting in ear, keeps on dropping on floor, even with the largest size.
Previos OnePlus headset was good fiiting. Don't know what the company thinks about the products they make.
Bad product. I m sure it will fall off and I have to buy new one. Waste of money; Bonitos aud√≠fonos, buen precio.Mis primeros aud√≠fonos de este precio y me gust√≥ mucho el sonido. Fue muy f√°cil vincularlos a mi tel√©fono y despu√©s solo hay que meterlos en los o√≠dos e inmediatamente se conectan, esto tambi√©n me gust√≥ mucho, porque los aud√≠fonos baratos, qu√© antes usaba, tardaban mucho tiempo para conectarse y algunas veces ten√≠a que desemparejarlos. Con estos aud√≠fonos no existe √©ste problema.; I absolutely love these! They are a great quality for the price. The battery life is excellent and it‚Äôs super easy to connect to your device.

These fit in my small ears really well which is always the most challenging thign about finding earbuds. They are comfortable. The case is nice. I had no issues connecting them to my phone and they don't have issues using a single earbud like my old ones sometimes did. Sound seems fine especially for $30.

It offers a good backup battery. It sounds fantastic as well. Adaptable to fit different head sizes. The product is hybrid. Both wired and wireless connections are supported. If your battery runs out, you can use the wire to keep using it.
There is only one issue that I have observed, and that is sweating during the summer.; I have got the black color for me. Battery backup is too good and you can use with aux cable to reserve battery. Sound quality is okay but in higher volume, sound leaks and anyone near you can hear clearly. Noise cancellation is almost none, and call quality is ok(dual pairing is available so if you receive a call on phone and on your pc some video was playing it will get paused automatically , but the problem is call quality gets seriously degraded if you turn on the video - call will get garbled and you wouldn't be able to understand a single word of the person you are talking to. ear sponge quality is ok , you get one on head , and get ready to have sweaty ears in long session. Sponge can be connected again using thin spoon if they get open from the ear cup. Random disconnection is here and there and there is some minor delay - mind it if you are planning to use as gaming headphone , singleplayer is ok but not for multiplayer. biggest drawback is there is no system to fold the earcups. overall good budget headphone.; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition. Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad. It is not good for gaming. For gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.
Thank you for reading just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.; Sound quality and battery is very good.
Price is aslo good, but product is not durable for long time... Maybe product will not work after 12 month.; Sound great,price affordable,mic quality ok hai, connectivity quickly response karta hai, plastick body hai ok hai , comfortable hai per halka sweat aata hai near ear; I bought this product about 2.5 months back, My purpose of buying this headphone is to watch lectures, binge watching of movies I was wondering for budget friendly headphone under rupees 1,000.

So, After using this product for about 2.5 months and still using it. I would like to share the likes and dislikes of this product based on my usage.

Likes :
1) Sound quality is good and crisp great for listening lectures and watching movies and other content.
2) Battery life is also good it gives output of about 15 hours my daily usage is about 4-5 hours.
3) Bluetooth range is quite good for this budget.

Dislikes :
1) It's leather quality is very bad not satisfied with its quality to the leather was ripped out within just 2 months.
2) the plastic quality is not so good you can get scratches on its body easily.
3) it consumes more time to get charge it takes around 3-4 hours for 100% charging.
4) the glue used in this headphones cushion are not applied properly it comes out of the body within 1 month only.
5) the noise cancellation is not good you can easily hear outdoor activities sound Even at full volume.

Based on this budget it's a good product from Indian Brands Zebronics but comes with a lot of comprises.

If you really want quality good headphones atleast go for budget higher than rupees 2,500 or select other brands like sony, boat and other brands.; The quality is good and and sound was low because my right side not working and some small defective but product was good üëç; The product is good but they are faking too much by telling there's ENC and Gaming mode while there's no feature like that, it's just a normal Bluetooth headphone. However portability is good, comfort is good durability i would say cheap it can break easily also aux cable is not durable, sound quality good for this price range."

‚Ä¢ sound quality is decent, there is ANC (active noise cancellation) which isn't really good, you will be disappointed if you bought it for noice cancellation, it does supress a little external sound but not even remotely impressive

‚Ä¢ It looks beautiful, mine is black, although it doesn't seem very durable, now i am confident i can take great care of it, but if you aren't careful then it might end up breaking within first few months of purchase.

‚Ä¢ Ambient mode is extremely helpful during functions or any event where you need to be attentive, maybe someone is calling you or something else, so using Ambient mode you can hear external sound more clearly

‚Ä¢ One of the main reason i bought it is because of the battery, and it didn't disappoint, absolute monster when it comes to battery, you can use it for 6 hours continuously and only 10%-5% battery will be consumed.

‚Ä¢ It is also extremely comfortable and covers your ears really well, it's foldable but again handle with care, it doesn't seem very durable, modes such as signature sound makes the listening phenomenal.

‚Ä¢ Gaming - now i didn't expect it to perform this well in terms of gaming but i was surprised, while they didn't mention anything about gaming experience, it did perform very well, games checked - (PUBG, Terraria, COD, Dead Cells, Little Nightmare).; I got these for RS. 1500 and let me tell you that for the price they're amazing.

The sound quality is great due to its 50mm drivers, the bass is very loud and you'll be able to feel that thump of the bass.

The reason I keep telling that they're good FOR THE PRICE is that the build quality is not very good, it's made of plastic which is good enough. The hinges and very low quality. My Left hinge broke after around a one and a half year of use.

But if you look at the prize and the things you get it's worth it. I have other expensive hyper x headphones but the bass that the Rockerz 550 give is better than them

It won't last for long but for its price it's really good, if you take extra good care of it I'm sure it'll have a long life.
The thing is even though the left hinge of my rockers 550 has broken the sound quality is still as good as the day I got them.; The built quality is good . It is comfortably and the noise cancellation is next level as it prevents all the background noise. I tried calling on it and it was pretty decent. The vocals were clear. The bass it good . wont suggests for a bass head . The only disappointment was with to vocals. They are crystal clear and sharp but not soft . Like u can consider it is suitable for hiphop songs but wont be that great for classicals. In general its good but ill suggest if ur planing to buy for vocals clearity plz search for better options. This is my persnal opinion.; I got it for 2600 rs and after one month of usage, here's my review
Pros:
1. decent audio, no complaints there
2. Transparancy mode works well
3. Noice cancelation gets rid of the the general noise, but doesn't work well when someone's talking or around constructions or loud noises. Decent for the price I would say.
4. Battery life is amazing. Better than some high end headphones.
5. It's over ear so it's decently comfortable. Ear cups are pretty soft so you can wear it for a couple of hours at a time. Your ears might get a little hot and sweaty after long usage, but it's definitely anything but uncomfortable.

Cons:
1. Durability is a big issue. For so many features at such small price, i guess they cut costs at durability. If you are a rough handler, I would suggest not to get this. One of the earpiece was roasted 180¬∞ about the joint. I had to carefully move it back into its place. It's now loose, though it is my fault, for not taking care, but for this price, the product shouldn't be this non-durable. I've seen cheaper headphones which are much more durable.

Conclusion: if you can take good care of this headphone, do go for it if it's under 3k.
It is truly value for money below 3k. If it's around 3.5k, I would suggest waiting for a price drop.; This is the only overear headphones under 8k but this has the price of 2k that are far better than tws or onear headphones in terms of ear health just go for it I have using it from 1 year any quality issues with this doesn't happen and the sound quality is also good.overear headphones do some passive noise cancellation to cut the external noise.; This product bass quality is not much batter I personally suggest that don‚Äôt buy this product if you are a bass lover or havey sound and the batter is not bad it was surviv up to 9 to 10 days and comfort is also better but squatting in side tha ear after 20 to 40 min and cussen in very soft and her quality is good not bad build quality was also batter the other headphones and one other bad think is that her charging poat is older not c type if the boat company is plat that charging poart the that was a very good think if you are buying as a use for gaming thin you can buy this this is a good product for gaming very low latency this this headphone"

The Blue color adds a touch of style, and the build quality feels durable, especially considering the affordable price point.

Built-in Microphone (4/5): The integrated microphone works well for calls, delivering clear and crisp voice quality. It's a handy feature for those who use earphones for both listening to music and taking calls on the go. While it may not be as advanced as some high-end microphones, it certainly gets the job done effectively.

Here's a breakdown of what you can expect after listening to them for a while:

Pros:

Punchy Bass: These earphones live up to the JBL name by delivering satisfying bass that makes music enjoyable, especially bass-heavy genres like hip-hop and EDM.
√ºberraschend (√ºberraschend is German for surprisingly) Clear Mids and Highs: Despite the bass focus, the mids and highs aren't totally drowned out. You can still hear vocals and instruments clearly.
Comfortable Fit: Thanks to the included ear tips in various sizes, you can find a snug fit that provides passive noise isolation and keeps the earphones securely in place.
Built-in Microphone and Remote: The one-button remote lets you control music playback and answer calls conveniently, perfect for everyday use.
Affordable Price: The JBL C50HI is a budget-friendly option, making it a good choice for those who prioritize sound quality without breaking the bank.
Cons:

Lacks Durability Concerns: Some user reviews mention concerns about the build quality, particularly regarding the cable‚Äôs longevity.
Nicht besonders (Nicht besonders is German for not particularly) Noise Cancelling: These earphones rely on a snug fit for passive noise isolation, but they won't completely block out ambient noise.
Limited Call Quality: While the microphone allows for calls, reviews suggest the microphone quality might not be the best for clear conversations in noisy environments.
Overall:

The JBL C50HI wired in-ear headphones are a solid choice for budget-minded listeners who prioritize clear sound with a punchy bass. The comfortable fit, built-in microphone, and affordable price tag add to their appeal. However, be mindful of potential durability concerns and the lack of active noise cancellation.

Recommendation:

If you're looking for a good balance of sound quality, affordability, and convenience for everyday use, the JBL C50HI is worth considering. However, if durability or crystal-clear call quality are your top priorities, you might want to explore other options.; Wires get tangle easily; Build quality is not so good. But in 600 rupees audio quality is too good. No extra base. Not for music. Prefer for gaming.; The product is of very good quality and value for money.; O fone √© bem pequeno talvez incomode algumas pessoas, mas a qualidade sonora √© excelente. √önico problema √© o bot√£o de passar m√∫sica e etc, pouco sens√≠vel, o que acaba fazendo voc√™ apertar o bot√£o mais vezes do que gostaria.; √© um fone muito bom pelo o pre√ßo. a qualidade do som √© muito boa, e √© bem alto tbm. ele abafa bastante o som externo, e a microfone √© bem proximo da boca, o som √© alto e limpo. sem chiados. perfeito.; Otimo fone, qualidade do som otima e √© bastante confortavel, recomendo muito.; Great product. Simple but does the job. Good noise reduction and comfortable to wear.; It is useful as a stop gap on til I can research and afford better quality options"

It offers a good backup battery. It sounds fantastic as well. Adaptable to fit different head sizes. The product is hybrid. Both wired and wireless connections are supported. If your battery runs out, you can use the wire to keep using it.
There is only one issue that I have observed, and that is sweating during the summer.; I have got the black color for me. Battery backup is too good and you can use with aux cable to reserve battery. Sound quality is okay but in higher volume, sound leaks and anyone near you can hear clearly. Noise cancellation is almost none, and call quality is ok(dual pairing is available so if you receive a call on phone and on your pc some video was playing it will get paused automatically , but the problem is call quality gets seriously degraded if you turn on the video - call will get garbled and you wouldn't be able to understand a single word of the person you are talking to. ear sponge quality is ok , you get one on head , and get ready to have sweaty ears in long session. Sponge can be connected again using thin spoon if they get open from the ear cup. Random disconnection is here and there and there is some minor delay - mind it if you are planning to use as gaming headphone , singleplayer is ok but not for multiplayer. biggest drawback is there is no system to fold the earcups. overall good budget headphone.; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition. Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad. It is not good for gaming. For gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.
Thank you for reading just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.; Sound quality and battery is very good.
Price is aslo good, but product is not durable for long time... Maybe product will not work after 12 month.; Sound great,price affordable,mic quality ok hai, connectivity quickly response karta hai, plastick body hai ok hai , comfortable hai per halka sweat aata hai near ear; I bought this product about 2.5 months back, My purpose of buying this headphone is to watch lectures, binge watching of movies I was wondering for budget friendly headphone under rupees 1,000.

So, After using this product for about 2.5 months and still using it. I would like to share the likes and dislikes of this product based on my usage.

Likes :
1) Sound quality is good and crisp great for listening lectures and watching movies and other content.
2) Battery life is also good it gives output of about 15 hours my daily usage is about 4-5 hours.
3) Bluetooth range is quite good for this budget.

Dislikes :
1) It's leather quality is very bad not satisfied with its quality to the leather was ripped out within just 2 months.
2) the plastic quality is not so good you can get scratches on its body easily.
3) it consumes more time to get charge it takes around 3-4 hours for 100% charging.
4) the glue used in this headphones cushion are not applied properly it comes out of the body within 1 month only.
5) the noise cancellation is not good you can easily hear outdoor activities sound Even at full volume.

Based on this budget it's a good product from Indian Brands Zebronics but comes with a lot of comprises.

If you really want quality good headphones atleast go for budget higher than rupees 2,500 or select other brands like sony, boat and other brands.; The quality is good and and sound was low because my right side not working and some small defective but product was good üëç; The product is good but they are faking too much by telling there's ENC and Gaming mode while there's no feature like that, it's just a normal Bluetooth headphone. However portability is good, comfort is good durability i would say cheap it can break easily also aux cable is not durable, sound quality good for this price range."

Not very punchy bass but decent enough. Comes with a stylish look and sony branding. Lasted me an year and still works but the earpads have worn off and couldn't find replacements in the sony centre. Apart from that for a Sony product at the price range is good. Though will suggest going for the 450 model of Sony since that has extra protection at the points where the wire enters the heads.

The cushioning make them comfortable to wear for longer durations, the only caveat is that the faux leather material increases sweating if worn while exercising. That said, this is a long lasting pair of headphones with good sound quality at a reasonable price, overall a great value.; Got this delivered today and these are my first impressions.
Light weight and comfy. Fits snugly over my ears (average size-woman)
The headphones look compact when folded.
Build quality is decent, some items like the buttons could have been given a better finish.
Audio quality is great and the bass is good but some of the highest notes do feel shrill.
The noise isolation is good. No need to keep stuff in the highest volume. Connects well.
The Mike quality is also decent, though the other person said, they heard some mild echos.
The whole thing requires more time to test, but these are my first impressions.
The box had headphones and data cable. There was a small leaflet which did not have any instructions. The leaflet has a small QR code which takes you to their website, which did not have product manuals for this particular product.
Overall am happy for the price I paid.; This product is awesome in this price No one can compete the product quality and sound quality in Very loud clear and bass boom. Nice product manufacturing quality, flexible and light. Over all outstanding performance in this price range; No one need extra bass, whatever the original music has the bass that much only we wanted to hear.
It has a huge extra bass like music in 8D dinchak dinchak, chapri Dj.
Crystal clear no doubt but bassss.!
I have been using realme T100 TWS, in dat bass is very very accurate n hears very gud bass clearer but compared to that it is the worst sound quality.
I used any over/on the ear headphones only for listening MUSIC.
I did OFF all the sound settings in my mobile but still the same.
May be Germans has low bass sounded mobiles over der.

It is like 30/ ticket Theatre sound.; The Blaupunkt BH41 headphones have redefined my audio experience. The 40MM drivers deliver a powerful and immersive sound that brings my favorite music to life. The long playtime ensures that my music journey is uninterrupted, whether during work or leisure. The foldable design, combined with their flexibility and lightweight feel, makes them the perfect on-the-go companion. The built-in mic and TurboVolt fast charging add practicality to their impressive audio capabilities. These headphones are not just about listening; they are a complete package of comfort, style, and cutting-edge technology. A true delight for any audiophile!""; In this price range, this product in my opinion is the best choice. The bass is good, the clarity is good too. Call quality is clear and loud and connectivity is fast.

Just one small drawback is that there's some sound leakage when removed.; My experience with these wireless headphones has been a mixed bag.

On the positive side, they're incredibly lightweight, offer a comfortable fit, and are conveniently foldable for portability.
However, the sound quality is subpar, with muddy and unclear audio that's passable for conference calls but downright terrible for enjoying music or other media. Additionally, the microphone performance is severely lacking, making it difficult for others to hear you clearly during calls.

While they're reasonably priced, the value for money isn't impressive; you get what you pay for. If you prioritize portability and comfort over sound quality and mic performance and primarily need them for quick conference calls, they might suffice. Would suggest shelling out a little more money to get a better set of headphones if you can.; Build quality

Everything is superb ,value for money"

‚Ä¢ sound quality is decent, there is ANC (active noise cancellation) which isn't really good, you will be disappointed if you bought it for noice cancellation, it does supress a little external sound but not even remotely impressive

‚Ä¢ It looks beautiful, mine is black, although it doesn't seem very durable, now i am confident i can take great care of it, but if you aren't careful then it might end up breaking within first few months of purchase.

‚Ä¢ Ambient mode is extremely helpful during functions or any event where you need to be attentive, maybe someone is calling you or something else, so using Ambient mode you can hear external sound more clearly

‚Ä¢ One of the main reason i bought it is because of the battery, and it didn't disappoint, absolute monster when it comes to battery, you can use it for 6 hours continuously and only 10%-5% battery will be consumed.

‚Ä¢ It is also extremely comfortable and covers your ears really well, it's foldable but again handle with care, it doesn't seem very durable, modes such as signature sound makes the listening phenomenal.

‚Ä¢ Gaming - now i didn't expect it to perform this well in terms of gaming but i was surprised, while they didn't mention anything about gaming experience, it did perform very well, games checked - (PUBG, Terraria, COD, Dead Cells, Little Nightmare).; I got these for RS. 1500 and let me tell you that for the price they're amazing.

The sound quality is great due to its 50mm drivers, the bass is very loud and you'll be able to feel that thump of the bass.

The reason I keep telling that they're good FOR THE PRICE is that the build quality is not very good, it's made of plastic which is good enough. The hinges and very low quality. My Left hinge broke after around a one and a half year of use.

But if you look at the prize and the things you get it's worth it. I have other expensive hyper x headphones but the bass that the Rockerz 550 give is better than them

It won't last for long but for its price it's really good, if you take extra good care of it I'm sure it'll have a long life.
The thing is even though the left hinge of my rockers 550 has broken the sound quality is still as good as the day I got them.; The built quality is good . It is comfortably and the noise cancellation is next level as it prevents all the background noise. I tried calling on it and it was pretty decent. The vocals were clear. The bass it good . wont suggests for a bass head . The only disappointment was with to vocals. They are crystal clear and sharp but not soft . Like u can consider it is suitable for hiphop songs but wont be that great for classicals. In general its good but ill suggest if ur planing to buy for vocals clearity plz search for better options. This is my persnal opinion.; I got it for 2600 rs and after one month of usage, here's my review
Pros:
1. decent audio, no complaints there
2. Transparancy mode works well
3. Noice cancelation gets rid of the the general noise, but doesn't work well when someone's talking or around constructions or loud noises. Decent for the price I would say.
4. Battery life is amazing. Better than some high end headphones.
5. It's over ear so it's decently comfortable. Ear cups are pretty soft so you can wear it for a couple of hours at a time. Your ears might get a little hot and sweaty after long usage, but it's definitely anything but uncomfortable.

Cons:
1. Durability is a big issue. For so many features at such small price, i guess they cut costs at durability. If you are a rough handler, I would suggest not to get this. One of the earpiece was roasted 180¬∞ about the joint. I had to carefully move it back into its place. It's now loose, though it is my fault, for not taking care, but for this price, the product shouldn't be this non-durable. I've seen cheaper headphones which are much more durable.

Conclusion: if you can take good care of this headphone, do go for it if it's under 3k.
It is truly value for money below 3k. If it's around 3.5k, I would suggest waiting for a price drop.; This is the only overear headphones under 8k but this has the price of 2k that are far better than tws or onear headphones in terms of ear health just go for it I have using it from 1 year any quality issues with this doesn't happen and the sound quality is also good.overear headphones do some passive noise cancellation to cut the external noise.; This product bass quality is not much batter I personally suggest that don‚Äôt buy this product if you are a bass lover or havey sound and the batter is not bad it was surviv up to 9 to 10 days and comfort is also better but squatting in side tha ear after 20 to 40 min and cussen in very soft and her quality is good not bad build quality was also batter the other headphones and one other bad think is that her charging poat is older not c type if the boat company is plat that charging poart the that was a very good think if you are buying as a use for gaming thin you can buy this this is a good product for gaming very low latency this this headphone"
ZEBRONICS Duke 60hrs Playtime Bluetooth Wireless Over Ear Headphone with Mic (Black),"1,399",https://www.amazon.in/Zebronics-Bluetooth-Headphone-Multifunction-Black/dp/B088FM4QG4/ref=sr_1_35?crid=2XVH1RLCU6S20&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Yb4egBjK562Efi3W07KCs9S8mojaARm9IVE_zIPVWXxwb4LKvtyvYdHUC0OVGr11-xeOtXWJBxtu0LNjA6-7mF3JmPvq5sgUGCvIFJB9HiXRsGktX3o3Iw5CV6N2Uc5pz_4ovB0fpX_KNHiUhzzG2qXn1h7bvGljZxgQGPW22RF3EsEZtFVfeDNzTcTiIaUZrA2Uh_7aDmvkybvUYXSvctzgJwvt4LmUuNIlylgS1Mo.A2irlofkmsvIcjRyQkramN_3YKi9WbBtPByIYlq_xHI&dib_tag=se&keywords=headphones&qid=1719168472&sprefix=headphones%2Caps%2C246&sr=8-35,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CTGoZ5woL._SY355_.jpg,"Zeb-Duke is a wireless headphone with a mic that is an up on style with comfortable ear cushions, adjustable headband, and RGB lights.

With an impressive 60 hours of playback time, they are perfect for users who need reliable headphones for long listening sessions. While they lack active noise cancellation, the overall performance and features make them a solid choice in their price range. The green color adds a unique touch, though it may not be to everyone's taste. Overall, the Duke headphones are a great option for those seeking affordable, high-quality wireless headphones.; The best thing about this headphone is it give over the ear feature in 1299/- and its really confortable and also the bass is unexpectedly GOOD. And for audio volume level, It gives hearable sound in just 18% of computer audio and when i increase audio upto 100 i can hear even the base from 40cm far from the headphones.
As for comfort The cushions are really good, i was able to keep it on ears for 3hrs but not more than that cause it mae my head feel dizzy cause of hearing all my favourate melodies, old school, hip hop, rap and metal songs all at once LOL, But like other headphones i bought this one is stiff and feels like it will break if pressurised to stretch .
As for looks I love the RGB and the grill metal look it gives is DOPE along with plastic matte cover. It is quiet big like having two black and glowing eggs attached to ears but its worth cause the big egg things has lot of BASS inside LOL.
The battery life is incredible, I have been using it since yesterday and it still have 50% battery left.
ONLY PROBLEM is that I found the audio has sharp voice somewhat maximised to keep up with that heavy bass, like when you hear a song you will hear the vocals in sharp voice which is not actually pleasant. I counter this problem by using an equilizer in phone and laptop by decreasing the 14 KHz to some level and increasing 910 Hz to some level. And it only happens in bluetooth mode, The aux is perfect though.
Apart from all this I love my new headphone, Zebronics done a fabulous job by making it and selling it in such an affordable price.; "

The sound quality is still so pure, so is bass, connectivity, battery capacityüëåüèº
So Iam a daily user, I use it all the time, atleast 11-14 hours per day on average...(Iam really into music), you won't have my issues earlier!!!ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The battery life is still holding upüîãüí™üèº, I could use for 2 days with one full charge of 1-1.5 hour.
The cushion pads are also very comfyüò¥
The switches are still good as new...
Connecting two device at the same time was very useful for me.
Even though it has bad noise cancellation features!!ü•≤
Everything checks out,this is worth it......ü§ù
but the physically it might have some issuesüôÇ, the cushion pad skin have started to come off by 5th monthü§ï( which is normal for any headset, and I am a using it all the time),and now, by 7th month iam noticing small cracks over the top, bend plastic part, which iam assuming might break in weeks for good but it was worth it. Although I did hope it would last more than a yearü§ß.....the battery or the sound quality, everything's perfect, physical damage is what limits(which again is normal, considering my heavy usage); Honest review only. Based on sound Quality for the price.
1) Bass/Low frequency- Bass lovers this is for you. Amazing bass, clear and punchy, powerfull. No Forcefully Boomy bass like Boat. Hip hop, Pop music is enjoyable on these.
2) Vocals/ Mid frequency- I'd say that it's Good considering the price but not my the best, You could easily hear some podcast and interviews the vocal are clear but when a song is played and the vocals gets little overshadowed by Bass while playing bass heavy songs.
3) Trebble/ High frequency - I'd say it's Just above average. Here too bcoz of Bass the Trebble gets little only little overshadowed. but with Equilizer this can be balanced and you could hear them easily and is enjoyable.
4) Now comes Sound clarity, instrumental seperation and Sound stage/stereo.- Now even though it's just a 700 I say this works absolutely fine.
The Sound stage is Not very veryWide but just good you can here and feel If any type of sound effect is paning from left to right or vice versa.
The Instrument Seperation is Above average too but needed much More seperation . so does the clarity. No doubt all frequency Low, Mids,High are clear but Trebble needed to be more clear as the Bass is on the Higher side. But it all come down to the price. Yes as I know I am expecting too much for the Price. Bcoz I have heard much better quality sound in other headphones but they cost more than 2K. The Sound quality for the Price is Justified and Very Good.
5th Noise cancellation and Physical Appearance- this is A little bit of Over the earphone type design so my Large Ears gets Fully coverd and so someone with small ears boom this will Fit you well. And noise cancellation there is no Active noise cancellation but the Over the ear Type Makes it Passive voice cancelling Headphone and I have used it in Bus in heavy traffic with Loud Outside noise but then too I was able to here sound from headphone easily at 70% and it blocked outside Traffice horn and vehicle sound. So here it score too.
Blue tooth connectivity and range is is fast and good, button are tactile and good.
6th Gaming- Gaming you will get some latency but is playable for BGMi But the judging the enemy Foot steps is bit of task due to the Average Sound stage and instrumental seperation as well as Average Trebble.
Rest all is good and is A very Good Headphone.; Writing this review (cons.)after using for 15 days.
1. Sound on v. Call is very poor sometimes sound buffers, also sound gets cut frequently from the other side on call.
2. Not so comfortable for long hours.
3. Not for those who dive into music for hours.
4. I would like to give it a bare 1 star ‚≠ê for overall experience.
5. Just invest some extra into other headphones, not to regret later like I am.üòêüôÅ; Sound was good, product is nice, Quality is better then boat company; The plastic body cracked at the point the pivot joins the head cushion , it's not just me , but me 2 other friends have the same problem because we bought it together , all same , and there's a crack within 4 months , and ear cushion plastic is coming out , ofcourse the sound quality is really good , and very very very loud at its full volume , just hand it in your neck , and raise the volume , deafing sound; Headphone is good audio quality is good but quality of cusion in below average; Good Quality built & sound.; While the sound and battery performance is decent, the ear cushions are very flimsy and tears off in less then a month of average use.

Liked the place where buttons configured on the left cup and looks premium. Grey and golden makes it classy. Audio jack included and connects well. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.
Thank you very much,

The USB cable is of normal length. One of the Cable was li'l bit tight to be used with my phone. The cables seem to be tough and hard. Overall the product is ok. Since I was looking for a pack of 2 at this price I am fine with this.; The moment i inserted it in my iphone it started to connect to my bluetooth which shoul not happen and shows thats its a cheap third party dongle which does not work and also report this brand and bring it down for such scamms; I want a type-c cable for my one plus mobile as my cable is not working,the cost of original one plus dash cable is high so i decided to buy case plus dash cable and i found out really impressive it look same as one plus dash cable, it charge as fast as original cable so if you are planning to buy cable you can go for it without thinking.; This cable seems to be custom made for OnePlus devices. So, think twice before ordering for others.
Did not fit my Samsung A50 and I had to return it. No issues with the return process.
Also for the warranty, you need to send a screenshot of your review on Amazon. Although they haven't explicitly asked for 5 stars, this activity seems a little shady and might explain the high rating for this product.
The cable looks to be of good quality though, so have rated 3 stars.; Very Good cable at a reasonable cost. No wonders it charge my mobile quickly it takes less then half an hour to reach 60% charge from 2%. Quality of the cable is great and seems to be safe. It can be use also for data transfer and the transfering speed is also good. Over all a good product and must buy.; are both the cables working ? the first time I brought these cable one wasn't working, so I returned and ordered it again. and again one of the cable is not working! very disappointed in such poor service and customer satisfaction.; You simply cant get a better duplicate cable at this price. It works well with my OP6 and the charging time is similar to the original OP dash cable and the overall quality and finish is equally appreciable. I am using these two additional cables in my car and travel bag and so i can leave my original cable at home."

Very good in-hand feel. Good and sturdy build. Feels like a long lasting one for sure. A good fit for ears. Feels lightweight and can be plugged in for longer durations.
Sound:
If you're a Bass lover, you'll get addicted soon. The detailed clarity of notes is breathtaking. Not of the high end quality but atleast safe to say it exceeded expectations at this price range.
On flipside, tha bass overpowers the vocal strength, so keep an eye on it.
On the app, I would recommend to turn the ""Oneplus 3d Audio"" mode on at all times. Will be a wonderful experience for audiophiles.
ANC:
Powerful noise-cancelling even with heavy outdoor noises. 3 modes of ANC plus transparency mode as well. You'll feel the deafening silence while indoors if tuned to Max.
App Support:
Hey Melody app is a gamechanger. Allows you to have numerous customisations. It's quick and accurate. Always check on the firmware updates for better listening.
Portability:
Safe to carry around. Pocket friendly as well as grippy at most times. The matte finish allows grippy handling. I would have loved the same for the earbuds as well. But overall ain't complaining.
It got a slider for volume control which is a welcoming upgrade.
Battery life:
Excellent battery life even with ANC on. Can go without charge even for a week with moderate usage. Fast charging support as well.

Flops:
1) The earbuds got a glossy finish. So a fingerprint magnet for sure.
2) It supports LHDC but not LDAC. So phones other than Oneplus/Oppo/Realme and some Xiaomi phones don't support LHDC. A bit disappointing though.
3) Not enough ingress protection (IP) for the case alone. IPX4 is not a welcoming move.

Verdict:
An all-rounder TWS with a premium look and features at a budget price. With the Oneplus 3d Audio you'll feel being in a private concert tuned exclusively for your ear's needs. LDAC would have made it a must buy. Rest assured, this is a blockbuster!
A Highly recommended product.; I recently got my the OnePlus Buds 3 In Ear TWS Bluetooth Earbuds, and I'm very much impressed by the quality and performance. The built quality is exceptional, exuding a premium feel that's evident the moment you hold them.

The materials used are top-notch, ensuring durability and longevity. The size of the earbuds is just right, providing a comfortable fit that stays in place securely, even during extended use.

One of the best features for me is the noise cancellation capability, which works like a pro, immersing me completely in my audio experience without any external distractions. Additionally, the charging speed is impressive, ensuring minimal downtime between uses.

Compact and easy to carry around, these earbuds are perfect for on-the-go use, whether I'm commuting, working out, or simply relaxing at home. In my opinion, they truly are best in class and I would highly recommend them to anyone in search of premium quality earbuds with exceptional performance.

Was actually planned for Apple one but buying this i am really happy and satisfied.
Recommending to other too; You basically only have two other alternatives at this price: the Oppo enco air 3 pro and Realme air 5 pro. They have their own flaws. Realme's doesn't have IP for dust (IPx5) which is a big no-no.

This is a bit pricier than the other two
The sound quality and multiple-endpoint connection are great

But the cons:
ANC is average imo. But still good for the price.
Buds don't securely fit in my ear. The app's test says perfect fit, which is wrong.
As a result, using the volume up/down slider is a bit difficult as the buds sometimes fall out.
If the fit is even a bit off the bass loses power so I'm having to adjust every now and then
LHDC codec. It's only supported by Redmi, OnePlus and Oppo (I think?) phones. The LDAC codec present in Realme & oppo earbuds are rather ubiquitous.

P.S. This is my first earbuds, so your mileage regarding security of fit might vary.; This the by far one of the best earbuds we can have within 5000, it's design, noise cancellation, mike, connectivity all sre good. It's looking durable, easy to connect. I have not tried it for gaming but i think it won't disappoint there also; Great sound quality with well built buds and matte finish case, stylish and case durability is good. Fast Google pair connection and great battery life with ANC on.; I am using this with oneplus 12R, it works very well. Even connects very nicely to my oneplus pad. So its a good choice if you're in oneplus eco system. However, the sound out of box was too muffled and bass rich for my taste. We can adjust EQ in the settings and after few modifications I'm very happy with this headphones, it sounds good now with enough treble and vocals are better after changing it to new EQ setting. ANC and Mic works well too. Overall, it's definitely a good product for the price they are asking considering you change the EQ settings as it is too much focused on bass by default. Hope it helps :); The sound quality is immersive experience, it has lots of controls and features in their own application. The connection speed is ultrafast with Google fast pair. The quality of the product is awesome, valuable for money and it is easily fits in all type of face structures.; Quite coold design that looks very unique, however, the noise cancellation is not that great and doesn't match the level how its being promoted.

In traffic you have to speak very loudly and in places of less noise too you have to speak at a higher level than normal.

To me, the price should've been between 3-4k at max.; I was looking to replace my Sony wf-1000xm3 earbuds because they really do suck for phone calls. The mic is garbage and picks up a lot of background noise. After watching numerous reviews, I landed on these not for the price but because they offered close to best-in-class performance on comfort, control, quality, and price.

These are by far the best earbuds for the price and I'll buy them again.; Lleg√≥ antes de tiempo, son peque√±os (tama√±o justo), ergon√≥micos y tienen una cancelaci√≥n de ruido excepcional, simples y elegantes. Super recomendado; Over the years I‚Äôve owned mid-priced earbuds from Sennheiser, Sony, Samsung, AKG, Soundpeats, and Avantree. [I‚Äôm a longtime Android phone user, so Apple isn‚Äôt really an option for me.] Some of the earbuds had great sound. Some have great battery life. Some are incredibly comfortable when wearing for long periods of time. Some are really good for phone calls. Some have really good noise reduction (whether because of ANC or simply blocking noise by tightly fitting into your ear canal). Some are really easy to place on or in your ears.

What I learned is that what‚Äôs most important to me is really good sound for listening to music, really good clarity and background noise reduction when making phone calls, easy to place on or in your ears, and really comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The other attributes don‚Äôt need to be top-notch for my needs. Additionally, I‚Äôve never been one to spend $$$$ to get any brand‚Äôs flagship earbuds.

None of the earbuds I owned fit the bill for what was most important to me. So I went searching for a new pair that did. My online research led me to the OnePlus Buds 3 and I couldn‚Äôt be happier! ‚Ä¶except that I paid $99.99 for mine and as I‚Äôm writing this review they‚Äôre currently on sale for $79.99 üòä

The OnePlus Buds 3 have really good sound, really good call quality, are really easy to place in your ears, and really comfortable to wear for hours at a time.; ÿ≥ŸÖÿßÿπÿßÿ™ ÿ®ÿßŸäÿ∏ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÖÿßÿπŸá ÿßŸÑÿ¥ŸÖÿßŸÑ ÿ®ÿßŸäÿ∏ÿ© ÿ®ÿ™ÿ®ŸÇŸä Ÿ¢Ÿ†% ŸàÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸäŸÜ Ÿ°Ÿ†Ÿ†% ŸàÿßŸÑÿπŸÑÿ®Ÿá Ÿ°Ÿ†Ÿ†% Ÿäÿßÿ±Ÿäÿ™ ŸÖÿ≠ÿØÿ¥ Ÿäÿ¥ÿ™ÿ±Ÿä ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿßÿ¶ÿπ ÿØŸá; Works as intended and Im super happy with the quality, way better sound than the Liberty 4NC that I've had before.
Was sent to me by 3C-HK through Amazon and it took about 14 days from China to Sweden. The only thing I can complain about is that the manual and box was in chinese and there is no manual in english on Oneplus support page, also not sure about updates, if theres chinese/EU differnece. Not a big deal, but its still something you should know if you are ordering them from EU.
Thanks!"

Quality Ear Cushions - It has been ergonomically designed and structured as an over-ear headphone to provide the best user experience with its good quality ear cushions","The casing for the headset looked like buying a brand not a loose plastic case but a box and moulded casing, Sound quality with deep bass thump, Soft on ears, the buds are softer than others. Liked the place where buttons configured on the left cup and looks premium. Grey and golden makes it classy. Audio jack included and connects well. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.
Thank you very much,
Your customer Armaan."

The sound quality is still so pure, so is bass, connectivity, battery capacityüëåüèº
So Iam a daily user, I use it all the time, atleast 11-14 hours per day on average...(Iam really into music), you won't have my issues earlier!!!ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The battery life is still holding upüîãüí™üèº, I could use for 2 days with one full charge of 1-1.5 hour.
The cushion pads are also very comfyüò¥
The switches are still good as new...
Connecting two device at the same time was very useful for me.
Even though it has bad noise cancellation features!!ü•≤
Everything checks out,this is worth it......ü§ù
but the physically it might have some issuesüôÇ, the cushion pad skin have started to come off by 5th monthü§ï( which is normal for any headset, and I am a using it all the time),and now, by 7th month iam noticing small cracks over the top, bend plastic part, which iam assuming might break in weeks for good but it was worth it. Although I did hope it would last more than a yearü§ß.....the battery or the sound quality, everything's perfect, physical damage is what limits(which again is normal, considering my heavy usage); Honest review only. Based on sound Quality for the price.
1) Bass/Low frequency- Bass lovers this is for you. Amazing bass, clear and punchy, powerfull. No Forcefully Boomy bass like Boat. Hip hop, Pop music is enjoyable on these.
2) Vocals/ Mid frequency- I'd say that it's Good considering the price but not my the best, You could easily hear some podcast and interviews the vocal are clear but when a song is played and the vocals gets little overshadowed by Bass while playing bass heavy songs.
3) Trebble/ High frequency - I'd say it's Just above average. Here too bcoz of Bass the Trebble gets little only little overshadowed. but with Equilizer this can be balanced and you could hear them easily and is enjoyable.
4) Now comes Sound clarity, instrumental seperation and Sound stage/stereo.- Now even though it's just a 700 I say this works absolutely fine.
The Sound stage is Not very veryWide but just good you can here and feel If any type of sound effect is paning from left to right or vice versa.
The Instrument Seperation is Above average too but needed much More seperation . so does the clarity. No doubt all frequency Low, Mids,High are clear but Trebble needed to be more clear as the Bass is on the Higher side. But it all come down to the price. Yes as I know I am expecting too much for the Price. Bcoz I have heard much better quality sound in other headphones but they cost more than 2K. The Sound quality for the Price is Justified and Very Good.
5th Noise cancellation and Physical Appearance- this is A little bit of Over the earphone type design so my Large Ears gets Fully coverd and so someone with small ears boom this will Fit you well. And noise cancellation there is no Active noise cancellation but the Over the ear Type Makes it Passive voice cancelling Headphone and I have used it in Bus in heavy traffic with Loud Outside noise but then too I was able to here sound from headphone easily at 70% and it blocked outside Traffice horn and vehicle sound. So here it score too.
Blue tooth connectivity and range is is fast and good, button are tactile and good.
6th Gaming- Gaming you will get some latency but is playable for BGMi But the judging the enemy Foot steps is bit of task due to the Average Sound stage and instrumental seperation as well as Average Trebble.
Rest all is good and is A very Good Headphone.; Writing this review (cons.)after using for 15 days.
1. Sound on v. Call is very poor sometimes sound buffers, also sound gets cut frequently from the other side on call.
2. Not so comfortable for long hours.
3. Not for those who dive into music for hours.
4. I would like to give it a bare 1 star ‚≠ê for overall experience.
5. Just invest some extra into other headphones, not to regret later like I am.üòêüôÅ; Sound was good, product is nice, Quality is better then boat company; The plastic body cracked at the point the pivot joins the head cushion , it's not just me , but me 2 other friends have the same problem because we bought it together , all same , and there's a crack within 4 months , and ear cushion plastic is coming out , ofcourse the sound quality is really good , and very very very loud at its full volume , just hand it in your neck , and raise the volume , deafing sound; Headphone is good audio quality is good but quality of cusion in below average; Good Quality built & sound.; While the sound and battery performance is decent, the ear cushions are very flimsy and tears off in less then a month of average use.

Here's a detailed review of this wireless earbud offering:

**Design and Comfort:**
The Zeb Bang Pro comes in an ergonomic and sleek design that fits comfortably in my ears. They are lightweight and stay securely in place even during workouts. The earbuds also have touch-sensitive controls for play/pause, skip tracks, and volume adjustment, which are quite responsive.

**Sound Quality:**
In terms of sound quality, these earbuds deliver crisp and clear audio. The bass is punchy, the mids are well-balanced, and the highs are sharp. Whether I'm listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls, the audio quality has been consistently impressive.

**Connectivity:**
Pairing the Zeb Bang Pro with my devices was a breeze. The Bluetooth connection has been stable, and I haven't experienced any dropouts during usage. These earbuds also support mono mode, allowing me to use either earbud individually if needed.

**Battery Life:**
One of the standout features of the Zeb Bang Pro is its exceptional battery life. With around 7-8 hours of playback time on a single charge, I rarely find myself needing to recharge them. The charging case provides additional backup, extending the total usage time to a substantial length.

**Call Quality:**
Call quality is another area where these earbuds shine. The built-in microphone captures clear audio, and I've had no issues with call clarity, whether indoors or in noisy environments.

**IPX4 Rating:**
The IPX4 rating makes the Zeb Bang Pro sweat and splash-resistant, making them suitable for workouts and outdoor activities. However, they may not be suitable for submersion in water.

**Value for Money:**
Considering the features and performance, the Zeb Bang Pro offers great value for its price point. It competes well with more expensive earbuds in terms of sound quality and battery life.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the Zebronics Zeb Bang Pro wireless earbuds are a solid choice for those seeking a budget-friendly yet high-quality audio experience. Their comfortable design, impressive sound quality, long battery life, and ease of use make them a commendable option in the wireless earbud market. Whether you're a music enthusiast or just need reliable earbuds for everyday use, the Zeb Bang Pro won't disappoint.; Sound quality is good, product is overall good but there is some lacks like voice calling issues sometimes and this is not very comfortable to wear it for a long time.

I decided to switch to these headphones since earbuds just don't fit properly in my ears and feel like they'll fall off any second. I've been using these non-stop for the past 2 months now and they're still working as new. I'm a very reckless user so the fact that there's not even a single scratch on them is amazing. The sound quality is great compared to the shitty stuff I've been using before.

One drawback is that it gets loose very fast. It does get a bit annoying since I always keep my hair open and it sometimes slides here and there, almost slipping off my head if I look down for too long. A quick fix is to tie a rubber band around it overnight so it fits nice and snug in the morning. I also wish there was more emphasis on the bass but you can just tweak the equaliser on the app and it's all good.

One more thing is that I wish these were noise cancelling. I use public transport, so I have to use a volume booster because of how loud the background noise gets.

Lookswise, It looks very sleek and modern which goes with all outfits.

If you're on a budget and you want a good quality pair of headphones that look good as well, these are the best ones!!

Update: Its currently June 2024, so over a year of owning these headphones and there's quite a bit of wear and tear. The top layer of the cushions is peeling off quite a bit, and I've noticed that the Bluetooth connectivity isn't quite as strong as before? If that's possible? Still really great in terms of audio quality and battery life. I think I just need to buy replacements for the ear cushions but I'm not sure what to do about the cushion that's on the top of the head.

I wish they had included a AUX port in case the battery runs out. That's my only complaint with these headphones.; The headphone is mediocre for daily use. It is decently comfortable but can't passively isolate much background noise due to lack of active noise cancellation (ANC). After long use it hurts my ears a little bit but not so much to complain about. The sound quality is good but not excellent. The bass is not upto the expectation. The long battery life is good and for me it lasts for more than 2 weeks with 2-3 hours of use every day. The app is good and lets me adjust the sound profile.; The sound quality is great, dual connectivity makes switching the device a piece of cake compared to single connecting devices. Build quality is good for the price but is not great, I feel like I have to be careful when putting in my bag. Fit is also comfortable but long outs with the over ear design is definitely not comfortable; All features and feels are awesome. Sturdy built and audio quality is good.Charging speed is also fast. Good quality of audio call due to good mic placement. Weight is good and manageable, earpads are also confortable enough. Look & feel justifies the price.; Build quality is awesome, very lightweight, ok ok noise cancellation bit bass is really good. I am using these from a year now, battery backup is next level. Very easy to use.; Love the headphones. Amazing sound quality and soft ear pads helps in long term usage. I have been using since a month and have no issues. I have used boat before and I have faced issues in connecting bluetooth but this is very quick. Also the battery life is 100/10. Overall amazing product

Negatives:
When I use fan on full speed, my voice is not clear. So not so much on the noise cancellation they claim; I‚Äôve lately been having problem while hearing the sound of audio as the headphone‚Äôs making buzz sounds and multi point connections is also not working (within a month).; Headphones give immersive natural sound.

Build quality is just ok. Does not feel very sturdy. The cloth they have used to cover the speakers sometimes sheds strings.

Pretty comfortable to use due to light weight and very soft and big cushioning. Although heat builds up if used continuously.

The headphones could have been more compact. They appear bigger after wearing.; √ìtimo produto, som de √≥tima qualidade e bateria excelente; O som muito bom, e grava√ß√µes de √°udio no Whatsapp saem com boa qualidade. √â reconhecido r√°pido no Bluetooth do smartphone.

Um custo/benef√≠cio bom.; Very good sound and product is very light, price was the best not to expensive and good quality.; I've had thse headphones, for two months now, for the gym and I still have not charged them since the day I got them. I cannot say enough.; These are great headphones for this price, and they can often be found at a discount. I've used them extensively for the past few months and they have gotten better over time.

COMFORT:
Initially, they were a bit stiff and uncomfortable, especially the ear pads. They would make my ears a bit sore after an hour or two of use. After a few months, the ear pads and headband have softened up and they feel much more comfortable. I can wear them all day and not feel a thing. They somehow feel more comfortable than my Sony WH1000XM4's which are $300 premium noise cancelling headphones. The XM4s make my ears very hot and the top headband hurts the top of my head after a while. These WH-CH520s keep my ears cooler by virtue of them being on-ear rather than over-ear, as well as staying comfortable on my head all day due to their light weight.

SOUND QUALITY:
The sound quality on these is great for the price and size of the drivers. Out of the box with no EQ I'd describe the overall sound as being slightly warm but very accurate. They have a slight V-shape Harmann Curve sound profile, with very clear and present mids. The bass is clear and pretty clean without being too thumpy; not the quickest bass response I've heard though. The trebles are a bit recessed but pleasant on the ear. However, you can boost the treble up with EQ in the Sony Headphones app at 6.3K Hz by a few dB to get more detail. These are definitely geared towards general consumer use with a very slightly sound profile perfect for pop, rap, rock, edm, indie, podcasts, etc. However, I was surprised to find that the bass is very tame and accurate, and the mids are crystal clear and sit perfectly in the mix. At this price-point and target consumer I was expecting these to be very boomy and washed out sounding, but they are actually very balanced and accurate. They really shine in vocals, voices always sound very forward and detailed. In terms of sound stage, they're a clear step above any in-ear headphones, but they aren't as wide as a typical over-ear headphones, which is to be expected. Imaging is great and accurate, they do a great job accurately placing all of the instruments in a stereo mix. Overall the sound on these pleasantly surprised me and definitely punch way above their weight class for the price. They sound as detailed and accurate as $100 headphones. If you're looking for something very ""neutral,"" these are your headphones. But with the EQ provided in Sony's Headphone app, you can theoretically have these sound almost exactly how you want.

BATTERY LIFE:
Battery life on these is amazing. They can last me around 4-5 days with around 7-8 hours of use each day. I use them nearly all day during work. They charge really quickly too, which is great.

FUNCTIONS:
They have a standard pause/play/skip/answer/hang-up middle button, as well as volume up and down buttons. You can skip and rewind by holding the volume buttons.

They can also be paired with Sony's headphone app which allows you to change the EQ settings for these and have them sound how you want. There aren't a ton of sliders for the EQ, but enough for most people to customize their sound to their liking. There's also a fun custom EQ feature in the app that asks you to pick your favorite sound profile from various examples and builds you a custom EQ profile based on your taste.

The microphone on these are pretty good for headphones. They sound better than average in terms of headphone mics, but they don't sound nearly as good as the iPhone 15's built-in microphone. But if you need these for a quick phone call or video call, they work great. They can't fold up in any way but the ear cups can swivel up. So if you take them off your head and swivel them to hang around your neck, the ear pads will face up; which isn't good nor bad, just something to keep in mind.

EXERCISE:
If you're the type to use headphones rather than earphones when exercising, these would probably suffice. They are breathable and lightweight, while also having a decent clamping force to stay on your head. If i shake my head vigorously though, they inevitably fall off. The earpads are a faux-leather so they're very easy to wipe off and clean. Although, I'm typically the type of person to use earphones while exercising. The most extensive exercise I've done with these headphones is skateboard with them, but as soon as I start jumping around to do any tricks, they start to slide off my head. They should do fine with typical gym exercises movements though, they won't slide off if you're looking down.

NOISE CANCELLATION:
In terms of noise cancellation, they are decent. They obviously don't have any active noise cancelling features, but passively, they block a bit of noise, maybe 10-12 dB or so. They aren't going to blow your mind though in terms of noise cancellation. However, if you have music playing at around 40-50% volume, they block out a considerable amount of outside noise like most headphones do. I can walk through busy downtown streets with these and not hear much at all if I have music going. They'll definitely block out a considerable amount of noise in an office, cafe, train ride, etc. so long as you're actually listening to something.

BUILD QUALITY:
These headphones are built surprisingly well. The materials are obviously cheap, but they don't feel like it. The plastic is lightweight, but solid at the same time. The earpads and headband padding are both the same faux-leather, which is a bit stiff at first but softens up over time. The padding feels like it will last a long time simply because of its synthetic nature.

DESIGN:
Taste in the way these are designed is obviously subjective, but I think these look great. They have a modern, but more timeless design. They don't look super retro, but they don't look super modern either. They just look like clean, standard headphones that will look great for years. I love how the Sony logo is faintly placed on one side of the headband. It's there, but not obnoxious."

Overall good.
In bluetooth field... Sony is doing decent job.
Owned sennheiser hd599 &beyerdynamic 770 so no comparisons
But first time using wireless +ANC headphones and happy to say sony has done a fantastic job.
Providing good++ value for good enough price.; I recently purchased this headphone and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is truly remarkable, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience that brings my music and podcasts to life. Whether I'm jamming to my favorite tunes or engrossed in a podcast, the clarity and depth of the sound are truly impressive.

One of the standout features for me is the microphone's noise cancellation capabilities. While it may not completely eliminate all background noise, it does a commendable job of reducing ambient sounds during calls. The result is clear and crisp communication without the distractions of external noise. It's perfect for virtual meetings and online gaming sessions where effective communication is key.

The design of the headphone is sleek and comfortable, making it suitable for extended wear. The over-ear cups provide a snug fit without causing discomfort, and the adjustable headband ensures a customized and secure fit. The build quality also feels robust, indicating durability for everyday use.

I appreciate the user-friendly controls that allow me to adjust volume, skip tracks, and manage calls effortlessly. The Bluetooth connectivity is reliable, providing a stable connection with my devices without any noticeable lag.

Overall, this headphone is a solid choice for anyone seeking a combination of excellent sound quality and decent noise cancellation. It strikes a great balance between performance and affordability, making it a valuable addition to my audio gear. Highly recommended!; Bought for like 6.8K during the Republic Day sale. Worth every penny you pay for. Used these for a week and here's the experience:

Pros:
1) Beautiful quality bass despite the price point.

2) Sony is just Sony, sound quality is 100% even at the highest of volumes.

3) Insane battery life, even with the ANC on.

4) Super light-weight (approx 190g) and extremely comfy foam pads. Easily can listen for hours together.

5) Figuring it out how to connect took me a few minutes, but after that no issues at all. Just instant Bluetooth connection with any device.

The only con:
1) ANC is kinda poor, and it's understandable cause they have to differentiate the XB910N from the CH720N. So it doesn't really affect my rating.

Bottom-line, if you're looking a pair of excellent headphones below 10K just go for these. You can't wrong with a pair of Sony headphones.; Title: Exceptional Performance, but No Carry Case Included

‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Having recently acquired the Sony WH-CH720N headphones, I've been thoroughly impressed with their overall performance. The noise-canceling feature is effective in creating a peaceful listening experience, whether I'm on the go or immersed in a noisy environment.

The sound quality is top-notch, offering a well-balanced and rich audio profile. The bass is impactful without overshadowing the mids and highs, ensuring an immersive and enjoyable listening experience. The wireless connectivity is convenient, and the battery life easily meets the demands of long flights and extended usage.

Comfort is a priority for me, and the WH-CH720N excels in this aspect. The plush ear cushions and adjustable headband make these headphones comfortable for prolonged use. I've worn them for hours without any discomfort, making them ideal for extended work or entertainment sessions.

The touch controls on the ear cups are intuitive and responsive, allowing for seamless navigation through tracks and volume adjustment. The built-in microphone delivers clear voice quality during calls, adding to the overall versatility of these headphones.

One notable downside, however, is the absence of a carry case in the package. While the headphones themselves are durable, a dedicated case would have been appreciated for added protection during travel and storage.

In summary, the Sony WH-CH720N headphones offer an exceptional blend of performance, comfort, and convenience. Despite the lack of a carry case, they remain a solid choice for those seeking reliable wireless headphones with effective noise cancelation.; Bom cancelamento de ru√≠do e fone leve para usar por bastante horas; I recently invested in the Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations on multiple fronts. As an avid music lover and someone who appreciates a good pair of headphones, these have quickly become my go-to choice for a premium audio experience.

1. Comfortable Ear Coverage:

One of the standout features of these headphones is the generous size of the ear cups. They provide excellent coverage, enveloping my entire ears in a cocoon of sound. The over-ear design not only enhances comfort during long listening sessions but also effectively isolates ambient noise, allowing me to immerse myself completely in the music.

2. Superior Noise Cancelling:

The noise-cancelling technology on the WH-CH720N is simply outstanding. Whether I'm on a noisy commute or working in a bustling cafe, the headphones create a tranquil listening environment by effectively blocking out external disturbances. The adaptive nature of the noise cancellation ensures a seamless transition between different environments, providing a truly immersive experience.

3. Impressive Battery Life:

Battery life is a crucial factor for any wireless headphone user, and Sony has delivered in this department. The WH-CH720N boasts an impressive battery life, providing hours of uninterrupted music playback on a single charge. This is perfect for long flights, road trips, or simply when you don't want to worry about constantly recharging your headphones.

4. Seamless Wireless Connectivity:

Setting up the wireless connection was a breeze, thanks to the seamless Bluetooth pairing. The headphones quickly connect to my two devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance. The freedom of movement that wireless functionality offers adds to the overall convenience of these headphones.

5. Crisp Sound Quality:

Of course, none of these features would matter if the sound quality wasn't top-notch. Fortunately, the WH-CH720N delivers crisp and clear audio across various genres. The bass is punchy without being overwhelming, and the mids and highs are well-balanced, providing a rich and detailed listening experience.

6. Enhanced Experience with the Headphones App:

What sets the WH-CH720N apart is the fantastic user experience provided by the Headphones app. The app allows for easy customization of sound settings, enabling me to tailor the audio profile to my liking. Additionally, firmware updates and additional features are seamlessly delivered through the app, ensuring that my headphones stay current and optimized for the best performance.

In conclusion, the Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones have proven to be an excellent investment. The combination of comfort, noise cancellation, battery life, connectivity, and sound quality makes them a standout choice in the crowded market of wireless headphones. If you're in the market for a reliable and immersive audio experience, these headphones are definitely worth considering.; I have spent years fighting to find a decent pair of bluetooth headphones since no phone manufacturer wants to make a decent phone with a jack anymore (which is endlessly stupid, but I digress). I have tried everything form fancy expensive Galaxy Buds to a myriad of budget options, and all have the same problems. Flawed connectivity, noticeably glitchy, slightly reduced sound quality.

These finally fix it. The inclusion of an option to use a headphone jack on devices that let you is a great feature. Along with multipoint connect. They fit perfectly around my skinny neck (your mileage may very on that), so travel with them is a breeze. And for the sound quality, these are absolutely the best headphones for your money.

I was loathe to go to overears full time because I like being able to take one out to hear my surroundings, and every noise passthrough I used before was sucky. (usually the outside noise obnoxiously trebley). Not with these. I actually go to concerts to listen with my headphones on because it actually makes the concerts sound better than with no headphones. Extremely convincing, near perfect noise passthrough.

The app is easy to use and has a great selection of features: from custom EQs, to adjusting the noise pass through, to other various quality of life settings. The 3D adaptive sound feature is great, though a little tricky to set up at first, and noise cancellation is very good, though not the best in the world. The battery life is also almost unbelievable. I use these headphones a lot--sometimes all day--and I still only have to charge them once or twice a week. Multipoint connection is also a very nice plus if, say, I am working at my computer and still want to be able to answer phone calls hands-free.

There are some minor flaws with them, though. First sometimes very low bassey notes from the outside world can trigger the speakers in them and give you very loud, deep popping noises. (E.g., this occasionally happens when I am riding in the car and hitting bumps in the road). Occasional outside sounds in passthrough through will sound muddled. Also the noise cancellation--while quite good--isn't perfect for every situation. Specifically, it has more trouble than, say, Bose headphones with loud, sudden sounds like fireworks. But for the money, it is still the best noise cancellation and passthrough system you can buy.

Another (minor) complaint, though, is that the adaptive settings aren't always very great. It often thinks I am sitting and automatically turns on noise cancellation when I am very much driving or walking around town or once even ice skating--all situations where passthrough is crucial. And even if I am sitting, sometimes I really want passthrough on (like if I'm in a cafe), but it automatically tries to turn noise cancelling on annoyingly. Thankfully, it can be easily overridden in the app. These days, I usually just keep the adaptive sound setting off and adjust the settings to fit the situation but sometimes it will randomly go back to automatic/adaptive mode.

My final and complaint is with the microphone for phone calls. Sometimes it works perfectly and the other line can hear my fine, sometimes all they can hear is background noise, sometimes they really can't hear me at all. I am not sure if it is some sort of firmware issue or if the microphone placement is just too far from my mouth, but for phone calls it can be a tad unreliable. When it works, which is around 75% of the time, it's perfectly good even though I have to talk a little louder than I normally would sometimes.

But all those flaws aside, these are probably the best all-around headphones I have owned and for the $120 I paid for them it's a steal. They may be more expensive as I got them on sale, but I have used headphones multiple times the price that are poorer quality and less functional than these. I'd have paid upwards of twice the price for what I got.; Couldn‚Äôt get the price here for them. They‚Äôre awesome for commuting and keeping the rest of the room quiet; There's alot to appreciate with this one. Priced well, the audio adaptability is great and comfortable to my ears!"

It offers a good backup battery. It sounds fantastic as well. Adaptable to fit different head sizes. The product is hybrid. Both wired and wireless connections are supported. If your battery runs out, you can use the wire to keep using it.
There is only one issue that I have observed, and that is sweating during the summer.; I have got the black color for me. Battery backup is too good and you can use with aux cable to reserve battery. Sound quality is okay but in higher volume, sound leaks and anyone near you can hear clearly. Noise cancellation is almost none, and call quality is ok(dual pairing is available so if you receive a call on phone and on your pc some video was playing it will get paused automatically , but the problem is call quality gets seriously degraded if you turn on the video - call will get garbled and you wouldn't be able to understand a single word of the person you are talking to. ear sponge quality is ok , you get one on head , and get ready to have sweaty ears in long session. Sponge can be connected again using thin spoon if they get open from the ear cup. Random disconnection is here and there and there is some minor delay - mind it if you are planning to use as gaming headphone , singleplayer is ok but not for multiplayer. biggest drawback is there is no system to fold the earcups. overall good budget headphone.; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition. Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad. It is not good for gaming. For gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.
Thank you for reading just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.; Sound quality and battery is very good.
Price is aslo good, but product is not durable for long time... Maybe product will not work after 12 month.; Sound great,price affordable,mic quality ok hai, connectivity quickly response karta hai, plastick body hai ok hai , comfortable hai per halka sweat aata hai near ear; I bought this product about 2.5 months back, My purpose of buying this headphone is to watch lectures, binge watching of movies I was wondering for budget friendly headphone under rupees 1,000.

So, After using this product for about 2.5 months and still using it. I would like to share the likes and dislikes of this product based on my usage.

Likes :
1) Sound quality is good and crisp great for listening lectures and watching movies and other content.
2) Battery life is also good it gives output of about 15 hours my daily usage is about 4-5 hours.
3) Bluetooth range is quite good for this budget.

Dislikes :
1) It's leather quality is very bad not satisfied with its quality to the leather was ripped out within just 2 months.
2) the plastic quality is not so good you can get scratches on its body easily.
3) it consumes more time to get charge it takes around 3-4 hours for 100% charging.
4) the glue used in this headphones cushion are not applied properly it comes out of the body within 1 month only.
5) the noise cancellation is not good you can easily hear outdoor activities sound Even at full volume.

Based on this budget it's a good product from Indian Brands Zebronics but comes with a lot of comprises.

If you really want quality good headphones atleast go for budget higher than rupees 2,500 or select other brands like sony, boat and other brands.; The quality is good and and sound was low because my right side not working and some small defective but product was good üëç; The product is good but they are faking too much by telling there's ENC and Gaming mode while there's no feature like that, it's just a normal Bluetooth headphone. However portability is good, comfort is good durability i would say cheap it can break easily also aux cable is not durable, sound quality good for this price range."

(5 stars for sound / 4 stars for build quality)

AKG is an Austrian company, now owned by Harman International of the famous harman/kardon brand of hi-fi equipment and JBL.

If you're looking for a good pair of budget headphones for an Immersive listening experience, the K92 is perfect. They may not be the best looking ones, but the metal frame makes them quite sturdy, while most expensive brands are made completely of plastic.

I bought these headphones purely for listening to music via my computer. The ear cups of my previous (decent) AKG K52s had become scruffy so I wanted to change and after scouting several hi-fi audio websites, decided to upgrade to the K92 which had good recommendations as opposed to the K72.

The headphones deliver crisp, clear sound with no or minimal distortion (depending on your audio source or file). They have have a good audio frequency bandwidth (16 - 22000 Hz) which provides a wide dynamic range which means you get bold bass and clear treble. The low impedence of 32 ohms means that the headphones can be driven easily at low volume by a computer sound card without the need for an additional amplifier. A 40 mm driver delivers good bass which is not too punchy, but just right since these are studio monitoring headphones.

On the downside, I am already noticing slight wear on the earcups (which I believe are replaceable).

Overall, for the price, the AKG 92 is a steal. If you're into classical music, jazz, easy or popular music, I'd recommend these highly. Go for them without a doubt.

Pros:

* 40 mm driver delivers good low bass frequencies (not too punchy)

* Low impedence (32 ohms) gives clear sound at low volume

* Audio frequency bandwidth: 16 - 22000 Hz gives bold bass, good midtone and clear treble (very good for the price)

* Earcups fit well (tightly) over the ears providing passive noise cancelling (not active)

* Very enjoyable for classical music, jazz, popular and general listening

* Fairly decent build quality (metal frame as opposed to full plastic)

Cons:

* Earcups degrade after a year of use

* As with any over ear headphones, your ears become hot after prolonged use (should not be a problem in cold weather or an air-conditioned environment)

* None otherwise; i'm not an audiophile, or someone who makes/produces music, so i didn't buy these with the intent of using them as ""studio monitors"". i just needed a set of comfortable, over-ear 'phones primarily for home use (not commute) that both look and sound good and don't cost a lot. very casual, regular usage; no professional stuff. and for someone with similar requirements, i would definitely implore them to check these out.

i love the design. no complaints wrt the material used. incidentally, i was planning on buying the cheaper k52s because of their all black body, but i decided against it because i prefer the cushioning on this one. the look is great too. these are probably the only pair of headphones that don't make me look crazy.

the comfort is decent. lmao i actually forgot that these have no adjustable slider thing and instead have the self-adjusting headband, but either way, it feels okay. the earcups are huge and so would completely engulf anyone's ears. i'm 6', have a relatively large head and ears, so these were actually good for me. none of that sharp pain you get from on-ears.
caveat: when you wear these, if your ears are big, especially if they are more ""out"" (basically, protrude outward from your head in a more noticeable way), then they might touch the inside of the cans, which feels... weird, for sure. it doesn't cause like immense discomfort, but it's still weird and does cause some strain after a while because your ears are literally pressing against the inside of the cup. also, after a while, your ears might feel warm too. not hot, just slightly warm.

the cord is, yes, very long. again, not a problem for me because i'm not using these while commuting. and i don't think these are sweatproof, waterproof, foldable, etc., but then again they're not made to be used on public transit üíÄ the context of use matters. they're meant for the studio and yeah, since we're all holed up in our houses anyway, they're great for use inside the house too, granted all you do is just listen to music and chill.

the sound quality is not remarkable or anything, but it's good enough! you won't find me raving about these for ""how amazing they sound"", but they do sound very good, especially for the price. no complaints with the sound quality esp. given the price.
although, a comparable alternative would be the oneodio headphones that a lot of reviewers really like and i did also consider them, but (personally) their design was too tacky and too close to an on-ear pair which only means one thing for people with big ears: pain. but yeah, none of that ""extra bass"" bs that i absolutely detest. the music sounds clear and balanced.

caveat: i keep reaching for the wire to change the song constantly forgetting that this doesn't have button controls (or even a mic, but hey, can't complain too much) üò≠ if you're someone who does want these extra features, check out the oneodio pair for sure.
also, the noise cancellation on these is... not good, period. like ""i could hear my fan through these when i wasn't playing anything"" not good. it's not terrible, but it's just not there, really.

and okay, i know there's a whole conversation about studio/monitor headphones not being compatible with regular smartphones involving a lot of technical jargon (""impedance"", ""impedance matching"", etc.), but i don't think you'd have to worry about that stuffl with these. i use these with my redmi note 10 pro to listen to spotify, google podcasts, local music and also to watch videos/movies on youtube, netflix, prime video and i haven't encountered any issues! i believe they'd work just fine with any modern smartphone.

in all, these are a great pair and i would say i'm satisfied with my purchase!; No microphone, no bluetooth, no noise cancellation, no branding markup. Everything you pay is for sound and build quality.

Very lightweight, flexible and self adjusting. Extremely comfortable for extended use. Clean, balanced, high resolution sound. Suitable for all kinds of audio.

Only note, you need a good port to get the most out of it. Works great on my computer. But when I plug it into my ps5 controller, it's fine. But not very loud.; The headphone is lightweight. It is over-the-ear, and my ear completely goes inside the cup. It does not press my ears, so it is very comfortable. The sound quality is awesome. The bass is very well balanced. You can hear every low pitch and high pitch, as well as every instrument in the music, very clearly. I use this to compose music in FL Studio. It is a nice headphone for gaming too. The cable is 3 meters long. I recommend this headphone for everyone, and for this price, it is a good deal.; I had two pairs of AKG240's in the past and several other brands since. All between $100 and $200 a set. These cans sound as good or better. Very defined. Good response! A little lacking in bass (hence the 4 rating) but they make up for it in overall definition and uncoloured sound. I hope to enjoy these for years to come. Great product!; Fone de √≥tima qualidade, muito confort√°vel. Voce pode ficar horas com o fone e nem percebe que est√° com o fone. O que eu achei ruim √© que o fone vem com um cabo grande (3 metros). √â muito cabo.; Excelente rango de respuesta audible, sin ser un equipo extra potente o extra bass, permite trabajar audio en sala, estudio o reproducir c√≥modamente m√∫sica para disfrute. Excelente desempe√±o con audio 3D-7D; Como en la caja te marca son para estudio son muy confortables te tapan toda la oreja el material es de muy buena calidad menos el cable es como los de iPhone buena calidad pero muy delicados y se escuchan muy bien; These are the best closed back headphones I've run across for the money with good bass, smooth sound throughout the range,and no particular coloration above the bass to the highs. The only two drawbacks would be that for closed back headphones, the isolation isn't the best, especially for smaller heads, and the overall sound character isn't as airy and open sounding with that almost laser imaging that can be achieved with the open backs, which would be at least twice the cost for those for such tonal balance as these. Sensitivity is also decent and not hard to drive with various headphone amps."

Previously I used Sony headphones but they're entry-level headphones. I also used headphones from other brands like Sennheiser, One Audio and JBL but all of them are entry-level headphones. This is the first time I bought high-end headphones and I trust Sony. You can't go wrong with Sony as per my experience. Coming to the headphones, I already knew that these were best. However, I researched thoroughly on YouTube and read many articles for almost 3 months before buying these. I want to get the best value for the price. These headphones are costly and I don't want to go wrong with my purchase decision.

Build quality: These are made of high-quality plastic and feel lightweight and comfortable to wear for longer durations. The only thing is, that the headband is thin and hurts a little on my head after wearing it for a few hours. Just move or adjust it a little and I'm good to go for another hour.

Sound quality: It's Sony, no need to brag about sound quality. Sony is known for sound clarity. Every small musical instrument is heard in great detail. I can't forget my first experience of listening to music using these headphones. I'm blown away by the details and the clarity of sound.

Battery life: It is mentioned 30 hours. Seems to be true. Headphones will easily last up to two days of mixed usage.

Noise cancellation (N.C.): These headphones are my first experience with noise cancellation. When NC is turned on, it is silent. Zero noise. But after a few days, I realised that I could still hear voices from other people when they were shouting or talking loudly. It's good not to completely block all sound.

Update on N.C.:
I want to address one thing people who are saying that NC is not good. I think they feel like that because of the adaptive NC feature in the Sony headphones app. Due to this feature, the level of Noise cancelling is adjusted automatically according to the surroundings. I know it doesn't work 100% accurately every time. It works sort of 70 - 80 % accurately depending on the surroundings. That's why some people complain that NC is not completely silent or perfect. Some are complaining there is no option to disable the adaptive NC feature. It is available in the Sony headphones app after the latest update. We can also manually disable the adaptive NC of headphones using the app. I mentioned these details because some people may not be aware of these features available in the headphones app.

Note: When NC is turned on, a sound pressure is created between ears and headphones. So there is a vacuum-like seal between ears and headphones and it blocks external sound. I'm not sure how NC works. This is the first time for me experienced noise cancellation. It was a shock and a surprise feeling when NC was on. My brother got scared due to this effect. I got used to it now. Check the Sony manual regarding the safety of NC. In the Sony Headphones Connect app, there is a safe listening setting. Please follow it and you don't need to worry about your ears getting damaged due to headphones. I have attached screenshots of the same. Please check.

Final Verdict: I can say that these headphones are the best consumer headphones. Audiophile headphones are different that's why I mentioned them as the best consumer headphones. Most people who use them will love them.; Amazing sound quality. I think the sound quality it right at the top when compared to similarly placed headphones like bose qc ultra, sennhieser momentum etc.
The anc works wonderfully. I was able to use it to save myself from all the drilling noise in my society.
Battery and operations are both really good. These lasts every long and very easy to operate.
App is brilliant with many customizations possible.

Having said that, they are not foldable so difficult to carry and have a big case. Also, built quality is slightly on the lower side. They do feel a bit delicate; Please excuse the long review!!
This is a review from someone who never used headphones.
I assumed that it‚Äôs going to be absolutely silent once I put on the headphones with ANC on.
It‚Äôs not absolutely silent, but it‚Äôs a lot better than direct noises from vehicles, horns and general noise outside.

When we try to play videos on laptop or mobile speakers, if there is noise from outside, we can‚Äôt make out the video sound. That issue is resolved with this. You can always hear the video sounds even with considerable amount of drilling and other noises in the background.

I never used headphones before. So I cannot compare them with anything or comment about the weight. However they are comfortable to wear. I never felt the urge to remove them. When I wore them for hours together, after removing them I felt a little tingling and numbness around the area the first day. But it‚Äôs probably because I never wore headphones.
Then I also noticed that after long hours of wearing, my ears started to hurt on the inside. I decided to limit the usage however comfortable they feel.

The first time I had some trouble connecting to laptop and mobile, but we can figure it out. It‚Äôs working seamlessly now and I know where and what to click if it doesn‚Äôt connect automatically.

I didn‚Äôt like the ambient sound. It feels strange with that on. I turned it off. Also I deactivated auto motion detection. For someone like me, speak to chat is also not suitable. Sometimes while watching an anime, when you say something out of excitement, it pauses the video. Ha ha‚Ä¶ Very well built. These are all personal preferences though.

Additional observations:
All these below points are without playing in the headphones.
You can hear the voices from TV with them. Voices won‚Äôt be cancelled out.
You can hear the person talking who is next to you.
It doesn‚Äôt cancel out hand blender noise. You can constantly hear it.
It doesn‚Äôt cancel the dogs barking from a distance. This is the most irritating thing.
It cannot nullify drilling noises completely. It reduces the intensity.
The day to day simple noises are almost nullified. This gives better call quality during teams calls.
I was told my voice quality improved a lot when I switched from laptop mic to xm5 mic.

With the drilling noise in the back, I tried to record my voice in a normal tone. The background noise is almost gone. However my voice itself sounded muffled. It wasn‚Äôt clear and a bit difficult to even make out the words.
On the other hand, when I recorded it using iPhone, the voice was clear but there was background noise too.

Overall the iPhone mic is the best. The audio sounds crystal clear when recorded on iPhone but of course background noise is heard.

When you turn on some other audio in headphones, like music at 40% sound, most of the outside is gone including drilling, horns, people talking in proximity. That is wonderful. üòÑ
I‚Äôm saying most because, drilling noise is quiet difficult to nullify.

Overall I like them. I‚Äôm going to use them a lot but for limited durations at a time.

Update after few weeks:
Sometimes the connection to laptop is seamless. Sometimes it troubles a lot. Yesterday it never connected at all. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. It could be a problem from laptop too.
Another things I noticed, when noise cancellation is on, and there is a certain amount of noise around you, it creates a pressure within the earcups. It is very evident if observed without music playing. This pressure is a bit less in ambient mode as this mode doesn‚Äôt cancel out everything. I realised that this is the reason why my ears hurt on the inside when I wear these. It could be probably because of the negative noise waves that are generated to cancel out the actual noise. The phenomenon is probably same for all active ANC devices. But xm5s are the first I‚Äôm trying.
When ANC is off and say the headphones themselves are off and you are wearing them, then there is is continuous sound that is generated like wind howling. So these cannot be used like this.

These devices cannot provide the natural peace we get when present in an actual place. I was hoping it‚Äôd be possible to some extent. But nope!; Tiene muy buen sonido, duraci√≥n de pila, comodidad, si estuche muy r√≠gido para mantenerlo bien protegido; ; Love these headphones. The Sony XM5s are an absolute game changer. I recommend them to everyone I know.

What really stands out is how incredibly comfortable they are. They're so lightweight and feel like you're wearing nothing at all, even during extended listening sessions. I've worn them for 12 hours straight with zero issues - the soft ear pads and ergonomic design never fatigue my ears or head. I could probably keep them on even longer!

Portability is another huge plus. The XM5s fold up compactly into a slim carrying case that easily slips into my bag when traveling. Their sleek, streamlined look also doesn't scream ""expensive headphones"" when wearing them out and about.

Of course, Sony delivers outstanding sound quality as you'd expect from their top-tier noise canceling line. Music is rich and immersive, with thumping bass. The noise cancellation is incredibly effective as well, allowing me to focus in noisy environments.

Setup was also a breeze - they pair seamlessly with all my devices over Bluetooth. Battery life is stellar too, lasting well over 24 hours per charge.

Simply put, the Sony XM5s have set a new standard for me in portable headphones that merge supreme comfort, elegant design, and high-fidelity audio. An all-around superb product that I can't recommend highly enough!; I am almost 65 years old SO, I DO NOT have the ears of a 18 year old. That said, I consider these to be good for these reasons:

A: Exceptional battery life.

B: Call quality that was considered good UNTIL I did a direct comparison to my Blueparrott B450-XT‚Äôs - NO WHERE NEAR the quality of the Blue 450‚Äôs, BUT the Blues are made specifically for calls in noisey environments. . Blues are in my opionion the defacto standard by which all other ANC phone calls should be judged. My ""demo"" for people is to run my upright vacuum cleaner whilst on a call. People on the other end cannot hear it AT ALL ‚Äì REALLY!, I hear them, and they hear me perfectly! TRULY amazing! I did the same test with these and alas they failed miserably in comparison. I expected that. I was told they sound like I am in a room away from the microphone, a bit fishtank like, and muddy. SO, they‚Äôll do in a call but not as a primary phone call device in noise. I heard a sample of the BOSE 700‚Äôs and they were terrible, which is what prompted me to get the Sony‚Äôs.

C: One unconventional thing they do great at: A Sleep Aid. Yup, they drown out all the extraneous noises like people talking, Air conditioners, fans, Water coolers, hums, etc. ALL gone with nothing playing through them!

I bought them primarily for playing on my PS5, and watching TV late at night. They do both quite well.

D: Amazingly, my ears do not sweat much in these even after prolonged use. I‚Äôve ordered those Dekoni Suede Earpads for them as well just for added comfort.
(https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS4T3X62?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)
(5/16/23 - Returned The earpads: they claim they are suede when in fact they are 2/3 suede. The inner part inside the cup is something else, not leather so NOT durable. Considering this, $49 seems FAR too expensive.)

E: They are long-term comfortable unless you have ears like a B-52 in which case you will probably be stuffing bits.

As for music, I find them to be more flat without pronounced highs or bass - which I prefer. The EQ on the app is a nice feature. The ANC works very well listening to music and will be adequate to the task in both quiet and noisey settings. Again, I remind you, I‚Äôm not 18. ;-)

Pricewise, they ARE a bit expensive but the build quality seems better than most.

If you have the time, I would HIGHLY recommend you test several brands and models at a store simply because sound quality is subjective and EVERYONE has their preference.
UPDATE: 5/23/23 - Returning (REPLACING) Headphones - Why? They started acting ""Funky"". By that, I mean that if you turn them off, they will not turn on unless you do not hit any buttons for about 15 sec. NOT normal. ALSO, they started to exhibit Connection issues that were NOT there initially. I STILL, at this point consider them excelllent. Now, if the NEW pair goes weird, THEN I would have to re-evaluate.
UPDATE 6-3-23: New pair are working as they should no connection issues or on/off bttun problems.
UPDATE 2-16-24: Still working perfectly and I use them nearly every night to sleep.; Headphone de alta qualidade ,chegou com 2 semanas de antecedencia,parabens ao vendedor ,r√°pido na postagem ,o fone √© leve ,confortavel ,cancelamento de ruido presente ,n√£o chega a zerar os barulhos ,mas faz uma grande diferen√ßa ,so nao acho o pre√ßo justo ,muito caro ,mesmo que o fone seja de alta qualidade ,√© muito caro ,sinceramente n√£o compraria novamente ."

On the downside, the build quality of the earphone cable raises concerns. Some users have reported that the wires are not as sturdy as expected, making them susceptible to damage and tangling. This weakness in the wire construction may impact the longevity of the earphones, requiring extra care and attention during use and storage.

The ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones come in a sleek design and are available in multiple color options, including Black, Blue, Green, Red, and White, allowing you to choose the one that suits your style.

In terms of technical specifications, the earphones have an impedance of 16 Œ© and a frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz. The 1.2-meter cable length provides adequate flexibility for comfortable usage.

It's important to note that these earphones come with a 6-month warranty, which provides some assurance in case of any manufacturing defects or malfunctions within the specified period.

In conclusion, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones offer decent sound quality and a comfortable fit, making them suitable for everyday use. However, the durability concerns surrounding the wire strength are worth considering. If you prioritize longevity and robustness in your earphone choice, you may want to explore other options. Nevertheless, if you handle them with care, these earphones can provide an enjoyable audio experience at an affordable price point.; The ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones present a mixed bag of features, catering to both audio quality enthusiasts and comfort seekers. With a snug fit and 10mm drivers, these earphones ensure a comfortable listening experience coupled with satisfactory sound performance. The passive noise cancellation feature enhances immersion by minimizing external distractions, ideal for music aficionados or those seeking solace in audiobooks during commutes.

Connecting these earphones is hassle-free, thanks to the straightforward plug-and-play mechanism. However, concerns arise regarding the durability of the earphone cable. Users have reported issues with wire sturdiness, highlighting susceptibility to tangling and damage. While the sleek design and color variety add aesthetic appeal, the compromise in build quality prompts cautious handling to prolong their lifespan.

Despite durability concerns, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones boast technical specifications such as a 16 Œ© impedance and a frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz. The 1.2-meter cable offers adequate flexibility for daily use. Additionally, the inclusion of a 6-month warranty provides reassurance against potential manufacturing defects, offering peace of mind to consumers.

In summary, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones deliver a comfortable fit and decent sound quality, suitable for regular use. However, prospective buyers should weigh the durability issues against their preferences. While these earphones offer an enjoyable audio experience at an affordable price point, those prioritizing longevity may opt for alternatives with sturdier construction. Nonetheless, with proper care, these earphones serve as a budget-friendly option for casual listeners.; The product is working except in Video Calls on WhatsApp; It's a good earphone with good quality music and base offered in this price range
But not for long use because of the thin wire it can break at any time
By the it's comfortable to wear to it and also is a good fit for small ear as well
The quality and Clarity in mic is just ok in this price; Sound quality is good but it's not very durable but I guess it's understandable for that price"

Sound Quality:
The sound quality of the Q20i is nothing short of exceptional. The headphones deliver a rich, balanced sound with crisp highs, deep lows, and a well-defined midrange. Whether I'm listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the audio reproduction is consistently impressive. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) feature effectively minimizes external noise, providing a more immersive and enjoyable listening experience.

ANC Performance:
The ANC on the Q20i works like a charm. It significantly reduces ambient noise, allowing me to focus on my music or conversations without any distractions. This feature has proven particularly useful during commutes and in noisy environments, making the Q20i a versatile companion for various settings.

Comfort and Design:
The comfort level of these headphones is outstanding. The memory foam ear cups provide a snug fit without causing discomfort, even during extended listening sessions. The adjustable headband ensures a secure and customizable fit. The sleek design and premium build quality add a touch of elegance, making these headphones not only functional but also stylish.

The battery life of the Q20i is impressive, easily lasting through extended use. The convenience of quick charging is an added bonus, ensuring that I never have to wait too long to get back to enjoying my favorite tunes.

Versatility:
I appreciate the versatility of the Q20i. The headphones come with a durable carrying case, making them travel-friendly. The foldable design allows for easy storage, and the inclusion of an aux cable ensures that I can continue using them even when the battery runs out.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Anker Soundcore Q20i headphones are a fantastic investment for anyone seeking a high-quality audio experience. From the impressive sound quality and effective ANC to the comfortable design and long-lasting battery life, these headphones deliver on all fronts. I highly recommend the Q20i to fellow music enthusiasts and anyone in search of reliable, feature-packed headphones with excellent value for money.; Buy it for its sound quality for the given price point under normal mode operations. Build quality is very sturdy and solid. Almost at par with some premium price headphones. If you like customizing the sound settings to your own taste, this is the headphone which gives you sufficient flexibility to do so. The default sound quality may not be of the highest standards and is more leaning towards higher bass notes. still the high notes are visible enough to compensate for the over powering lows. With the equalization settings you can fine tune these short comings and achieve absolute thrilling and enjoyable music tune. Dynamic range is respectable and the sound stage is great, engulfing you into the rythm. It is very light and comfortable to wear, just remember under the hot and swearty condition please avoid as the area around the ear cups will start sweating and become uncomfortable. Battery back up is awesome. without noise cancellation and under medium volume you can squeeze more than 60 hours easily. I am not a big fan of transparency mode, but it has its uses, which i think should be activated when you start speaking or some else speaks to you. the continous on under Transparency mode lets all the noises in to your headphone through the mic, which spoils the musical experiance. The noise cancellation is OK, the is a visible difference in sound quality the moment it is activated. which deafeats the purpose of listening to a good music. It requires a lot more refinement through firmware updates. But i guess at this price point one cannot expect much on noise cancellation front. Overall a great value for money product from soundcore.; I recently bought this headphone, so this is an early review of my experience using it

Overall
Pros - 1. It is budget friendly
2. It has a very good noise cancelling
3. Premium feeling
4. Very less or no sound leakage at full volume
5. The Transparency, Normal and NC works quite well
6. Charges very fast, 5 min=4 hr and within 90mins full charge
7. Contains a Type-C and 3.5mm Aux cable
8. Contains metal+plastic extension
9. Very soft cushion(ear pads)
10. The head cushion is also very soft
11. Can be folded
12. Good clamping force so it doesn't easily falls off
13. The mics work very nice
14. Very good sound quality if you can set the EQ properly
15. Nice comfort
16. Ear pads are replaceable

Cons - 1. As the clamping force is strong so wearing it for hours without opening may give you headache
2. Not for rigorous use as the plastic body can get scratches
3. No cover/pouch is not given so probably buy a headphone cover to take it for travels
4. The buttons are not very tactile and feels a bit wiggly
5. The EQ is not good as you need to set it according to your preference and it is very time consuming...the base soundcore preference is very bad but according to me the acoustic and piano were very good.
6. The Type-C cable is not very long
7. Even if the head cushion is soft, don't get tricked by its real like feeling as it is not real leather
8. Wearing around your neck can give you this heavy weighted feeling but it is not a major con for this headphone
9. The buttons are literally clamped into one single side, just need to get used to the buttons position

Overall it is a very good budget friendly noise cancelling headphone which I always wanted, it gives a similar experience like the ones of jbl770 nc or Sony ch720n...maybe the sound quality maybe be not soo good like them but what more can you expect from a ‚Çπ4500 headphones. Headphones of this price range also doesn't gives a similar experience like the q20i. I hope you liked the overall review!; Se escuchan muy bien, la bater√≠a les dura mucho y son c√≥modos, 100000/10 üò≠üò≠üíñüíñ; I have been using these headphones for a couple weeks and they are a great value. Sound quality isn't premium like Bose for my podcast listening but listening to tunes has been enjoyable. Certainly the quality is good enough for the price point. These headphones rest comfortably on my ears and are easy to turn on/off. Battery life has been superb so far. I like that you can fold up 1 side so they store a little more compactly. Was reasonably straightforward to connect to my phone and PC without downloading the app. You can slightly hear the noise cancelling when sitting in a quiet room, though it's not bothersome, and when I wore these for a walk I was almost stunned by my neighbors who I couldn't hear walking behind me. So the noise cancelling works. I certainly would buy these again.; Super casque, rapport qualit√© prix imbattable. Une batterie infatigable et une qualit√© sonore bien au dessus de tout les casques dans m√™me tranche de prix.; Vraiment bluff√© par le tarif
Autonomie √©norme, qualit√© du son tr√®s correct
Port agr√©able apr√®s qq heures d √©coute
Foncer, Anker une valeur s√ªre; Ik sta eigenlijk versteld van de prijs / kwaliteits verhouding, de geluidskwaliteit is erg goed en de noise cancelling werkt heel fijn!
Bouwkwaliteit is redelijk, jammergenoeg geen berscherm tasje of iets inbegrepen maar voor deze prijs is dat geen ramp.
Een aanrader voor de muziekliefhebber die graag met stilte wilt genieten!"

Well my review on this Zebronics headphones. Talking of build quality looks ok but a bit on the softer side it could show up damages as one uses it
Testing the output
I checked all parameters like the bass, treble,mid range sound highs and lows.
1.Bass check. I played Nothing else matters by Metallica. I was surprised it did sound great. The bass was good the lead guitar great drummer excellent,bass guitar perfect and rhythm guitar great.
2. Played Abba. ""Volez Vous"" Impressed again great output. The bass was fine, singing great too.
I will update my review after further testing this headphones.
Comfort factor
Not that good i would say. The ears do get caught up and one cannot wear the head set for a long time.
Noise cancellation.
Not really that effective.
It's a good headset to listen to your music. I haven't tested the calling feature which requires the inbuilt mic. Cable length just fine. It's a simple headset at a good price too. Though one cannot expect more juice out of it as compared to high end ones
One shot. Good for it.; One of the worst headset I have ever buy in 1 months it work fine but after that 1 month the mics was not working the noise was not coming good do Liberty is not good it is the one of the first headphone I have ever seen in my life I put not recommend anybody to buy this headset this is a one of the bus headset in my entire life and I am not going to buy Zebronics product again and when it is not working fine I try to claim warranty but there was no warranty; Very sleek and apt product, value for money and clear sound quality.; Sound quality is good and base is good. But cannot wear for more than 1 hour as it starts to cause pain in ear due to incorrect size. The speaker size is small for most ear sizes and so it does not fit properly causing discomfort.; The quality of the sound is good; The head phones have great bass and is very durable and good quality but it's is not comfortable for more than 15 mins the earmuffs are smaller than you expect.; Audio quality is okay.. but wire quality is not good.."

So I had with 0 expectations reading the reviews I got it for a good price at 2800 so i just went for it.
At first when I got the headphones I was dissapointed when I heard coz I put max volume on my phone nd the bass nd sound was low BUT THATS THE MISTAKE I THINK MOST PPL PUTTING THE REVIEWS COZ THATS DEFAULT SOUND which is very low
You will have to put a song or play video it won't work otherwise AND THEN MANUALLY INCREASE THE SOUND BY CLICKING THE VOLUME BUTTONS ON THE HEADPHONES TILL U HERE A SOUND TICK SOUND WHICH MEANS IT REACHED MAX VOLUME.
I did not know this I just found it and UFF the sound and bass increased SIGNIFICANLTY.
SO REMEMBER TO DO THIS THIS WHEN U BUY THE HEADPHONES
After doing that And you still want even more bass and sound then idk do you want ur head to explode or somethin coz it has VERY LOUD AND GOOD SOUND AND BASS!!
OH Yes it's comfortable too not for too long but enough time life 5 or 6 hrs IF u have big ears it might hurt after sometime but for me it's PERFECT.; I have been using the headphones (TUNE 760) for more than a month, here is my review

At first (2 days of purchasing) I was very disappointed because I felt that the sound quality was very lacking, the base and loudness disappointed me, but after a week, it started to sound very very good, I think it needed a burn period, because this headphone is now sounding very very good for me.

Build Quality - the build quality is good, no major issues, the pad is soft.

Comfort - the headphone is comfortable, but one issue is that the clamping force is a bit tight, maybe because I have a big head. Another thing is, even though this is an over read headphone it is not that big, so some part of my ear gets a bit uncomfortable after long use, but if u adjust and find the correct comfortable position, you cab wear it for a long time, I watched a 3 hr movie without any issues

Battery - omg, one of the best part of this headphone, claims 50 hr without noise cancellation, I think it lives upto the mark. You don't have to worry about battery

Sound quality - I'm not an audiophile, let me clear it up. The sound quality I felt was really good and I was very impressed, after the burn in period, so if you are buying this give it at least 1 week before judging it, trust me it really really gets better. The base was not that high, but not lacking also, was upto the mark.

Noise cancellation - it wasn't really that great, could slightly reduce the fan noise that's it, I wouldn't say it is useless, but not that bad either, could reduce the noise of tv from next room when I listened to music, so it did came in handy also with noise cancellation the sound quality I felt improved a bit.

Conclusion - as I said, I was really disappointed at first with the purchase, thought I wasted the money(6.5k) but now I'm really really enjoyed it, watching movies was the best experience with dolby music profile in my phone. I'd say it is really worth the money if ur looking for a headphone around 7k; Pros: good sturdy build and good connectivity and battery life, and aesthetically looks good on you. Active Noise Cancelling is great too.

Cons (likely):

* Charging port doesn't allow for using while charging. I had this in my last headphones (non-brand, cheaper!) and it's so convenient that you miss it and curse whoever is lacking behind in this basic feature. But the good battery backup leaves you plenty time to recharge.

* Too tight. Again, a basic feature IMO to make it feather light which again, a lot of cheaper non-brand headphones are offering, such a shame to see it lacking too. Ears will get hot even in winter/AC. But great if you're a runner, they won't come off.

* Multipoint connection is better than others as it allows you to fully switch between two devices rather divide the audio between calling and music mode. BUT again, the only downside (that maybe only I'm seeing on my Windows PC) that when I switch away from it to my phone, my pc gets entirely disconnected (unlike Android that puts the connection on standby) and I have to re-connect from windows after switching back to it.

* Very little bass. And I feel like ANC might me filtering some of it out, especially at large volume, as the most bass I get at is weirdly at ~80% volume.

Verdict: Well budgeted ANC headphones with lots of good features.; battery and durability -amazing,
sound quality and comfort -great,
noise cancellation -okayish,
mic quality -absolute trash.

all the other reviews speak about the sound quality. it's great in that aspect. nothing special to comment about

These headphones are super tough and last a long time, which is awesome. One thing though, you can't use them while charging, like the Apple mouse. But hey, they charge crazy fast ‚Äì 30-40% in a few minutes, and fully in just 1.5 hours. So, even though you can't use them while charging, you'll be back to wireless mode pretty quickly.

the headphones seem to not have enough processing power to provide good mic quality alongside good sound quality. and when you turn on noise cancelling the mic quality gets even worse. I can't attend calls when im outside, the mic pics up too much noise.

They boot up in noise-canceling mode, which can be useful but drains the battery unnecessarily when not needed. Additionally, they don't automatically power down if noise-cancelling remains active, leading to overnight battery depletion.; Item is good but bass is not as per jbl quality. Further, ear comfort is less. Thank you; These headphones have saved me with the outside disturbance. I purchased it because of Noise cancellation and easy usage. Headphones look classy and the sound quality is amazing. It has both Bluetooth and wired connectivity which comes in handy. Buttons are very helpful to switch from non-NC to NC and even change to next or previous collection. Mic quality works without any disturbance..

It has Awesome sound. Smart appearance and good durability. Go for it..don't think twice.; Looks little flimsy, but good quality audio. So happy to buy philips products.; At ‚Çπ 300-350 price range product is okay.
But do not expect sound quality like Sony or OnePlus.
Too sharp sound
Over all quality 5/10
Finish is okay as expected.; Good product
Sound quality is good üëç; Within 8/9days only one of the earphones stopped funtioning. It seems that there is hardly any quality control. And you have to run a lot to get a replacement.; It's a good product for those who are looking for earphones with ambidextrous nature (don't have to check which one is for right, which one is for left all the time..it fits both ears easily) and decent enough audio

Cons:
1. Not the best for pro music appreciators.. for that you may have to buy higher end models of Phillips, Sennheiser or jbl etc

2. No volume controls; Superb product andhas superb sound too. However, two extra ear bud of different sizes are missing. Wire is very thin. Overall quality is acceptable.; Better than local products. Sound quality is also good and balance. Good for students and pleasant music but not bass is not too high for rock music."

If getting this around 2000/- INR than it's good deal .Not easy to carry in small bag , take care; Crystal clear quality with great bass. Very strong and sturdy. Only problem is the weight.

These get a daily workout on the computer and dj equipment.; I don't like that it leaks sound but the sound quality is great for the price i recommend this product; Hola! Voy a comenzar aclarando que el pedido llego justo el d√≠a de hoy as√≠ que mis impresiones son muy tempranas, as√≠ que puede que me este dejando llevar un poco por la emoci√≥n.

La verdad es que estoy impresionado, en cuanto los sacas de su empaque el producto se ve de muy buena apariencia, algo ligeros pero nada que asuste. Las almohadillas son muy c√≥modas, el colch√≥n de la diadema es justo, no es incre√≠ble, pero es bastante c√≥modo, hay muchos productos de este precio que no tienen ni eso.
Los cables auxiliares que vienen con los aud√≠fonos son buenos, decentes al menos. Tambi√©n vienen con una bolsita para cargar los aud√≠fonos, que tampoco es la gran cosa, pero es un buen agregado.

En cuanto al sonido, la verdad es que son excelentes. No poseo aud√≠fonos de alta gama, pero si he probado varios aud√≠fonos en mi trabajo (Soy editor de video en un estudio de mi ciudad) y la verdad es que como primer impresi√≥n, no me parece que le pidan mucho a modelos como los Audio-Technica M20X.

Si bien no son aud√≠fonos que se recomiendan para producci√≥n o monitoreo de audio, sinceramente creo que tienen un poco de ambos mundos, la respuesta de audio parece ser lo suficientemente buena como para edici√≥n de video o audio sencilla, as√≠ como para uso de entretenimiento. Los bajos no son abrumadores como lo ser√≠an en unos Beats, hay muy buen espaciado entre los sonidos de la m√∫sica, la voz es clara y el aislamiento pasivo es muy bueno.

Veo porque muchos se ir√≠an por unos aud√≠fonos como los ath-m20x u otras opciones de la misma gama, pero la verdad es que creo que como aud√≠fonos de d√≠a a d√≠a me parecen mejor opci√≥n, m√°s c√≥modos e incluso m√°s lindos a la vista... Con el extra de que su respuesta es lo suficientemente buena como para trabajar de forma un poco m√°s profesional."

Liked the place where buttons configured on the left cup and looks premium. Grey and golden makes it classy. Audio jack included and connects well. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.
Thank you very much,
Your customer Armaan."

Designed specifically for ultimate bass, these headphones deliver an audio experience like no other. Whether I'm listening to music or watching a movie, it genuinely feels like I'm sitting in a theatre.
The bass is incredibly deep and powerful. Comfort is another standout feature
Overall, the Sony ULT Headphones are simply awesome. If you're a bass enthusiast or just looking for a high-quality audio experience, these headphones are a fantastic choice. Highly recommended!; At this price segment it's the best headphone with preety good built quality and best sound system (if you are some one who wants to enjoy each and every node of music then I would suggest not to hit ULT or if you are some one who likes to grove on bass then ULT will make sure even your soul groves on it) along with ANC. It's completely value for money.; Pros-
1.You have Touch volume control (on the right side of the headphone u need to swipe up to increase and swipe down to decrease volume)

2.ANC the best in class perfect while using in hotels/flights

3.better comfort than 1000XM5

4.Deep Awesome Bass

5. Auto-off while removing headphone

Cons-

1.Breakable (need to be careful while folding)

2.Avoid touching the inner parts of the headphone (contains thin cloth that is tearable)

3.Battery Life :(

4.No Guide in app for Newbie Sony user on App

5.Non-Premium Build; Upgraded to these bad boys from the WH1000XM3. What a difference. You can't go wrong with these headphones. Just go for them . Bass is tight on ULT setting 2 and out of this world while maintaining the mids and highs. Makes music listening such a pleasure.
It's like having subwoofers in headphones. Worth every penny; Mind blowing bass and a thrilling audio quality, packed in a pair of headphones so light and comfortable that you just can‚Äôt go wrong with it!! Battery life is great too. Best headphones purchased till date! Huge step up from WH-XB910N. Go for it!; The headsets are a bang for your bucks, the quality is extremely premium to feel and the Bass, OMG, you're gonna love it...; Literally killing every segment right now. Ult button works like charm. Killing in every segment. Great comfort and can use for long hours hassle free also great battery life.; Classic Sony sound; je recommande au gens ce casque fonctionne bien; Los aud√≠fonos son simpmemente escepcionales!!

Ten√≠a mis dudas en comprarlos pero me ayud√© de varios reviews en youtube y realmente muchos si no es que todos comentaban que eran de los mejores del mercado al momento, sobre todo en costo/beneficio es un equilibrio muy balanceado, si bien comentan que tanto de la marca misma como de otras hay mejores aud√≠fonos, estos no juegan nada mal y realmente compiten con varios modelos de costos mayores... Sin duda muy recomendables!!!

Ahor bien en cuanto al producto, anteriormente ten√≠a usaba unos WH-CH520, el audio es bueno, pero los bajos son cortos ya que es un aspecto que no cubren los audifonos sin embargios los medios y agudos son bastante buenos, pero con estos ULT, los medios y los agudos se oyen cristalinos y los bajos ni se diga sobre todo con el modo ULT1, es el balance perfecto del bass, ya que por un amigo he usado unos crusher y los bajos ah√≠ son brutales llegando casi al l√≠mite donde se sienten molestos (en mis gustos personales claro) estos el bajo no es tan alucinante como en ellos, sin embargo, los siento m√°s firmes, m√°s definidos!!!

En cuanto a la cancelaci√≥n de audio, es muy buena, si bien no es perfecta si disminuye el ruido exterior considerablemente y si a esto le sumamos el buen nivel de volumen que tiene, no tendr√°s problema en perderte en tu m√∫sica un rato est√©s donde est√©s, por otro lado el modo ambiente es de lo mejor que he escuchado, se escucha pr√°cticamente igual que si no los llevaras puestos es excelente!!!

Y en cuanto a la comodidad, la verdad es que si son algo pesados a comparaci√≥n de algunos otros modelos que he tenido, sin embargo al ser supraurales y tener un buen acolchamiento en las almohadillas, no se sienten tanto, lo que si es que se sienten muy abrigadores y en mi caso particular si me hacen sudar un poco, cosa que soluciono con un ventilador personal de escritorio ya que los uso principalmente para trabajar

En t√©rminos generales son perfectos, considerando, costo/beneficios, calidad de audio y calidad de construcci√≥n ya que aparte de todo, Sony argumenta que la construcci√≥n de estos aud√≠fonos es con pl√°sticos reciclados as√≠ aparte de todo apoyamos al planeta; Sony headphones have honestly been a hit or miss for me, but I've always been a fan of their products. The ULT wear are the absolute BEST sony headphones I've tested to date. This one is definitely for the bass lovers. The quality is very good for the price range, nice and light on head and great materials. Battery life is in line with the XM5, expected to get around 30-50hrs( All really depends on usage). The sound out the box with no tweaks is a quite pleasant warm sound signature thats easy on the ears, but these have the sony ‚ÄúHeadphones‚Äù app for you to tune them to your liking and play around with some preset EQ modes( My personal EQ is on the review pics). The party really begins with the ULT button, so let me explain them individually!
ULT off - depending on your EQ, the headphones will sound like that, with no boost to the bass, but still present
ULT 1- Adds a nice deep boost to the bass that you can feel while keeping your eq consistent!
ULT 2- the headphones just turned into subwoofers!, boosting the bass to where you now are feeling the music!, its incredible!

Noise cancelation and aware modes are right up there with the top of the line Xm5. Even with the bass at its peak performance, there is no distortion when either of these modes are on even at high volumes!

At $199 retail, they are worth every penny!

Whenever on sale, snag a pair for sure!; Sound, quality and functionality is what you expect from Sony. However,the truly heavy bass is a nice change and a flashback to what Sony was in the 90s...back when everyone was responsible for their own hearing, and not the company. If you don't like it you can turn it off. Mic quality on calls is good so far. Noise reduction is very good. Comfortable and the app allows alot of control over sound and function.
For background I've worked in music production for years, and I grew up in a musical family. It's not a high end studio headset but worth the price for good quality and awesome bass.
I definitely recommend.; The Sony ULT WEAR Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones have Massive Bass and Comfortable Design. They come in a nice quality packaging, and include a hard shell zippered protective storage case that allow the headphones to be folded in the storage case to reduce size. The case also holds the included USB-C cable and audio phono cable

Controls on the headphones.

Left side controls

AN/AMB:
- Press once for Noise Reduction, to remove outside sounds
- Press again for Ambient Noise to hear outside sounds

The AN feature is useful in a noisy environment such as on a plane to remove the noise while watching a movie or listening to music, and the AMB feature allows you to hear outside noise while headphones are on.

Power button:
- Press and hold 2 seconds to turn On/Off

ULT button: For Bass level
- Press once for level 1, twice for level 2

I find there is a slight difference in BASS, but not really noticeable.

USB-C port:
- Charging port for the internal battery (USB-A to USB-C cable included)

Cable is only 6 inches long, so headphones will need to be close to the USB power source.

3.5mm audio port:
- Standard audio port for use with legacy devices that don‚Äôt have Bluetooth capability. (4 ft. Phono cable included)

This is useful on a flight to connect to legacy media devices of the plane enabling the use of the AN feature of the headphones.

Right side controls:

The right side headphone has a touchpad to control the following functions.

- Double tapping once stops play, double tapping again resumes play
- Swipe back for previous track
- Swipe forward for next track
- Swipe Up and hold to raise volume
- Swipe Down and hold to lower volume
- Hold finger on touchpad to access voice commands (ex. Siri on iOS)
- Place hand on touchpad to quickly access ambient sound which lowers audio volume to hear someone talk (without having to remove Headphones), remove hand restores audio volume.

Using the touchpad functions is easy but requires some patience and practice.

Note. When removing the headphones, audio will automatically stop and resume when placed back on your head.

Before using the headphones, I fully charged the internal battery and installed the Sony Headphones Connect app for iOS, (the app is available for both iOS and Android) and I signed up for a free Sony account to register the Headphones.

I launched app on my phone and pressed power button 2 seconds to turn on Headphones and then 7 seconds to pair with my phone.

Note: 2 devices can be simultaneously linked once paired.

The Headphones options in the app has Status, Sound, System and Services tabs to provide information and configuration options for the Headphones. The Activity option in the app has tabs to log your listening history, daily use, safe listening and badge rewards for using features in the app.

Once settings in the app are configured to your tastes, it is not required to actually use the Headphones, but useful to have.

I‚Äôm an avid music lover of all genres and these Headphones provide a great listening experience with clear sounds and Massive Bass. With these on, I can enjoy my music without disturbing anyone.

The battery life is very good (at least 30 hours) which is great.

I have a fairly large head and the Headphones adjust well on my ears and provide a comfortable fit.

When I travel by plane, the Noise Reduction feature is useful to cut outside sounds when listening to music and/or movies on my phone or tablet. The wired phono cable is useful for times I want to Connect to legacy devices that do not have Bluetooth capability.

Overall extremely satisfied with these Headphones."

We make that happen for you with Tru Bass, Tru Balance and Tru Rock.; 10mm Driver:- Dive into the world of balanced audio quality.; ENC for superior calling:- Experience a clear calling experience when you talk on the phone with Environmental Noise Cancellation.; Low Latency (up to 50ms):- Gaming, talking or listening to music - it‚Äôs a lag-free zone with up to 50ms of low latency.; Sporty elegant design:- Designed for flexibility and comfort, making your audio experience look as great","The FIRST and primary features is the microphone. The other person in line can hear my voice crystal clear and without any background noise. (Most of the bluetooth headphones have unpleasant background noise and with the person on the other end not hearing us properly )

SECONDLY, the battery back up is incredible. It can last a day with frequent use and lose only about 10%-20% of the total capacity.

THIRDLY, the buttons are placed distinctly and protruding, which makes it very convenient. (Yes flat buttons are confusing and we tend to press the wrong ones)

FOURTH point is that the bass quality is pretty good.
Other advantages includes good quality plastic and wire material, even the ear plugs are soft and comfortable. The magnet also works well and the bluetooth doesn't get disconnected even when they gets attached. (some bluetooth gets disconnected when the magnet gets attached or kept un used for a while, which i find it very inconvenient)

The ONLY DISADVANTAGE i find is that even the lowest volume is loud for me, especially while using it at night or when your surrounding is calm.; I actually purchased this product as I was tight on budget. I searched for a lot of neckbands and bought this. Here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
1. The build quality and look of the neckband feels premium and durable compared to Mivi collar 2

2. Sound quality is quite good..it gets loud enough but not too loud. Bass is on point and overall you get a very well balanced sound quality.

3. The battery life is simply amazing. It lasts for about 3 days and my usage is 3-4 hours per day.

4. It has a Qualcomm chipset which is okayish for this price point. Noice cancellation is also average.

5. It supports dual pairing- this means that you can connect upto 2 devices with this neckband and the audio switches automatically as you go from one device to another (however I noticed a delay of 2-3 seconds).

6. Mic quality is good enough. The other person can hear clearly.

Cons:

1. You do not get AptX or AptX HD. For those who don‚Äôt know these are Bluetooth audio codecs. You can google it out and see which audio codecs does your phone support. If you are an iPhone user like me then you can use this as iPhone only supports AAC codec.

2. You do not get a thumping bass. So for bass lovers I do not recommend this. If you like a more balanced and crisp sound then go for it.

3. Latency - as it does not have AptX HD so it has latency while gaming compared to Boat rockerz 335 and OnePlus wireless buds (YouTube, prime, netflix works fine)

4. It has micro usb port. This product was launched in 2020 but still has a micro usb port instead of a type C.

5. There is a hissing sound continuously on this and boat rockerz which I did not notice on mivi collar 2

Conclusion: Well if the pros and cons did not help you out then here are my final thoughts on this. If you are someone who likes to listen to a lot of music and not overwhelming bass then this product is really good. The battery life is great you get atleast 10 hours of battery on 80-90% volume. It‚Äôs not for gaming so don‚Äôt buy it just for gaming purpose.; Nice product, Batery life is also good & sound quality is marvellous; I have to change my mind its worthless stopped working in a usage of short duration, i request that kindly ignore below conclusion, its useless don't go with it

In this Review i will be covering good and bad aspect and how genuinely it seems to me at first sight, it depends on insight and experiences and gives you general idea about whether you should purchase it or not, following points given below:-

Prosüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

Delivery:-i am restless kid who don't believe in waiting, trust me Amazon,s key point that will never disappoint and never want you to wait so long. The only exception is that when order reaches from other city then it takes 4 to 5 days, which as per the usual process considerable

Box Content:- it comes with noise registration leaflet, manual, micro usb cable, extra pair of earbuds

Connectivity:-Its perfect but lags somehow, its hard to proceed far away. Mainly it depends on obstacles how it works.

Battery:- i haven't charged it since the day product arrived and with mixed usage, battery level not yet reduced despite of mixed and moderate use. And still manage to be at 80%.

Sound quality:-
Considering the price point, audio is just perfectly balanced the good point is its a blend of perfect tuning. Seperation of instruments and vocal can be easily identified. In short music lovers will start loving it, apart from that extra bass is just gimmick. Else its brilliant and produce best sound, songs feels bit low and average in normal mode but when turn to extra bass mode then the sound accompanied by bass. In short its sound and audio is just perfect for what is right, balanced thats what made it so different. Trust me i was skeptical and i returned 6 to 7 earphones and headphones just because they have not met my expectations but it stands on my expectations, brilliant work.

Cons:-üëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

Bass:-üòî
To remind that functional button is there change the mode from normal to extra bass, its just a gimmick and need a thoughtful touch before introducing it.it doesn't work that way they condemn it.

Build quality:- no doubt its perfect, but its earbuds are quite old fashioned, design is just overtly laid which were downside and i don't like that much.

Noise cancellation:- There is no reduction of noise however its one bad aspect considering the price points

Ear buds:- Doesn't fit well in my ears, its not that they came but it seems to be loosened and noise could have given in ear design,metal housing is not there, and earbuds were overtly designed, its modern trend to have in ear design which fits perfect and it lacks these qualitiesüòî

Conclusionüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

bought these neckband although this could be premium and stay around for a while, to say its premium and classy but can't beat boat rockers 255 in terms of bass. Apart from bass its perfect comparing to boat rockers, dont know about the durability, At first glance these neckbands are show stealers. Trust me sound quality is what you need then you may go for it, considering its bad aspect you may also prefer to ignore; This neckband is good for general use, if you lookinh for bass‚Äî don't buy it.
however sound quality is pretty good in terms of clear audio. But Music Lovers, it's not for you.

Magnetic Tips are just to keep it together, it doesn't have any function!
When you connect tips ‚Äî
‚Ä¢ it doesn't pause your music
‚Ä¢ it doesn't Disconnect your BT.

i found BOAT ROCKERZ much better purchase in terms for functionality and music.

And there is no RETURN POLICY. so purchase it wisely.; Really appreciate your product for it's good quality sound, unique design and great looks. Keep going. Thank you."

(5 stars for sound / 4 stars for build quality)

AKG is an Austrian company, now owned by Harman International of the famous harman/kardon brand of hi-fi equipment and JBL.

If you're looking for a good pair of budget headphones for an Immersive listening experience, the K92 is perfect. They may not be the best looking ones, but the metal frame makes them quite sturdy, while most expensive brands are made completely of plastic.

I bought these headphones purely for listening to music via my computer. The ear cups of my previous (decent) AKG K52s had become scruffy so I wanted to change and after scouting several hi-fi audio websites, decided to upgrade to the K92 which had good recommendations as opposed to the K72.

The headphones deliver crisp, clear sound with no or minimal distortion (depending on your audio source or file). They have have a good audio frequency bandwidth (16 - 22000 Hz) which provides a wide dynamic range which means you get bold bass and clear treble. The low impedence of 32 ohms means that the headphones can be driven easily at low volume by a computer sound card without the need for an additional amplifier. A 40 mm driver delivers good bass which is not too punchy, but just right since these are studio monitoring headphones.

On the downside, I am already noticing slight wear on the earcups (which I believe are replaceable).

Overall, for the price, the AKG 92 is a steal. If you're into classical music, jazz, easy or popular music, I'd recommend these highly. Go for them without a doubt.

Pros:

* 40 mm driver delivers good low bass frequencies (not too punchy)

* Low impedence (32 ohms) gives clear sound at low volume

* Audio frequency bandwidth: 16 - 22000 Hz gives bold bass, good midtone and clear treble (very good for the price)

* Earcups fit well (tightly) over the ears providing passive noise cancelling (not active)

* Very enjoyable for classical music, jazz, popular and general listening

* Fairly decent build quality (metal frame as opposed to full plastic)

Cons:

* Earcups degrade after a year of use

* As with any over ear headphones, your ears become hot after prolonged use (should not be a problem in cold weather or an air-conditioned environment)

* None otherwise; i'm not an audiophile, or someone who makes/produces music, so i didn't buy these with the intent of using them as ""studio monitors"". i just needed a set of comfortable, over-ear 'phones primarily for home use (not commute) that both look and sound good and don't cost a lot. very casual, regular usage; no professional stuff. and for someone with similar requirements, i would definitely implore them to check these out.

i love the design. no complaints wrt the material used. incidentally, i was planning on buying the cheaper k52s because of their all black body, but i decided against it because i prefer the cushioning on this one. the look is great too. these are probably the only pair of headphones that don't make me look crazy.

the comfort is decent. lmao i actually forgot that these have no adjustable slider thing and instead have the self-adjusting headband, but either way, it feels okay. the earcups are huge and so would completely engulf anyone's ears. i'm 6', have a relatively large head and ears, so these were actually good for me. none of that sharp pain you get from on-ears.
caveat: when you wear these, if your ears are big, especially if they are more ""out"" (basically, protrude outward from your head in a more noticeable way), then they might touch the inside of the cans, which feels... weird, for sure. it doesn't cause like immense discomfort, but it's still weird and does cause some strain after a while because your ears are literally pressing against the inside of the cup. also, after a while, your ears might feel warm too. not hot, just slightly warm.

the cord is, yes, very long. again, not a problem for me because i'm not using these while commuting. and i don't think these are sweatproof, waterproof, foldable, etc., but then again they're not made to be used on public transit üíÄ the context of use matters. they're meant for the studio and yeah, since we're all holed up in our houses anyway, they're great for use inside the house too, granted all you do is just listen to music and chill.

the sound quality is not remarkable or anything, but it's good enough! you won't find me raving about these for ""how amazing they sound"", but they do sound very good, especially for the price. no complaints with the sound quality esp. given the price.
although, a comparable alternative would be the oneodio headphones that a lot of reviewers really like and i did also consider them, but (personally) their design was too tacky and too close to an on-ear pair which only means one thing for people with big ears: pain. but yeah, none of that ""extra bass"" bs that i absolutely detest. the music sounds clear and balanced.

caveat: i keep reaching for the wire to change the song constantly forgetting that this doesn't have button controls (or even a mic, but hey, can't complain too much) üò≠ if you're someone who does want these extra features, check out the oneodio pair for sure.
also, the noise cancellation on these is... not good, period. like ""i could hear my fan through these when i wasn't playing anything"" not good. it's not terrible, but it's just not there, really.

and okay, i know there's a whole conversation about studio/monitor headphones not being compatible with regular smartphones involving a lot of technical jargon (""impedance"", ""impedance matching"", etc.), but i don't think you'd have to worry about that stuffl with these. i use these with my redmi note 10 pro to listen to spotify, google podcasts, local music and also to watch videos/movies on youtube, netflix, prime video and i haven't encountered any issues! i believe they'd work just fine with any modern smartphone.

in all, these are a great pair and i would say i'm satisfied with my purchase!; No microphone, no bluetooth, no noise cancellation, no branding markup. Everything you pay is for sound and build quality.

Very lightweight, flexible and self adjusting. Extremely comfortable for extended use. Clean, balanced, high resolution sound. Suitable for all kinds of audio.

Only note, you need a good port to get the most out of it. Works great on my computer. But when I plug it into my ps5 controller, it's fine. But not very loud.; The headphone is lightweight. It is over-the-ear, and my ear completely goes inside the cup. It does not press my ears, so it is very comfortable. The sound quality is awesome. The bass is very well balanced. You can hear every low pitch and high pitch, as well as every instrument in the music, very clearly. I use this to compose music in FL Studio. It is a nice headphone for gaming too. The cable is 3 meters long. I recommend this headphone for everyone, and for this price, it is a good deal.; I had two pairs of AKG240's in the past and several other brands since. All between $100 and $200 a set. These cans sound as good or better. Very defined. Good response! A little lacking in bass (hence the 4 rating) but they make up for it in overall definition and uncoloured sound. I hope to enjoy these for years to come. Great product!; Fone de √≥tima qualidade, muito confort√°vel. Voce pode ficar horas com o fone e nem percebe que est√° com o fone. O que eu achei ruim √© que o fone vem com um cabo grande (3 metros). √â muito cabo.; Excelente rango de respuesta audible, sin ser un equipo extra potente o extra bass, permite trabajar audio en sala, estudio o reproducir c√≥modamente m√∫sica para disfrute. Excelente desempe√±o con audio 3D-7D; Como en la caja te marca son para estudio son muy confortables te tapan toda la oreja el material es de muy buena calidad menos el cable es como los de iPhone buena calidad pero muy delicados y se escuchan muy bien; These are the best closed back headphones I've run across for the money with good bass, smooth sound throughout the range,and no particular coloration above the bass to the highs. The only two drawbacks would be that for closed back headphones, the isolation isn't the best, especially for smaller heads, and the overall sound character isn't as airy and open sounding with that almost laser imaging that can be achieved with the open backs, which would be at least twice the cost for those for such tonal balance as these. Sensitivity is also decent and not hard to drive with various headphone amps."

Pros:

Punchy Bass: These earphones live up to the JBL name by delivering satisfying bass that makes music enjoyable, especially bass-heavy genres like hip-hop and EDM.
√ºberraschend (√ºberraschend is German for surprisingly) Clear Mids and Highs: Despite the bass focus, the mids and highs aren't totally drowned out. You can still hear vocals and instruments clearly.

Overall:

The JBL C50HI wired in-ear headphones are a solid choice for budget-minded listeners who prioritize clear sound with a punchy bass.

Bye bye.

For those who want all goods and bads here they are:

1. Build Quality
a. On Ear headphones (not over ear headphones)
b. Lighter overall weight than its competitors (187 grams)
c. Neither too Sturdy not too Flimsy
d. Foldable (earcups)
e. Chance for fingerprint attraction
f. Very precisely fits my beefy head
g. Ear cups are soft and will suit if u have average sized ears
h. Matte finish (surface is not reflective)
i. Fit on my ears is rather small and its not as good as over head earphones.

2. Sound Quality
a. Great Noise Cancellation for this price
b. Volume can get pretty loud
c. Heavy Audio leakage
d. Great Bass
e. Mids are decent

3. Ports & Buttons
a. USB - C charging port
b. 3.5mm headphone Jack
c. SD Card slot that supports my 32GB Sandisk
d. Tactical buttons usable for almost all media controls including voice assistant

4. One Year Warranty card which u should claim

5. Battery life good lasted me 5 days for a power user like me

6. Audio Quality is great - Very balanced instead of fancy stuff like Bass boosted, etc. Thus giving user the control to equalize their songs.

7. Bluetooth Connectivity is alright, only once out of a week did it struggle to connect to my phone but still whenever I turn on my bluetooth pairs up quickly.

8. Take occassional breaks while using this as earcups are big enough to cover the hollow parts of your ear at the same time fitting perfectly on top of my skeletal structures thus creating pain with continous usage.; Mic doesnt work properly, apparently only works with bluetooth mode - why????
Has issues connecting with bluetooth.
Sound quality not good.
Also it is not comfy for the ears.; Not at all good !! Connect issue, sound is okay not like other brands too heavy dont know for what reason/no proper mic; I've had my headphones for a while now, and I'd like to share my thoughts on them. Let's start with the not-so-great aspects:

‚ñ°Bad Qualities ‚ñ°
1. Defective Headphone
From day one, I noticed a significant issue with the right side of my headphones. When I turn the volume up to the maximum or above the recommended level, it starts making loud and disturbing noises like ""zzz zzz"" alongside the audio I'm listening to. This makes it quite challenging to understand what's being played. Fortunately, I usually keep the volume at a moderate level, so it's manageable for me. I considered getting them replaced, but the reputation of noise company' poor customer service discouraged me..

2. Sound leakage: Another downside is that when I crank up the volume, people around me can hear what I'm listening to through my headphones, which can be a bit embarrassing in public spaces.

Now, let's talk about the positive aspects:

‚òÜGood Qualities‚òÜ
1. Impressive Battery Life: Charging these headphones for just one hour lasts me almost an entire week, which is incredibly convenient.

2. Excellent Sound Quality: At the recommended volume levels, the sound quality is fantastic, providing a rich and immersive listening experience.

3. Noise Isolation: These headphones do an excellent job of isolating external noise, making it possible for me to enjoy my music even in crowded places like Mumbai local trains.

4. Stylish Design: I must say these headphones look good. They have a sleek and modern design that complements my style.

5. Comfortable Fit: They are quite comfortable to wear for extended periods, which is perfect for long commutes or extended listening sessions.

6. Easy Controls: The buttons on these headphones are well-placed and easy to access, allowing me to control playback and adjust the volume without needing to touch my phone.

In summary, my headphone experience has been a mixed. While they have some drawbacks, such as the defective right side and sound leakage at high volumes, the positive aspects like long battery life, excellent sound quality, and comfort make them a decent choice for daily use.

I would recommend these headphones, especially for students. They offer excellent comfort, making them suitable for attending 6-7 hour long online lectures or studying online for extended periods. Additionally, they are quite durable, which makes them a good choice for working professionals. However, if you encounter a defective unit like I did, consider getting it replaced. It's also essential to be aware that the ""Noise"" company is known for its poor customer service, so keep that in mind before making a purchase decision.; Very nice product build quality very good and mat finished gaming latency very good played bgmi with no lag. Mic quality nice. Value for maney product very cheap withs loads of features. Song quality very basy and clear. Foldable feature very good for portabilty.; 1. Sound quality is good.
2. Bass quality is also good.
3. Battery backup is superb.
4. Charging is also fast (not too fast but yeah, fast) and type-C port is a good addition.
5. Buttons are tactile and good so you won't have any problems with that.
6. Matte finish on the surface feels premium but it gets fingerprint smudges so try to keep it clean.
7. SD-card slot and aux support is appreciable.
8. Not durable because it is completely built with plastic, a little amount of metal is used at sides (under elongated part) so if you sleep while wearing it, then only God can save it.
9. After sometime, the points from where it collapses/folds gets loosened up, and you won't be able to jog while wearing it because of its loose fitting.
10. It is a good option at Rs. 1500, if its priced higher then look for other options."

1. Really long battery life - one charge would last me a week of regular use.
2. Sturdy build - I move around pretty roughly and the never saw the wires tearing anywhere even after 2 years
3. Decent sound - I am not an audiophile. Don't know much about trebble, bass, highs, lows. The sound was good.

Cons:
1. Once the battery percentage is below 20, you can't listen to music as it keeps shouting ""Oops! Battery low"" every five seconds. This was the most irritating part and kept me wondering why it is even there.
2. It picks a lot of noise while calling if you are in a slightly busy space like office, or road. So not meant for calling
3. The rubber grip that helps to hold it in place came out easily as it would rub against my bag. Since then, I couldn't use it properly as the earphones would fall off.; This is product is very impressive with many fuctions like sound quality and it's durability of battery power. Service is also nice to reach to the customer. At this range they value for your money. Also light weighted product to feel comfortable.; Overall bass and treble balance is good, and music is good. Battery life is excellent, Icharge it once every two weeks. What I don't like is that the right side is heavier than the left side for the additional control switch present, which add to weight. Except this, its a very good product.; Just received the product. Yet to use for some time before I can give a detailed review. At the outset, product seems good. But I was very put off by the poor quality of the USB-C Cable. It does not work. Tried calling Amazon to report this, but only got automated messages with a promise to call back in one minute which did not happen! I hope to receive a replacement USB-C Cable of better quality which works well. This is a small accessory but the poor quality is tarnishing the name of a good brand like BoAT. Very sad!; I am posting this review after i am using ut for 1 month, see everything is good sound, battery, noise cancellation.
But the most worst thing is those 2 hook like structure which makes your earbud fix to you ear sp it won't fall but after 30 min u will feel pain in the where it stucks, and after like 1 hrs it gets worse. So main. Problem is those little outbreak on earpiece.
Rest is good in this price I don't see any change in sound after changing the mode. But everything is balanced.
If you are talking about calling experience it is good not best but good.; 1. The Product Was Good,Without Any Damage.
2. The Earphones Battery Was Insane, Nearly 2Weeks Without Charge.
3. The Earphones Has Good Durability,Water Resistance.
4. The Price Was Really Ok,Good.
5. The BeastXp Mode Was Really Nice,Noise Cancellation Was Good,Low Latency Was Ok.; Durability - The only negative point and the biggest issue is the durability. I bought this neckband in Nov 2023 and in 6 months, one of the ears has stopped working. This is the standard issue of all Boat earphones.
Sound quality - Great sound quality. I can easily differentiate between the different layers of music. Audio is also clear. Never had an issue with hearing. Even the microphone is good.
Battery life - Great battery life! I have charged the band only a few times. Even after using 4-5 hours every day, I didn't need to recharge the battery for the whole week.; Nothing spectacular but will get you through the day. Sound quality is average no noise cancellation but that can go by without noticing . Durability is surely a plus one. Light weight . No complains so far."

You might be as pleasantly surprised as I was!; I didn't like the way it was packed. Sloppy way torn box wrap and bent inner headphones cover.

Well my review on this Zebronics headphones. Talking of build quality looks ok but a bit on the softer side it could show up damages as one uses it
Testing the output
I checked all parameters like the bass, treble,mid range sound highs and lows.
1.Bass check. I played Nothing else matters by Metallica. I was surprised it did sound great. The bass was good the lead guitar great drummer excellent,bass guitar perfect and rhythm guitar great.
2. Played Abba. ""Volez Vous"" Impressed again great output. The bass was fine, singing great too.
I will update my review after further testing this headphones.
Comfort factor
Not that good i would say. The ears do get caught up and one cannot wear the head set for a long time.
Noise cancellation.
Not really that effective.
It's a good headset to listen to your music. I haven't tested the calling feature which requires the inbuilt mic. Cable length just fine. It's a simple headset at a good price too. Though one cannot expect more juice out of it as compared to high end ones
One shot. Good for it.; One of the worst headset I have ever buy in 1 months it work fine but after that 1 month the mics was not working the noise was not coming good do Liberty is not good it is the one of the first headphone I have ever seen in my life I put not recommend anybody to buy this headset this is a one of the bus headset in my entire life and I am not going to buy Zebronics product again and when it is not working fine I try to claim warranty but there was no warranty; Very sleek and apt product, value for money and clear sound quality.; Sound quality is good and base is good. But cannot wear for more than 1 hour as it starts to cause pain in ear due to incorrect size. The speaker size is small for most ear sizes and so it does not fit properly causing discomfort.; The quality of the sound is good; The head phones have great bass and is very durable and good quality but it's is not comfortable for more than 15 mins the earmuffs are smaller than you expect.; Audio quality is okay.. but wire quality is not good.."

The only problem I feel is the top is too bright so there's no flat sound response and also the mids are not consist. It is boosted in low end and top end while cutting it in the mids but there should be no issue if you use a calibration software like sonarworks.; Loved these headphones.

Beyerdynamics is a smart innovator and knows how to satisfy their customers with their crystal clear & dynamic sound.

Great Bass , Mids and Highs.

It's a bit bulky to put on but it's what you'd expect from a production headphone. üéß

DT-990 is a classical piece of pristine architecture.

Worth absolutely every buck.; Build material is good ....wire is coiled and quality of wire is decent. Very comfortable and seems disappear on ears after few minutes.

Sound quality
Bass ... very nice respone in bass .... can hear proper texture of bass.....not warm and not so rigid...... specially it can respond good in low bass arround 40hz bit down in 20hz mark need equalization and above 40hz mark its good and responsive.

Mids...... are refined can hear every detail of each part and can pin point the imperfections.....clarity in mids is good not as great as hd 650 and hd 660s.

Highs ....... can say good but bit a catch.....it has spike arround 8khz and 13khz and can be equalize.

Overall sound quality in compare to HD 650 is good where 650 lacks in bass a bit it has good respone in bass and good mids and decent highs.(highs are bit high but cleared not hurting ears)
Overall has neutral sound near to flat.

Under 15k these are best open back headphones for mixing and mastering and more than value for money spend on it.......just go for it no second thoughts i say......; * The DT 900 Pro is immediately more 'fun' to listen to than the HD 560S for music. They are not geared toward an analytical listening experience, in comparison.
* Upper mids are less forward than the HD 560S, which is a detriment for comp gaming, but better for musicality depending on taste.
* Bass is beefier than the HD 560S, which is great for experiential gaming and music.
* The soundstage is narrower compared to the HD 560S. You know you're wearing headphones with these cans; the enclosures aren't as open, thus less 'airy', and are a touch veiled in comparison to the HD 560S.
* They're heavier than the ultra-light HD 560s, but the clamp and plush pads mitigate that. It doesn't really feel much heavier. The plush pads are particularly comfy, but I prefer over-ear nature of the HD 560S compared to the on-ear of 900 Pro.
* I had a particularly hard time playing Warzone 2.0 with these. Certain weapon gunfire frequencies shredded my ears compared to the HD 560S, which is because of the sharp 6kHz peak that the 900 Pro exhibit, which climbs rapidly from a comparatively recessed midrange. Not pleasant.
* Furthermore, the added bass and 'stuffier' presentation overall just wasn't ideal for keeping player locations coherent, unless I applied EQ.

My conclusion won't be a surprise: the DT 900 Pro are going back. They are admittedly more fun for music, but the less-open nature, extra bass, and treble spikes, are sub-optimal for competitive gaming. Plus, personally, I love the flat, analytical presentation of the HD 560S for music, so I'm happy to hand back the fun.; bought about 1 1/2 years ago

Listening to Music und Concert-Videos (DVDs and own recordings).
Editing Audio-Recordings to improve the sound - also old rare Live-Recordings from private Concerts etc.

The open Headphone DT 990 PRO 250Ohm ist best for listening of high quality recordings.
Meanwhile I also purchased the DT 770 Pro 80 Ohm - a closed Headphone. Great in a different way. -Stronger bass but just right, not to much. - For certain recordings (including older, mono or semi-pro recordings) it is the best neutral sound for editing and also just listening.; Got this beast today. I'm playing Hi-res 24bit 96kHz music for 3 hours and the sound quality is exceptional. I am now able to hear the details and subtle background sounds which were not audible in my previous Samsung earphone.
Initially I was skeptical that my phone (Samsung galaxy s10 lite) and laptop (Asus K55vm) were not able to drive this 250 ohm headphones, I was even planning to buy a portable amp (topping nx3s) but it's getting very loud with my laptop and my phone is also able to drive this (though I had to turn the volume to full üòÖ). My sister's realme 5 pro is also able to drive this.
While watching infinity war with 5.1 channel audio, the details is so soothing. The nanotech suit transformation sound is totally different from what I had heard from laptop speakers.
I will update this review after burning it for 3 to 4 days and trying every type of music.
*UPDATE after 2 months *
It sounds exceptionally good when playing classical music and songs with more vocals. Bass is not that pronounced so bass listeners, don't buy this.
Sound leakage is a problem when you are in a room with people, at normal (low) volume you can hear their voices and at loud volume they can hear what you are listening.
Soundstage is very good. You can feel this while watching horror movies with 5.1 audio.
Sometimes after using it for more than an hour, I feel pressure in any one of my ear. Sometimes I feel headaches too. It happens around 10% times when I listen to this.; I was afraid before purchasing it. But I can tell now it‚Äôs one of the best headphones in this range !!!; SUMMARY:

I spent quite some time picking out my next headphone upgrade, and I am glad I chose these. While the impedance is quite high and will require an amp, It is well worth it. The quality sounds wonderful, I can hear so much detail now that I couldn't ever before. The low ends sound wonderful through these headphones, entirely due to the open-back design. Unfortunately, that same open-back design can lead to sound bleeding into and out of the headphones. If you are in a loud environment, it will dampen your enjoyment of these headphones. But otherwise, these are a fantastic choice for quality feeling and sounding headphones.

SPECIFIC USE CASES:

I used these headphones for a variety of things, as I do a variety of things. The uses I assume most people are curious about are Gaming, Music Production/Listening, and Movies/TV/Videos. These headphones are perfect for any sort of music production or listening experience. The frequencies haven't been boosted or lowered on any end, allowing you to experience the music as it was meant to be experienced. You can truly hear details you might never have heard before in your songs, I still find new details in the music I listen to!

As for gaming use, these headphones can be quite good, but may not necessarily be what you want. The sound stage and level of detail are incredibly helpful for more competitive games that require the listening of footsteps or far-away noises. If you aren't playing something competitive, I wouldn't suggest these, unless of course, you want that detail.

For movies, and all other forms of video, these headphones are pretty killer. While personally, I believe a nice surround system is better for watching a video, these get somewhat close. What I like about speakers is that they play the sound into the room, while on-ear headphones play the sound in your ear. Having the sound play in your ear can feel less authentic, while speakers can really immerse you into the video. But, that only goes for on-ear closed-back headphones. These headphones are neither. They are over-ear and open-backs. The over-ear helps remove that feeling of the sound playing in your ear, and more like it's playing around it. In addition to that, the open-back design helps the sound escape and gives it a more speaker-like quality of it playing in the room.; Sem sombra de d√∫vidas, o melhor fones que eu j√° tive, som de alt√≠ssima qualidade e o conforto? sem palavras! absurdamente incr√≠vel!; Cela fait des mois que j'utilise ce casque et qu'il est douuux.
Les coussins sont en velours et sont tr√®s agr√©ables √† porter.
Le c√¢ble est tr√®s long, je peux me balader assez loin avec.
Je ne suis pas sp√©cialis√© en audio mais pour un utilisateur plut√¥t lambda le son n'est pas d√©sagr√©able.; La verdad que no salen tan caros y me gustaron mucho, se escucha como si estuvieras escuchando desde unos parlantes, a lo que voy es que con los auriculares puestos parece que estas en un espacio sin auriculares y eso me encanta, para escuchar musica es hermoso escuchas todos los sonidos. Yo lo uso para el gaming y la verdad a comparaci√≥n de auriculares gamer, recomiendo mucho mas estos, a pesar de que no tenga subida y bajada de volumen la calidad lo compensa.

El cable es bueno pero necesitas tener algun conector cerca, sea un micr√≥fono o un toma de jack cerca para que no se estire demasiado. El Jack es de oro y te trae un plug de oro igual, sencillo de sacar y poner cuando quieras.

La comodidad es tremenda, en terciopelo que tiene la hace re suavecita y comoda a la cabeza, ni sentis que los tenes puesto y yo los he usado 5 o 6 horas seguidas, tampoco te fatiga el odio si agarras los abiertos, al principio es un poco duro el auricular pero despu√©s se acomoda a tu cabeza.

Lo unico malo que vivi yo y no se si es normal, es que yo necesito un volumen muy alto, es medio bajo (para mi) el volumen original y tuve que usar un programa que suba el volumen de la pc. Lo que si debo tomar en cuenta es que aunque este bajo se escucha todo, no te saca sonidos el volumen.

Es plug and play. No necesitas acomodar nada.; Personaly i got some hearing problemens above 8k freq. but that reasonable normal for my age and please take that in mind. I also have a Sennheiser 599HD and compared with the DT 990 Pro there is not much of a difference. The DT 990 on it's max formfactor size fits my head perfectly but then it's on its max form. the Sennheiser 599 has more capabilities to fit a larger head more comfortable. The DT 990 has a strong fit which may effect the feelings on your head depending the hours but with both i can sit comfortable for more then 6 hours without any pain. The DT 990 does have a better mechanicle noise canceling, meaning it's stopping the outside noices due it's speakers casing."

I bought 2 pieces of it ....; Whenever I buy something online I spend a lot of time researching the pros and cons of the product. Before buying Noise Three I compared it with almost every other product in the price range of 2000 and it was looking promising. The only problem is the Auxiliary mode which doesn't seem to work properly in my case. The 3.5 mm cables are not working properly as only the left side produces audio but distortedly. Even though the headset provides a jack for 4mm drivers Noise decided to ship 3.5mm drivers instead -- what a shame! Some notable points:
- The cushions are soft. I have big ears and surprisingly it fits my ears completely :)
- It doesn't give room for people with a turban or a scarf on their head. It is a little restrictive in terms of being wide.
- Your ears will sweat if you wear it for as little as 1 hour.
- The plastic quality looks durable and has a smooth matt finish too.
- The buttons have a nice light click to them.
- It looks and feels premium at this price range.
- The mic audio for calling is not very clear. IT WORKS FINE though
- The Bluetooth range is decent too; Good quality,good bass, good sound quality
One of the most remarkable features battery backup overall nice product; The cushion quality is ok.not too good.
Sound is good
Looks is decent
Features and specifications are awesome; Overall sound quality is gud has a base enriched sound but has some serious connectivity issue like keeps disconnecting, I've exchanged the device previous one gets disconnected and turned off but this one just sometimes or manytimes keeps disconnecting if u r oky with this then go for it.; Amazing battery backup ... the quality of this headphones is bang on. I already have JBL 760 headphones worth 7k and I would say this product is a dupe of it. It totally worth buying.; Connectivity best
Light weight, easy to wear and carry
Noise cancellation better but not the best
Build quality greatest
appearance.... Nice good looking for budget headphone...... Easy to attend online classes for students
Sound quality is up to the mark..... Bass is loud as I am bass lover It is killer headphone for me....
Vocals and treble is better......

Noise cancellation is not good; I bought 3 of these and gifted them to my family members. These are simple to use, all controls are on the buds, very intuitive controls, great battery life, very good passive noise cancellation and sound quite impressive. For the price there is nothing as good as these.; These are okay. This can only be used for listening not calling. The sound quality is good. Bass levels are better than competition. Not good for calls as these do not have Noise Cancellation and so all environment sounds can be heard by the person on the other side of the call. And somehow it's very irritating.; UPDATE: these went through a complete wash cycle in our washing machine AND survived completely, both ear buds and the charging case. Absolutely unscathed.

Updating review from 4 to 5 stars. Amazing.

Sound is very clear, bass is on the lower side.
Microphone is great compared to even much more expensive brands.

Only downside is that the charging cable is built into the case and is very short.

Have bought two sets.; Sound quality and Battery life is fine. Works fine with Phone's Bluetooth, but keeps disconnecting when connected to a Smart TV's bluetooth.; Very useful; No son los mejores del mundo, pero si son los mejores por 20usd o menos, no vas a encontrar unos con el balance calidad precio como estos, calidad de materiales, bater√≠a duradera y buena calidad de sonido por muy poco dinero; I got these after losing 2 more expensive pairs, and I love them so much more than those. They fit my ears perfectly, the set up/controls work easily and consistently; sound is clean and clear, full of depth and bass. Charging is fast and the charger is connected to the case directly, battery lasts a long time. I love that I could get them in light purple and the cost can't be beat!

The only thing I wish these had was a ""live"" setting so you could hear around you --like to respond to a cashier when they ask a question, without having to remove your earbud.

I've purchased wired headphones from jlabs before and been really happy. They were for gym/exercise use and was happy with battery life, sound, easy of use, comfort, price, longevity.

Pro tip: if you register your buds you can get a pair of free foam replacement/alternative ear bud tips, if you prefer those to the rubbery ones they come with. Read the little insert that comes with the buds for more info!; So far, I'm really liking these ear buds. 6 months ago I bought almost identical looking Soundcore earbuds for nearly double the amount, but then suddenly one earbud was only outputting half the volume. I figured it was a fluke and repurchased a new pair, but around the same length of usage, it happened again... half volume out of one earbud. So I decided not to replace them again with Soundcore and found these ones. I could tell the design was very similar so I went for it. These are a lot nicer than Soundcore and for a better price. The volume is great, the controls are easy to use, and the battery must be alien technology as I set these down one afternoon, totally forgot about them, and found them again 2 days later outside the charging case, and they still had 100% battery life. I wear these all the time at work, then for an hour walk after work, and have only had to recharge the case once in 2 weeks.

So I had with 0 expectations reading the reviews I got it for a good price at 2800 so i just went for it.
At first when I got the headphones I was dissapointed when I heard coz I put max volume on my phone nd the bass nd sound was low BUT THATS THE MISTAKE I THINK MOST PPL PUTTING THE REVIEWS COZ THATS DEFAULT SOUND which is very low
You will have to put a song or play video it won't work otherwise AND THEN MANUALLY INCREASE THE SOUND BY CLICKING THE VOLUME BUTTONS ON THE HEADPHONES TILL U HERE A SOUND TICK SOUND WHICH MEANS IT REACHED MAX VOLUME.
I did not know this I just found it and UFF the sound and bass increased SIGNIFICANLTY.
SO REMEMBER TO DO THIS THIS WHEN U BUY THE HEADPHONES
After doing that And you still want even more bass and sound then idk do you want ur head to explode or somethin coz it has VERY LOUD AND GOOD SOUND AND BASS!!
OH Yes it's comfortable too not for too long but enough time life 5 or 6 hrs IF u have big ears it might hurt after sometime but for me it's PERFECT.; I have been using the headphones (TUNE 760) for more than a month, here is my review

At first (2 days of purchasing) I was very disappointed because I felt that the sound quality was very lacking, the base and loudness disappointed me, but after a week, it started to sound very very good, I think it needed a burn period, because this headphone is now sounding very very good for me.

Build Quality - the build quality is good, no major issues, the pad is soft.

Comfort - the headphone is comfortable, but one issue is that the clamping force is a bit tight, maybe because I have a big head. Another thing is, even though this is an over read headphone it is not that big, so some part of my ear gets a bit uncomfortable after long use, but if u adjust and find the correct comfortable position, you cab wear it for a long time, I watched a 3 hr movie without any issues

Battery - omg, one of the best part of this headphone, claims 50 hr without noise cancellation, I think it lives upto the mark. You don't have to worry about battery

Sound quality - I'm not an audiophile, let me clear it up. The sound quality I felt was really good and I was very impressed, after the burn in period, so if you are buying this give it at least 1 week before judging it, trust me it really really gets better. The base was not that high, but not lacking also, was upto the mark.

Noise cancellation - it wasn't really that great, could slightly reduce the fan noise that's it, I wouldn't say it is useless, but not that bad either, could reduce the noise of tv from next room when I listened to music, so it did came in handy also with noise cancellation the sound quality I felt improved a bit.

Conclusion - as I said, I was really disappointed at first with the purchase, thought I wasted the money(6.5k) but now I'm really really enjoyed it, watching movies was the best experience with dolby music profile in my phone. I'd say it is really worth the money if ur looking for a headphone around 7k; Pros: good sturdy build and good connectivity and battery life, and aesthetically looks good on you. Active Noise Cancelling is great too.

Cons (likely):

* Charging port doesn't allow for using while charging. I had this in my last headphones (non-brand, cheaper!) and it's so convenient that you miss it and curse whoever is lacking behind in this basic feature. But the good battery backup leaves you plenty time to recharge.

* Too tight. Again, a basic feature IMO to make it feather light which again, a lot of cheaper non-brand headphones are offering, such a shame to see it lacking too. Ears will get hot even in winter/AC. But great if you're a runner, they won't come off.

* Multipoint connection is better than others as it allows you to fully switch between two devices rather divide the audio between calling and music mode. BUT again, the only downside (that maybe only I'm seeing on my Windows PC) that when I switch away from it to my phone, my pc gets entirely disconnected (unlike Android that puts the connection on standby) and I have to re-connect from windows after switching back to it.

* Very little bass. And I feel like ANC might me filtering some of it out, especially at large volume, as the most bass I get at is weirdly at ~80% volume.

Verdict: Well budgeted ANC headphones with lots of good features.; battery and durability -amazing,
sound quality and comfort -great,
noise cancellation -okayish,
mic quality -absolute trash.

all the other reviews speak about the sound quality. it's great in that aspect. nothing special to comment about

These headphones are super tough and last a long time, which is awesome. One thing though, you can't use them while charging, like the Apple mouse. But hey, they charge crazy fast ‚Äì 30-40% in a few minutes, and fully in just 1.5 hours. So, even though you can't use them while charging, you'll be back to wireless mode pretty quickly.

the headphones seem to not have enough processing power to provide good mic quality alongside good sound quality. and when you turn on noise cancelling the mic quality gets even worse. I can't attend calls when im outside, the mic pics up too much noise.

They boot up in noise-canceling mode, which can be useful but drains the battery unnecessarily when not needed. Additionally, they don't automatically power down if noise-cancelling remains active, leading to overnight battery depletion.; Item is good but bass is not as per jbl quality. Further, ear comfort is less. Thank you; These headphones have saved me with the outside disturbance. I purchased it because of Noise cancellation and easy usage. Headphones look classy and the sound quality is amazing. It has both Bluetooth and wired connectivity which comes in handy. Buttons are very helpful to switch from non-NC to NC and even change to next or previous collection. Mic quality works without any disturbance..

Overall, the Duke headphones are a great option for those seeking affordable, high-quality wireless headphones.; The best thing about this headphone is it give over the ear feature in 1299/- and its really confortable and also the bass is unexpectedly GOOD. And for audio volume level, It gives hearable sound in just 18% of computer audio and when i increase audio upto 100 i can hear even the base from 40cm far from the headphones.
As for comfort The cushions are really good, i was able to keep it on ears for 3hrs but not more than that cause it mae my head feel dizzy cause of hearing all my favourate melodies, old school, hip hop, rap and metal songs all at once LOL, But like other headphones i bought this one is stiff and feels like it will break if pressurised to stretch .
As for looks I love the RGB and the grill metal look it gives is DOPE along with plastic matte cover. It is quiet big like having two black and glowing eggs attached to ears but its worth cause the big egg things has lot of BASS inside LOL.
The battery life is incredible, I have been using it since yesterday and it still have 50% battery left.
ONLY PROBLEM is that I found the audio has sharp voice somewhat maximised to keep up with that heavy bass, like when you hear a song you will hear the vocals in sharp voice which is not actually pleasant. I counter this problem by using an equilizer in phone and laptop by decreasing the 14 KHz to some level and increasing 910 Hz to some level. And it only happens in bluetooth mode, The aux is perfect though.
Apart from all this I love my new headphone, Zebronics done a fabulous job by making it and selling it in such an affordable price.; "

‚Ä¢ sound quality is decent, there is ANC (active noise cancellation) which isn't really good, you will be disappointed if you bought it for noice cancellation, it does supress a little external sound but not even remotely impressive

‚Ä¢ It looks beautiful, mine is black, although it doesn't seem very durable, now i am confident i can take great care of it, but if you aren't careful then it might end up breaking within first few months of purchase.

‚Ä¢ Ambient mode is extremely helpful during functions or any event where you need to be attentive, maybe someone is calling you or something else, so using Ambient mode you can hear external sound more clearly

‚Ä¢ One of the main reason i bought it is because of the battery, and it didn't disappoint, absolute monster when it comes to battery, you can use it for 6 hours continuously and only 10%-5% battery will be consumed.

‚Ä¢ It is also extremely comfortable and covers your ears really well, it's foldable but again handle with care, it doesn't seem very durable, modes such as signature sound makes the listening phenomenal.

‚Ä¢ Gaming - now i didn't expect it to perform this well in terms of gaming but i was surprised, while they didn't mention anything about gaming experience, it did perform very well, games checked - (PUBG, Terraria, COD, Dead Cells, Little Nightmare).; I got these for RS. 1500 and let me tell you that for the price they're amazing.

The sound quality is great due to its 50mm drivers, the bass is very loud and you'll be able to feel that thump of the bass.

The reason I keep telling that they're good FOR THE PRICE is that the build quality is not very good, it's made of plastic which is good enough. The hinges and very low quality. My Left hinge broke after around a one and a half year of use.

But if you look at the prize and the things you get it's worth it. I have other expensive hyper x headphones but the bass that the Rockerz 550 give is better than them

It won't last for long but for its price it's really good, if you take extra good care of it I'm sure it'll have a long life.
The thing is even though the left hinge of my rockers 550 has broken the sound quality is still as good as the day I got them.; The built quality is good . It is comfortably and the noise cancellation is next level as it prevents all the background noise. I tried calling on it and it was pretty decent. The vocals were clear. The bass it good . wont suggests for a bass head . The only disappointment was with to vocals. They are crystal clear and sharp but not soft . Like u can consider it is suitable for hiphop songs but wont be that great for classicals. In general its good but ill suggest if ur planing to buy for vocals clearity plz search for better options. This is my persnal opinion.; I got it for 2600 rs and after one month of usage, here's my review
Pros:
1. decent audio, no complaints there
2. Transparancy mode works well
3. Noice cancelation gets rid of the the general noise, but doesn't work well when someone's talking or around constructions or loud noises. Decent for the price I would say.
4. Battery life is amazing. Better than some high end headphones.
5. It's over ear so it's decently comfortable. Ear cups are pretty soft so you can wear it for a couple of hours at a time. Your ears might get a little hot and sweaty after long usage, but it's definitely anything but uncomfortable.

Cons:
1. Durability is a big issue. For so many features at such small price, i guess they cut costs at durability. If you are a rough handler, I would suggest not to get this. One of the earpiece was roasted 180¬∞ about the joint. I had to carefully move it back into its place. It's now loose, though it is my fault, for not taking care, but for this price, the product shouldn't be this non-durable. I've seen cheaper headphones which are much more durable.

Conclusion: if you can take good care of this headphone, do go for it if it's under 3k.
It is truly value for money below 3k. If it's around 3.5k, I would suggest waiting for a price drop.; This is the only overear headphones under 8k but this has the price of 2k that are far better than tws or onear headphones in terms of ear health just go for it I have using it from 1 year any quality issues with this doesn't happen and the sound quality is also good.overear headphones do some passive noise cancellation to cut the external noise.; This product bass quality is not much batter I personally suggest that don‚Äôt buy this product if you are a bass lover or havey sound and the batter is not bad it was surviv up to 9 to 10 days and comfort is also better but squatting in side tha ear after 20 to 40 min and cussen in very soft and her quality is good not bad build quality was also batter the other headphones and one other bad think is that her charging poat is older not c type if the boat company is plat that charging poart the that was a very good think if you are buying as a use for gaming thin you can buy this this is a good product for gaming very low latency this this headphone"

Finally took courage to try my hands on QC45 and XM5. Both had offers running and XM5 had more discount over QC45. I went to near by croma store to compare both units.

Noise cancellation:
Croma had a very big closed indoor space with many people around during festival time, lots of devices playing in the background. Good environment to check the noise cancellation. I liked QC45 among the two. Off/On the NC we can clearly make out the difference.

Comfort:
Easy, relaxed, no irritation on ears, cups sat nicely over my ears with QC45. Cups are made of synthetic though it didn't make a diff for me. XM5 are big pushy on the ears and my ears touched the inside sound drivers literally.

Ergonomics:
You can't go wrong the QC45 cup controls. Works 100% everytime. Thanks to the old gen physical buttons. Otherside xm5 needs time to get used to touch controls. Need trial and error attempts before you master the controls.

Sound:
QC45 audio quality sounds realistic. XM5 comes with more punch and amplified base which I felt heavy on my ears.

App:
Bose app is simple and clear. No nonsense. First time Setup till playback is all guided via app. I have another Sony model XB910N and had experience using their app. They provide 360 audio which is not practical enough. You need to buy those special tracks from other listed apps to experience 360 audio. Sony plays their features to create stickiness for customers. Wat you see on their products is not always yours. You need to keep spending money.

Color and looks:
It's always subjective. QC45 smoke white color is a gold standard. Vintage piece to own.

Marketing strategy:
Sony and Bose are quite opposite in marketing strategy. Sony tends to attract young audiences by sharing the tech used in their products like "" 8 array mic setup to get optimal noise cancellation experience"". Even Bose does the same but they won't advertise their intellectual property information in public for any of their products. That differentiates how well the products reach to new age audience. You will rarely find discounts for Bose products. Sony sales in the last couple of years is heavily into discounts and festive offers.

Alternatives:
Bose 700 has all the bells and whistles to compete with XM5 for an extra money. But QC45 is classic. End of the day we are buying these headphones for the Audio experience and not for complex smart features on it.

I suggest to try the models you like before making purchase decision. Don't go by discounts and brand names. I also followed the reviews on www.rtings.com before making this choice.

Thanks for reading through my purchase experience. Happy shopping and enjoy üôÇüëç; Noise cancellation is really good, battery backup is also good, good build quality, light weight, soft cushioning, everything is so good as well as the price.; Bose is Boss What a product , awesome,very balanced and just about right for fatigue free listening.absolute bang for money; I recently snagged the Bose QC 45 headphones during a fantastic deal on BB Amazon India, and let me tell you, it's been an absolute steal! Bose, a name synonymous with quality, lives up to its reputation with this gem of a product.

Sound Quality:
The audio quality is undoubtedly excellent, though seasoned audiophiles might find it impressive rather than mind-blowing. The sound is bright and crystal clear, with bass that's perfectly audible without being overbearing. If ear-thumping bass isn't your thing, these headphones strike an ideal balance. Perhaps, you‚Äôre looking for ear thumping bass then just go with Sony‚Äôs XM line.

Comfort is King:
In the realm of headphones, comfort is paramount, and the QC 45s take the crown (after Sennheiser PXC 550 ii). They're a breeze to wear, even for extended periods. What's more, they're refreshingly straightforward, opting for reliable physical buttons instead of finicky touch-sensitive controls that can sometimes lead to accidental activations.

Top-Tier Noise Cancellation:
When it comes to noise cancellation, these headphones shine. They excel at creating an immersive audio experience, though I must admit the mic quality leaves a bit to be desired. While not subpar by any means, there's room for improvement. In comparison, it outpaces Sony's XM4 but falls slightly behind Sennheiser's PXC550ii and Momentum 4.

Impressive Battery Life:
The battery life, while not mind-blowing, is certainly commendable. It holds its own alongside Sony's offerings, providing an average user with a solid week of usage on a single charge. Power users can expect a respectable 2-3 days. The added convenience of a quick toggle button for On/Off functionality is a thoughtful touch.

Durable Design:
The build quality is robust, with no noticeable weak links. While earpads may need replacement after a year or two, this is par for the course with most headphones. The advantage of a renowned brand like Bose is that finding replacements online is a breeze.

Travel-Friendly:
The included carry case, though not hard shell, is both stylish and practical. It makes for hassle-free portability, making it an ideal companion for your journeys.

Aesthetically Pleasing:
The design strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and elegance. It's not overly bulky or flashy, offering a low profile when worn. This, in my opinion, sets it apart from competitors like the XM5, Momentum 4, and AirMax.

In conclusion, the Bose QC 45 headphones deliver an unparalleled blend of comfort, clarity, and convenience. While there are other strong contenders in the market, this offering's seamless marriage of quality and reputation makes it a standout choice. For me, it's become the go-to, despite my personal fondness for the Momentum 4. The Bose QC 45s come highly recommended for anyone seeking a superior audio experience, comfortable over ears and has low profile with world class branding!

Alternatives:
Momentum 4 - if sound quality is the only major priority. Perhaps it‚Äôs amazing with battery, features, mic, built quality as well. Only downside I find is it‚Äôs bulky and design.
Sony XM4 - if you want bass and features.
AirMax - If you have apple ecosystem and excess money and most importantly strong neck (they‚Äôre heavy).
Marshall Momentum 2 - If you want to stand out of the crowd, reputable brand, killer looks, enjoyable sound signature (unique), amazing battery and similar price range.
Major downside is with its mic. Else that was my pick!

It totally depends on your needs. Prioritise them and you‚Äôll end up with right cans for you!

Hope this was helpful!; Original headphones delivered, the quality is very nice, I use it for cancelling surrounding roadside noise while sleeping after a hard day at hard work and also use it while I am studying for my exams, the noise cancelling technology is the best in this world, no disturbance and full peace of mind, this product deserves 5 stars; Qualidade incr√≠vel e neutraliza o som ao redor muito bem!!!; Vengo de tener unos beats studio 3 y beats studio pro. Sin duda estos son mejores en c√°lida de audio y comodidad. Los compre al 50% sin duda la mejor compra qu√© he echo. De ahora en adelante solo comprare BOSE. üòÄ; I should say I am writing this review on the basis of just one trip with these wonderful headphones. I left them on the plane and despite reporting it immediately, and two weeks of ""we're looking"" auto-emails/texts, I never saw them again. However, I did give them a good workout during that (international) trip and I found them to be an excellent update to my original set, comfortable, easy to operate and amazing noise cancelation and base notes. I liked them so much I bought another pair (not from amazon) to replace them, but those were lightly used -- still, an excellent set. I love the sound of Bose (I have their soundbar as well) and the headphones, especially the lovely midnight blue, are stylish and swanky.; Tem um som maravilhoso e qualidade excepcional.; I bought these based on a fair amount of research and because of the recommendation of a friend who also let me try them out.
I need active noise cancellation (ANC) to deal with city noises heard indoors when I want to concentrate, and also to share space quietly with others. I also use over-ear phones outside in winter for my energetic-walking music while keeping my ears warm when it's very cold, which earbuds can't do. I find these very comfortable for hours of use, and really effective for ANC. For public transit and walking where I need to be conscious of surroundings for safety purposes, the ""aware"" function does let in a lot of environmental sound but still keeps the music clear.
There are more controls than I probably will regularly use but the basic ones are not too hard to learn and I really like that they are buttons {instead of touch-sensitive, like most earbuds, which are often annoyingly triggered when I wear a hat or hood that rubs on them).
I don't need crazy long battery life (it is already pretty good) so these are consistent with my uses.
The slim profile can easily be worn under a hood in winter or when it's raining and I really like the look compared to my bulky old phones.
The grey colour is also a good neutral option as it looks good on me and helps distinguish my phones from everyone else's black ones.
The case is strong and well-made, which is important for travel."

From the moment I put them on, I was blown away by the impeccable sound quality. The audio is rich, crisp, and delivers powerful bass, making every song a sonic delight. What truly sets these headphones apart is their design ‚Äì they exude a timeless, vintage vibe with that iconic Marshall logo. Not only do they look fantastic, but they're also incredibly comfortable for long listening sessions. The battery life is impressive, ensuring that my music never stops. If you're a music enthusiast looking for both style and substance, the Marshall Major 4 headphones are an absolute winner.; Always a Marshall fan.. Had a Major III earlier... Now a Major IV very nice sound quality.. Happy with the product...; The headphones are good not great. For short calls/meetings, they are fine but when i use it for long meetings ~2 hours, my ear started hurting. Apart from that, the product is good, i am impressed by the battery life though; I have been using these for 3 months and one thing i must say their sound quality is very good and the battery backup is top notch 80 hours continuous use, i usually charge them once a week and use them while working and gaming.
The cushions are very comfortable.
Only thing missing is ANC and other then that they are the best headphones you can get in this price.; Just one word Awesome.,.........punchy sound , overall if you want more natural sound than just .........noise which every headphones give; This headphone looks cool and feels comfortable in wearing too well atleast for tge starting few hours if u find ur size which ur head finds comfort in than it doesnt pain to wear coz it first day i wore it a bit tight on my head thats why i thought its not good but after some time or using i realise its the best headphone for me hehe i font usually like headphones but this one is my fav ^^
Btw i dont find tge sound quality the best but its not bad either but i would have liked the sound more if it was clear and louder.; Amazing sound, cuts off the noise and you can listen to pure music. Awesome battery back up, I have been using it for a month now, not charged yet, still left with 80% charge.
The product does not come with a storage case, so purchased it separately.; I purchased this yesterday on 21 May and received on 22 May. Now the box of the product looks old and used.

It has tears and stickers which were previously removed are still visible.

No one can guarantee if its a genuine product as it does not have an app support functionality unlike Airpods/Google Pixel. Please buy the product from offline stores to ensure you are spending your money wisely.

Called Amazon support and all they kept saying was ‚ÄúWe take your feedback‚Äù but we cant do anything about it.; ; First off, they're super cute and kind of retro looking which is what originally caught my eye! A lot of the reviews said the sound was pretty good but not noise cancelling, but for me it does block out a lot of the noises around me! Once my music is playing, that's all that I can hear which is super amazing! The bass with these are the best I've ever heard even better than Beats in my opinion! The sound quality is very clear especially if you listen to a lot or rock and/or alternative! I can wear these for hours at a time and have no discomfort whatsoever! It helps that they're very easily adjustable too! The battery lasts forever by the way! I went over two weeks without charging them! I do wish that there was a way to check what the battery is at though. It comes with a cord to charge them and a cord to connect them to your phone if you don't want the bluetooth for whatever reason! I highly recommend these for anyone looking for a good durable set of headphones!; I received my order 3 days ago and I have charged it only once - the day it arrived, and it's still working perfectly now. Have been using it whenever I can, at work, in the park, while commuting, etc..
The sound is perfect, i love how it emphasizes the basslines of the music. It doesnt cancel noise as much as other headphones do but it is not a problem. When you are listening to music, you basically dont hear anything from the outside, except during dead/quiet moments of the song.

I love this headphones so much :); After debating whether to get AirPods or these for ages, I opted for these and so glad I did. My partner already has them and says they‚Äôre fantastic so I bought them for myself and wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Marshall is a trusted brand and I knew it would be a quality item. The sound is very good, not ‚Äòtinny‚Äô and has a good mix of bass & treble. Adjustable head strap, not too big for my small ears. Noise reduction as opposed to entire noise cancellation which is good for spatial awareness when out & about. They fold up nicely and fit in most handbags. The charge lasts MONTHS, honestly. Actually stay on my head when I‚Äôm at the gym and I‚Äôm looking forward to using them for travel this summer too. Would really recommend if this is what you‚Äôre looking for; Ljudet √§r mycket bra."

With a USB-C charging port for charging convenience and expanded compatibility.","I recently purchased the Anker Soundcore Q10 headphones for 4k and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed with these as they a fantastic blend of excellent sound quality, comfort, and affordability.

Pros :
1.Sound Quality - 5/5
The Q10 headphones provide an impressive audio experience with outstanding sound quality, delivering sharp highs, full-bodied mids, and impactful bass. Whether I'm enjoying my preferred tunes or immersing myself in a movie, they ensure a balanced and engaging sound. Notably, the bass response adds depth and resonance to my music without overpowering the rest of the audio range. Furthermore, the Soundcore app offers numerous Equalizer and tuning options that make a discernible difference in the sound output.
2. Fit and build quality - 4.5/5
Comfort is a top priority for me, and the Q10i doesn't disappoint. As they are Over the ear , the memory foam ear cups provide a full and comfortable fit, allowing for extended listening sessions without any discomfort. The adjustable headband is also rigid. The overall build quality feels great , the cups did seem wobbly after few but doesnt feel like a weak point . The foldable design adds convenience for storage and portability, making them easy to carry in a bag or case , I already got a case which fits the headphones without any issues : https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B08JTMCSM9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

3.Battery and Connectivity - 5/5
The battery life is impressive as well. I've used them for several hours on a single charge, and they still had plenty of juice left. Additionally , this supports 3.5mm jack so we can plug in them if battery runs out
The Bluetooth connection is smooth, and I haven't encountered any problems with pairing or signal interruptions. The controls on the ear cups are user-friendly and straightforward, enabling swift adjustments to volume, playback, and handling calls.

Con:
1. Mic Quality - 3/5
I'm not impressed with the mic quality. The person on the other end did say that the voice is quite low even though I'm speaking loudly . The issue is more persistent with Bluetooth , while I did not get any negative feedback while using aux cable. Also , this doesn't come with a pair of aux cable which is a bummer.

2. Weight - 3.5/5
Even though the headphones are comfortable , at first usage/ first few mins it feels heavy on the head and neck. Just a nit picking con.

3. Not a big con but there is a lack of active noise cancellation, but considering the price point, it's not a deal-breaker. The passive noise isolation is still effective in reducing ambient noise and works flawlessly, so good that once I keep it on at a mid noise environment , I dont hear outside noise .

The Anker Soundcore Q10 headphones are a value for the price. Providing exceptional sound quality, comfort, and long battery life, these headphones stand as an excellent choice for music lovers and anyone in search of a reliable pair of wireless headphones. I recommend them to those looking for a dependable and budget-friendly audio solution.

Overall I'd rate this 4.5/5; Recived today, good product.
Pros:
good quality product in this range
Sound quality is awesome
Perfect for Movie,songs,calls
Multiple connectivity. Laptop and phone at same time
Low latency for calls and movies and good bass.
Cons:
Donot buy if you have a neck pain issue. As this product is very heavy. After 1 hour use my neck started to ache.
Ear cup material is not breathable , so sweating if you are not in AC room.
Connectivity steps are complicated.
BT/ON/OFF/MULTIPLE CONNECTIVITY all are in same button. Please improve this functionality as it is not friendly for use.

Amazon packing was not that good as the package was litle bit broken.; I agree it is an excellent headphone at given price. However, the volume of headphone does make you feel the price vs product comparison.

Pros:
1. Well built and headphone cover the ears perfectly.
2. Headphone cushions are of good quality. Person in the front can also hear the sound.
3. Voice clarity is immaculate.
4. Does not hurt your ears even at high volume.
Cons:
1. Little heavy built compared to other Hps, however output is really good.
2. At 100% volume you can hear excellent base
3. Wearing head phones for long hours in summer is giving sweat.
4. Cloth materials could have been improvised.; I recently purchased the Anker Over The Ear Headphones, and I must say I'm thoroughly impressed with their performance. These headphones have exceeded my expectations in several key areas, making them a fantastic choice for both music enthusiasts and everyday users.

The first thing that struck me was the exceptional sound quality these headphones deliver. Whether I'm listening to my favorite music, watching movies, or even taking phone calls, the audio is crisp, clear, and immersive. The bass is deep without overpowering, and the mids and highs are well-balanced, allowing me to enjoy every note and detail in my music.

Wearing these headphones for extended periods is a breeze, thanks to their plush ear cushions and adjustable headband. They fit comfortably over my ears without causing any discomfort or fatigue. I can wear them for hours without feeling the need to take a break.

Anker really nailed it with the battery life on these headphones. I was pleasantly surprised by how long they last on a single charge. I've used them for several days without needing to recharge, and that's a huge plus for me.

The headphones have a solid construction and feel durable, but I'd have liked a bit more metal in the build for added sturdiness. However, I've been careful with them, and they seem to be holding up well so far.

Pairing these headphones with my devices is a breeze. They connect quickly, and I haven't experienced any signal dropouts or connectivity issues. The Bluetooth range is also impressive.

While the noise isolation is good, it's not the best I've encountered. It effectively blocks out most ambient noise, but some higher-pitched sounds may still seep through. However, it's not a deal-breaker for me, as it's still quite effective.

In summary, these headphones offer an incredible listening experience, comfort, and impressive battery life. They're an excellent value for the price, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Whether you're a music lover or just looking for a reliable pair of headphones for everyday use, these should be at the top of your list. I highly recommend them!

Pros:
- Outstanding sound quality
- Comfortable for long listening sessions
- Impressive battery life
- Easy and reliable connectivity

Cons:
- Slightly better noise isolation could be desirable
- Build quality, while good, could be more robust
- The headphones are a little loose on my head (maybe because of my small skull size :) ); I've been using the Soundcore Q20 headphones for a few weeks now, and I am thoroughly impressed. These headphones deliver exceptional sound quality and noise cancellation, all at a fraction of the cost of more premium brands.
The sound quality is outstanding, with deep bass and clear mids and highs. Whether I'm listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the audio is consistently crisp and immersive.
The active noise cancellation (ANC) feature works remarkably well, effectively drowning out background noise in a variety of settings. It's perfect for commuting, working in noisy environments, or just enjoying some quiet time.
The headphones are lightweight and very comfortable, even during extended use. The ear cups are well-padded and provide a snug fit without being too tight. The overall design is sleek and modern.
Battery life is another standout feature. I can easily get up to 40 hours of playback on a single charge with ANC off, and around 30 hours with ANC on. Charging is quick and convenient with the included USB-C cable.
Considering the price, the Soundcore Q20 offers incredible value. It competes with much more expensive models in terms of performance and features.
If you're looking for high-quality, budget-friendly noise-cancelling headphones, the Soundcore Q20 is an excellent choice. It delivers superb sound, effective noise cancellation, and great comfort, all at an affordable price point. Highly recommended!

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ; Si bien no soy como otras personas un ""reviewer profesional"" o que me dedique a esto, puedo dar los suguientes puntos en base a mi experiencia personal tantoc o melomano como musico por hobbie.
En mi uso de audifonos tengo algunos en gama y costos similares, como son los JBL LIVE 500, Audio-technica ar3bt, Urbanista Seattle....
Estos Anker mi primera impresion fue, que tenian bastante bajos que ensuciaban el resto de la pista, a diferencia de los otros 3 modelos que mencione eh utilizado... si bien no me desagradaba, estaba considerando la calidad de audio que ofrecen los puse en ultimo lugar de mi lista de gadgets...
PERO O SORPRESA....cuando active el Anc (cancelacion de ruida activa) wwoow.... si bien por si sola la cancelacion pasiva hace muy buen trabajo, esta funcion mejora levemente la eliminacion de ruido ambiental, PERO, tambien cambian las frecuencias la musica que estas escuchando dandele una sensasion de amplitud y claridad a la musica que no tenian en mis anteriores audifonos. Los bajos pasaron a estar en segundo plano, OJO no desaparecen simplemente todo esta en un mejor balance, pero con esto todos los intrumentos escuchando rock, suenan claros estan presentes, mejoro bastante la calidad del sonido y precencia en escenario. En musica electronica tambien tienen una sobresaliente actuacion por sus bajos y potenciador de bajos electronicos que activas con un boton en los audifonos.
CONCLUSION, recomendados!!!! definitivamente Anker es una marca que lo viene hacieno bien ultimamente.
MATERIALES, CONSTRUCCION Y PRESENTACION, si bien la caja y los empacas no son de lo mas eleborado y lujoso, hasta parecieran algo de baja calidad, los audifonos los partes plasticas se ven de muy buena calidad, definitivo parece que soportaran el uso diario y algo de trato rudo pueden soportar si los cargas en tu mochila con mas cosas. Las almohadillas cubren bien tu oreja y te aislan del ruido exterior, son comodas, un poco calientes al ser piel sintetica, pero tolerables.; Tecnicamente, √© um excelente produto com graves bem equilibrados e som bem cristalino. Mas comprei o fone para tentar eliminar o barulho de uma obra vizinha. O Noise Cancelling dele √© muito bom, apesar do quase impercept√≠vel white noise. Deixa um pouco de ru√≠do se usar muito baixo, mas resolveu o problema de barulho externo. Almofadas confort√°veis que cobrem toda a orelha e isso ajuda mais ainda. O acabamento √© bom, nada excepcional, mas cumpre a fun√ß√£o. Comandos externos de f√°cil acesso e a bateria duuuuura longas 40 horas (sem NC). Valeu cada centavo!; These headphone have a great sound frequency range and are very comfortable to wear. The battery lasts a long time between charges even with heavy use. The option of having them wired or Bluetooth is another great thing with these headphone. I also have the Q30s and both are well made. The company is great to deal with if you ever have an issue and go above and beyond to help sort things out l.; Bought these for a friend's birthday and gotta say we were all impressed. It's not the best pair of headphones in the world, but will definitely be fine for normal users looking for NC that benefits the experience. If you want to get in to NC headphones but not break the bank I would definitely recommend these."

- Call quality is excellent plus it cuts off ambient noise while you are talking which is great. So if you are into taking lot of calls then this is the perfect choice as it keeps you focused as well ensures the quality of your voice renders perfectly to the listener on the other side.
- Looks modern and sleek.
- ANC is really good with choice of setting the level unlike QC35ii where there is zero, mid, high with NC700 you can choose individual range for what is low what is mid and high.
- Ear pads are really of great quality and fit perfectly
- Sound quality is balanced renders natural sounds without adding too much of effect but if you like thump then may not be the best one out there.
- Touch controls are really good esp to pause by just double tapping is really neat
- Putting it in the case is pretty easy unlike the foldable qc35ii. I've read reviews where people preferred foldable ones but in my personal preference keeping it in the box is pretty easy compared to qc35ii where you had to figure out which side to fold and then take care while putting it in the box that you have used the padding perfectly.

Cons
- The metal band makes it a little heavy compared to qc35ii and you can feel it during the initial use but will get used to it.
- Butons are very flimsy and don't give the feel as qc35ii controls, they have tried to make them small and sleek but in doing so have made them really to thin and looks to be of cheap quality
- Not much difference in sound quality compared to qc35ii so not a big upgrade if you are planning for.
- Pairing with the app to start using it.; Build quality is very good. Sound is just super, I personally like balnced bass and optimized for all sorts of sounds. It serves that purpose. Yeah, price little high but over all product is good. One thing is, AUX cable they designed like, headphone side 2.5 mm and other side 3.5 mm jack. May be they wanted to use only their accessories :); Immaculate sound quality, great build, fabulous ANC - an all-round winner!; Astounding noise cancellation, beautiful design and poor quality software support.

1. The noise cancellation is unrivalled. A truly worthy competitor in this field. Compare it with the world‚Äôs topmost racing cars in the field of noise cancellation.

2. It looks and feels like a piece of modern art. If you have an eye for sleek design, minimalism and ‚Äúless is more‚Äù thought process, you would appreciate these. Pitch it against any other headphone in the market side by side, and you could see the difference in build quality and design superiority.

3. Software. Bose should fire at least half of its software engineering people. Looks like Bose doesn‚Äôt quiet really know what Quality Software means in 2021. Buggy iOS app, pathetic support site etc. it looks like Bose spent a ton of money in hiring top notch UI/UX designers and cut corners by hiring stupid and cheap app developers. The can‚Äôt be said to be reliable at all. It looks like force fit component in an otherwise beautiful and rock solid product which is worthy of being put at MOMA (Museum of Modern Art). I am guessing Bose relies heavily on third party software developers who don‚Äôt have any idea of what a ‚ÄúBose‚Äù product really means and who the ‚ÄúBose‚Äù people are. In all, software is a huge let down.

4. Innovation and features. The world has made major technological advancements extremely fast and Bose seems still locked in its own research labs and in their ivory towers. Why Bose? Why the attitude? Why are you not adopting the best codecs available out there? Who says you have to clutter your product? Look at Sony and Apple and learn from their best success. Don‚Äôt think that you can remain hidden in your own research labs and can do all the innovation yourself. Because, a day might come, you will be paying a heavy price for this. If you don‚Äôt innovate and compete, you will die.

Summary:
This product would have been an undisputed leader 3 years ago, but not right now. Sorry Bose, others like Sony and Apple have worked very very hard and they deserve the respect and the market a bit more than you for this product.; Awesome noise cancelling headphones ever; It's just been 1 day since I received them and I can't get over how sturdy, compact and beautful these are. Having worn it for more than an hour, I felt no discomfort at all. Its multi-device connection also works well - it's connected simultaneously to my laptop and mobile.; Son unos aud√≠fonos incre√≠bles con una gran cancelaci√≥n de ruido , tambi√©n cubren bien los o√≠dos y son c√≥modos , las personas de cabeza grande no tienen nada que tener , yo los compr√© por qu√© quer√≠a unos que cubrieran el o√≠do completo , fueran c√≥modos y de gran calidad de materiales y estos lo son; Love everything about the headphone/headset.

The bluetooth connectivity is breeze and the sleep/wake up mode is really fast and accurate as it detects the headset being worn.

The only con i have is the battery life lasts for a day and required to be charged. But it is not a deal breaker.

I use this more for Microsoft Teams call or phone call, the audio is crystal clear and the mic is pretty good.

The NC is definitely very good for the cost of the headphones.; These are not perfect as headphones go, but they are literally the nicest noise cancelling headphones that any amount of money can buy. They have their ups and downs. I'm going to talk in depth about each of these, but overall these are the best noise cancelling headphones money can buy, so even when it comes to their downsides, you can't do better.

First, if you're a regular consumer, you'll be blown away by the sound quality. However, if you're an audiophile used to audiophile grade open back headphones like the Sennheiser HD800, these fall short of audiophile levels of sound quality. Let me explain why that is.

Sound quality wise, the sound quality is overall spectacular, but it has two problems. Bass is way overemphasized, and the treble is rolled off. The treble issue is in my opinion the only really major flaw you have to deal with in these headphones. It's really a shame. Even with EQ, there's no good way to make up for the treble problem because the high end is just always a little lacking.

Bass is massively overemphasized, but everyone seems to do that these days, and most people seem to love it. Thankfully, you can just lower the bass in the EQ and it works fine, but from an audiophile perspective it's still a mark against it. You can also raise the bass if you want to lose your hearing and cause brain damage from the thump. These things will thump so hard that it'll give you a concussion.

Aside from those two downsides, instruments sound absolutely spectacular with amazing definition, separation, and clarity, it's just really unfortunate that they rolled off the treble. It'd be nice if the bass wasn't so overemphasized, but the bass at least is understandable since it seems to be what most people want. I will say however that the mid is absolutely spectacular, so there's that.

Even at their best, if you're a real audiophile, these don't hold up to the sound quality of high end audiophile open back headphones by Sennheiser like the HD650 or HD800. These are consumer grade, very top end consumer grade, but they don't reach the heights of real audiophile territory. For most people though, these will blow you away.

Noise cancelling wise, these are the best money can buy. I've tried other noise cancelling headphones, and these destroy everything that I've ever tried. It's a night and day difference in terms of the overall quality and effectiveness of the noise cancelling compared to other noise cancelling headphones.

However, they're not totally perfect. I have a bunch of air filter fans running full blast all the time, and it reduces their volume by 90+%, but it's a little inconsistent. Some of the inconsistency comes from just how the headphones sit in my head, if I get them just right, it mutes probably 98% of the sound, but if they're just a little off, it drops to between 90-95%. Sometimes it just seems to work better than other times with no apparent explanation. 90% is still a ton of noise reduction. Be aware though that you can still hear things, they're just quiet. Like if you pass a fan while walking, you can still hear it, it's just quiet.

There is sometimes a slight amount of pressure from the noise cancellation, but it's very minimal, and a lot of the time there's actually none.

Next, we get into the real premium stuff. You're paying like $400 for this, so let's talk about what you're really paying for: the creature comforts and luxury that get overlooked at lower price ranges...

For example, the case for these headphones is simply amazing. It feels extremely premium, it has a nice touch, it's light but durable, it has this lovely leathery material that is a joy to hold. It just feels like a million bucks. Even the zipper is nice! The internal layout is likewise spacious, protective and just overall very high quality.

Same with the headphones themselves. As an object that you hold in your hand, these things simply feel incredible. They're unbelievably light, I don't know how they made it feel this light. The headband literally feels like a cloud, it almost melts in your hand. I've never felt anything like it. It is insanely soft with this beautiful smooth leather feeling, yet it doesn't collapse when you wear it. I don't even understand how that works, but it does.

These are the most comfortable set of headphones I have ever put on my head by far. It feels like you're wearing a cloud. It's crazy. The clamp force is so low that I can wear these for hours and hours on end and they just feel insanely comfortable the entire time.

Even just holding these headphones physically, they feel like a million bucks. Like they've got these buttery smooth moving collapsible cans, yet they feel solid and durable, and they have this lovely smooth feeling to them.

These are the things you're really paying for when you pay $400. It's just all those little details and luxuries that really make it. They put a lot of luxury into the things outside the actual speakers, and it shows. They feel super premium in your hands, they're a beautiful shape, they're insanely comfortable to wear, they have this elegant simple design to them, and their case is outstanding. Seriously, if you hold the case and headphones of any of the other noise cancelling headphones in your hands, they just don't feel as nice as this.

Overall, I really wish they hadn't rolled off the treble. That's its one major flaw. However, these are so good that I can't go back to anything else (other than my open back audiophile sennheisers for serious listening). These are like the ultimate casual headphones for every day use. Watching TV? Use these. Going on an airplane? Use these. Going to the gym? Use these. Going for a walk? Use these. Unless all you want to do is sit down and seriously listen to some high quality music in a quiet room with audiophile headphones, you should be using these.

These are your ultimate every day use headphones. If you're a normal consumer who doesn't care about audiophile grade stuff, these will absolutely blow your mind. Even if you're an audiophile, you'll probably end up addicted to them for every day normal use. I'm kindof addicted to them myself, to be honest.; Exactly what I‚Äôm expecting from lead brands. Everything is top notch about this headphone.; ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤ÿ© ÿ¨ÿØÿß"

The battery is very good but the charging cable is very short in length.
Built quality is very good feels premium. It's quite smaller than expected and I faced but fitting issue it's quite loose on my head
Connectivity is very fast & Dual Pairing.

Overall I'm satisfied because these days good headphones at affordable range rarely exist. This headphone completes my need of a portable and folding headphone with long lasting battery. The only issue which I found is the sound leakage rest is fine.; I've been using these headphones for a while now. The build quality is excellent and they're definitely not as heavy as some of the other reviews suggest. They're a little tighter around the ears, but that's not a problem for me. It helps with the passive noise cancellation, which is cool. The sound quality is quite good, and listening to music on these is a lot of fun. You can tweak the sound using several equalizers in the app. Keep tweaking until you find what works best for you. These headphones can also be used to consume media other than music, such as videos. The headphones come with Bluetooth 5.0 and AUX support in case you run out of battery. So far, I haven't had any problems with the connection. It's stable and works well when you move around a bit. The battery is the best thing about this product. It easily lasts well over a week on one charge, which is great because I use it every day. So far, I've been really pleased with this product. They're a little pricey, but they're definitely worth it!; The fit is good. Sound quality is outstanding also build quality is premium very comfortable.; These are absolute steal in this price! The design, colour, sound quality and battery life are amazing. The battery life is actually super amazing! I use them for 5 hours straight and the battery doesn't even drop down 1% which is mind boggling. For someone like me who listens to music for long hours, the battery life is a blessing. My head is a little sensitive so it starts hurting though, otherwise I can wear them for 10 hours straight. I got these on 11th May and Today is 18th may. I recieved them at 40% that I have charged them only once till 80% and used them continuosly everyday. I still have that 80% battery left. The colour is beautiful. The sound quality is really nice for the price range. Better than Boat ones for sure! The bass and the treble is perfect. The music feels heavenly at 80% volume. Even though the body is plastic, it feels premium. I was doubtful about this colour due to lack of photos and reviews but I am super glad I went for these, they look classy! Calling is also much better than the boat ones I had earlier. All-in-all, you will not be disappointed after using these.; Fast charging and long-lasting for me cuz I dont use it continuously all day
Sound wise its good
Quality of the product top notch. Came with dust bag,2 types of charges cable and leather quality is sooo goood and soft and it doesn't affect the ears but it will if u gonna use for a long time like any headphone does .
Calls -I dont think its good, the other person can hear you only if there is no distractions like fan and background noises and ull hear all the background noise when ur listening to songs.
So I think there is more options out there for this price so look for other options.; After using completely for 2 days (only removing it for sleep), i can say that sound quality is really good, the sound mixing is good and the overall sound feels dynamic but it causes pain after an hour or two. Then, there is significant sound leakage when the volume is above 80.

i was listening to music, when my parents was sleeping, they literally woke up due to sound leakage from the headphone. To give perspective, when the headphone is listened on max volume, outside people can hear it as sound 20 or 30. This is bad....

So buy this if u want an good looking headphone with good sound output but remember the cons: heavy, can't wear it for long hours, sound leakage

i am thinking of returning it.. to get a over the ear headphones; ; Buenos aud√≠fonos, calidad en el sonido y en el volumen. Por el tipo de aud√≠fono no ofrece un aislamiento completo del ruido pero la esponja hace muy bien su trabajo para camcelqr sobresalientemente el ruido exterior.
Una ventaja es que son Muy ligeros y c√≥modos por lo que puedes usarlos durante mucho tiempo si. Que sean molestos por el peso o que lastimen la cabeza y orejas.

La mayor ventaja que le veo es el aplicaci√≥n que se puede descargar para configurar el tipo ecualuzacion que se desea dependiendo del g√©nero.; The bass boost on these are crazy. They do cinch to your head nicely where they won't fall off so easily like other headphones I've had. They charge pretty fast and the battery life for me last a while because I'm a music fan so I love to listen to music for hours on end. I think it's a good value I wish they were a little bit cheaper but they are definitely a good deal and they do go wherever you go bluetooth availability and it also has an aux cord just in case. I love them. And the color is a plus as well also the cushioning on the ear portion is soft it does get a little sweaty though. Also they are very loud which I love as well and they are noise canceling.; I have been a fan of Anker cords so when I found nd myself looking for a set of headphones, these stood out to me. the reviews were good, the battery life promise kind of hooked me and so I thought I'd give them a shot. I was not disappointed! The sound is amazing compared to ones I have used before. The ear pads are smaller than full coverage so they aren't the best for noise cancelling (but somewhat). They connected very easily and feel nice on my ears. The battery life is amazing. I have charged them in the week or so since I got them but only because of habit (my old ones could barely go a day).
The one problem I have with them is they feel wide and big on my head and I wish I could make the adjustable band a bit smaller to be more snug on my head. I just have a small head so if you have a large one, great, lol!
Anyway, I'm impressed and hope they last me for a long time to come.; Der Klang dieses Kopfh√∂rers ist gut - aber auch nicht mehr. Es fehlt etwas an Klarheit, daf√ºr ist die Lautst√§rke sehr gut und der Bass abartig - und f√ºr mein Empfinden viel zu viel wenn man den Bass-Boost aktiviert. Der Tragekomfort ist ok, wenngleich dieser Kopfh√∂rer schon deutlich auf die Ohren dr√ºckt. Die Bluetooth Verbindung und Reichweite ist tadellos, die Akku-Laufzeit exzellent.
Das Beste aber an dem Kopfh√∂rer ist das wirklich exzellente Preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis: All das um nur EUR 20.- ist nat√ºrlich der Hammer - deswegen trotz der angef√ºhrten Mankos 5 Sterne.; Amazing quality, amazing sound, beautiful clear microphones, lovely bass, unmatched battery life, fits well and easy to setup, as an audiophile who has owned over 20 pairs of headphones, at this price point, they are unmatched, with an amazing free app that syncs your equaliser settings between devices"

Its has got good noise cancelation, RGB lighting, Boom Mic of a very good quality.
Battery is very good, plus a bonus there is a mute button
When playing COD. the best part I felt, that when the enemy was approaching from behind, the headset gave me the exact feeling by making me hear like the footsteps are approaching from behind and back of my head felt it which I found amazing

The only con is the Bass is not that good, its mid level; one word worst to the core, firstly the fit to ear is extremely hard and pushing your ears with constant pressure

Cons :
1) bluetooth connectivity with pc games is useless as it gives reverb sounds while connecting to pc. and cant be played on pc with this pathetic sound. only aux works good. but when connecting aux, the lights, mic everything doesnt work.

2) sound quality is mediocre. the seperation for gaming is poor for pc gaming.

3) for listening to music for long hours is extremely painful and would be ok experience with music as it has music mode.

Pros :
1) only good for mobile gaming but still the fit is issue.
2) bluetooth to mobile works good as it has game mode and low latency.
3) aux can be connected to mobile too.
4) battery life is good.
5) build quality is good but design is pathetic to core.

overall verdict : dont buy at available cost even for 10 bucks also it is useless. as the pain it offers in ears is beyond bearable. features for pc wont work. so useless.

star rating : 0/5

Waste purchase.; Let me talk about the pros first.

-- Build Quality is superb, no one can tell these costed sub Rs 1500, They are better than many Rs 5000 headphone, some headphones stands are more expensive than these.
-- Tight on you head, not too comfortable but not too bad too, the advantage you get is a sound isolation due to the earcup, it is effective, if you are in a call and you are like me who get startled if suddenly your kids start loud music, they will reduce the effect.
-- Dedicated mic, it has a boom mic which has a reasonable surround sound isolation, even if there is loud noise on your side the other call side person will not perceive it as very distracting.
-- For Gamers it looks cool with RGB effects.
-- Mutli-pair options, I have connected it both my home and office laptop and it switch seamlessly, just make it more usable more easily.
-- Sound quality is surprisingly good, I have expensive Sony wx1000xm4, but has they don't have dedicated mic, I purchased this also, sound is good enough that you can use it has your normal music driver, with PC.

Now let's cover cons.

-- The first unit I got gone dead in 2 days, though I got replacement and took the one assist warranty also. Do not buy these without extended warranty, my unit gone bad in 2 days your unit can go bad in few days or may be never, but it is a real risk.
-- They are still tight on your head, prolong wear is going to be issue, for some.
-- Though mic provide sound isolation, but your voice does not sound natural, it is a still recognizable but there is a modulation you will feel, I think for most of the person it is going to be fine.
-- I will still mark them as casual PC headphones (as my PC is not my primary music machine). Its main purpose still remains watching videos and calls, for long music listening sessions I would still prefer my other headphones.
-- As they are big in size they are not very portable headphones, no case is given either."

Go for it without thinking much.; Build quality good, Initially did not like the sound tht much, bt after 1month of use, im enjoying the sound quality , ANC is Ok, bt sound is excellent. Philips app needs to be more customised for Equalizer settings.; Simply best for this price!!! Worthyyy for 7999!!; I was in a dilemma while buying this as it doesn't any perfect reviews while I bought. It was decent. If you are expectations are too high, then this is not your product. Cz, it transmits decent sound, having a longgg battery power. A perfect over ear headphone with less weight and good ANC! Comes with a cool pouch to carry! Great product under this price.; These headphones are pretty decent, it packs a punch, has nice earcups and can connect to 2 bluetooth devices simultaneously. One can go through 4 different profile presets on the philips headphones app and the ANC has 3 levels which are quite nice. Personally i dont use ANC on high as it slowly gives me a migraine so setting to low or off is optimal. Overall i feel theyre quite underrated and dont get given a chance by many users.; The quality is top notch comparable to great headphone over its budget.; noise cancellation is worst. Cost also too much for this product with compare to other products with same features.; Got it for 7500 on sale. The sound quality for the price is great. ANC is decent and comfort is very good. I would definitely recommend this.; J√° tive fones de ouvido desse tipo, jamais esque√ßo da pot√™ncia, conforto e qualidade de som de um fone de da Sony, s√≥ que ele era com fio flat, aquele que n√£o embola e nem d√° n√≥.

While they lack active noise cancellation, the overall performance and features make them a solid choice in their price range. The green color adds a unique touch, though it may not be to everyone's taste. Overall, the Duke headphones are a great option for those seeking affordable, high-quality wireless headphones.; The best thing about this headphone is it give over the ear feature in 1299/- and its really confortable and also the bass is unexpectedly GOOD. And for audio volume level, It gives hearable sound in just 18% of computer audio and when i increase audio upto 100 i can hear even the base from 40cm far from the headphones.
As for comfort The cushions are really good, i was able to keep it on ears for 3hrs but not more than that cause it mae my head feel dizzy cause of hearing all my favourate melodies, old school, hip hop, rap and metal songs all at once LOL, But like other headphones i bought this one is stiff and feels like it will break if pressurised to stretch .
As for looks I love the RGB and the grill metal look it gives is DOPE along with plastic matte cover. It is quiet big like having two black and glowing eggs attached to ears but its worth cause the big egg things has lot of BASS inside LOL.
The battery life is incredible, I have been using it since yesterday and it still have 50% battery left.
ONLY PROBLEM is that I found the audio has sharp voice somewhat maximised to keep up with that heavy bass, like when you hear a song you will hear the vocals in sharp voice which is not actually pleasant. I counter this problem by using an equilizer in phone and laptop by decreasing the 14 KHz to some level and increasing 910 Hz to some level. And it only happens in bluetooth mode, The aux is perfect though.
Apart from all this I love my new headphone, Zebronics done a fabulous job by making it and selling it in such an affordable price.; "

These over-ear headphones deliver immersive sound and comfort, making them a versatile choice for music lovers on the move.; I got this headphones for free with an hp laptop i bought which I lost, ngl it was pretty good, so i ordered the same, and overall it's pretty good for its price
1. The built quality is amazing, all around it's plastic with foam on the headband but it's very sturdy, the headband is not too loose, slightly tight but it does loosen up a bit eventually
2. Comfort - The ear foams are ok/meh but do feel a little uncomfortable after like 2 or 3 hrs, and not much ventilation so It might a get a little hot during the summers
3. Mic - The mic is also pretty good, it does a poor job filtering surrounding noise, you wouldn't be able to hear the noise but it lowers your sound
4. Sound Quality - I'm not an audiphile but the sound is also good, not too high of a bass but it gets pretty loud without bleeding
5. Latency - There isn't much latency or any latency at all that I noticed while daily use, ie on YouTube, media play etc, but there is a significant lag when gaming SO DON'T BUY THIS FOR GAMING
6. Connectivity- Connectivity is also ok but not too great, sometimes the connection does breaks and after 5,6 seconds it reconnects automatically, it doesn't happen too often but it does happen usually after long hours of usage
7. Battery Life - battery Life is pretty good, I can go 3 days without charging with pretty heavy usage, the battery indication (in the app) is a little off though,meaning it might show 100% within 15-20 mins of charging but the battery drains quickly, you gotta let it charge for an additional 20/30 mins after hitting 100% for the battery to actually be full
8. Range- The range is not bad, nothing crazy, around 5 to 6 meters
9. Buttons - 3 okish responsive physical buttons, half to a second delay to pause/play, not much delay for the volume buttons, coulda been more responsive since these are physical buttons but doesn't really matter for the overall experience

Also this is something for Bluetooth headphones in general(not all of them) to note if you're using a 2.4Ghz wifi on an older mid range/ low end Android phone, when you're on an internet call on your phone (doesn't happen with laptops) the call audio quality and connectivity is fine but the wifi speed drops significantly for any other use other than the call because the Bluetooth frequency is also 2.4Ghz and interferes with the wifi, don't quote me on that (found it on the internet); The overpriced headphones were a disappointment from the start. The poor quality was immediately evident, with unpredictable sound performance that was muffled and unreliable. To top it off, the packaging was flimsy and inadequate. A complete waste of money for a product that falls far short of expectations.; Amazing built & sound quality with absolute good price; I have purchased this product with 1199. With this price, I got a nice product. sound quality is good. Battery life is decent. Overall it is good; One thing about these headphones that I don't like is that it disconnects automatically sometimes and the battery doesn't last long as it should. The charging time is also high. Overall looks are great and sound is ok. One more thing that it does not indicate when the battery is low it just turns off without any warning sound. The battery level shown on your mobile screen also has error.; product packing is good but sound and bassi missing yes music come what is point if we pay not get. not happy with the product no retunr policy; One side has broken and the other side is also cracked. I wonder how can HP lend its name such a poor quality construction and poor material.
Frame is all plastic, of low quality. Broken and the headphone is now useless."

I personally tested Bose QC Ultra but disappointed with its sound signature being my aspirational brand since childhood...I am fan of default EQ and already having Wireless Momentum 2 earbuds so opted for this and sound is crystal clear, instruments seperations are excellent, bass is perfect and adequate. It produces dolby suround sound while watching movies feels like theatre exp..buildy quality is top notch..touch and feel is premium...office calls on Microsoft Teams are excellent without any issue despite not present in list of certified headphones...if you have budget for premium headphones then there is no brainer to go with this...You will never regret.; Just recently bought these and they blew my mind straight out of the box! If sound quality is what you're looking for, these are the ones for you! Build quality is another top feature here. They look and feel premium (compared to the Bose QC45, as i own them as well) and are very comfortable to wear. I personally like the touch controls on them because it's tough to press physical buttons always as they might displace the headphones each time you press them. Battery life is a whooping 60 hours (enough said, lol).
ANC is perfect for me as the ones on sony and bose always made my head dizzy. This depends from person to person but i like the ANC on these.
Only good things to say about this product. What a buy, i must say!; Pros:
1) Good sound (a little bass heavy - brand is known for it)
2) Good plastic quality
3) No connectivity issues
4) Touch controls are okay
5) Long battery life

Cons:
1) ANC is average. Not as good as XM5
2) Auto ear detection is a disaster (specially for small ears)
3) A bit uncomfortable if worn for long hours (ears fatigue faster)
4) Heavy
5) Ear cushions cause sweating

Overall, it will be only used to watch movies. For music I‚Äôll use IEM or airpods pro. I got the headphone for around 21k, so it‚Äôs good for the price.

If you like bass and want hi-res sound, then definitely buy this headphone. If you want a balanced sound output, then it is not for you.; Everything about these headphones is premium. From the case, to the accessories, to the product ofc.
Great noise cancellation. Great sound quality and amazing call quality. Microphones work like a charm.
The cushioning is soft and plushy. Touch controls could have been on the left hand side of the headphones too...but that's okay.
One problem, though - I was on a call, and it randomly said Mute On. This happens when you take the headphones off. If you put them back on again the mute will OFF. but I don't know why, in the middle of me speaking, it would decide to go on mute. :/
One of incident, just need to be a little mindful of it's fitting.; Got the Denim special edition.
Sound Quality: Excellent clarity and balanced sound
profile, with deep rumbling bass and detailed highs.
Comfort: Lightweight and
comfortable for long listening sessions, featuring plush ear cushions and an adjustable headband.
Noise Cancellation: Effective active noise cancellation that reduces ambient noise, enhancing the listening experience.
Battery Life: Impressive long-lasting battery, offering up to 60 hours of playtime on a single charge.
Design: Sleek and modern
aesthetic, though some may prefer the retro look of previous models.
‚Ä¢Features: Intuitive touch controls and customizable
sound through the Sennheiser app.
Price: On the higher end, but justified by the quality and features offered.; Im okay with quality of music and everything else but in terms of comfortable it is worst. I should have gone with Bose instead.; Sound quality is on another level compared to competing brand like sony and bose. I have tested QC45, New QC, QC ultras , NC 700 and XM5 , none of these headsets match the quality provided by sennheiser. The bass of these headphones are so good and tight. The base can be felt physically vibrating in the ears ( Not an exaggeration). The personalised eq settings can really make a huge difference based on your preference. The battery life is also out of the league. ANC is not as great as bose or xm5s, but still it is decent. For me personally it was my first time with an ANC headphones so it was good for me. The volume is lacking by little compared to the other ones but it is in no way less than adequate, at max volumes you never feel you want more volume.; I purchased this Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphone on 6th June 2024 after buy Sennheiser Accentum Plus and like its sound quality. I would say this headphone is Best in class of Best sounding headphone in market right now as compared to big brand like Sony & Bose. Yes, volume is very low and ANC is average and not compared with Sony & Bose in ANC performance.
It has been proved Sennheiser is Sennheiser and no other brand match a sound quality with Sennheiser in terms of best sound quality.; I was not a fan of the stylistic refresh from 3 to 4, but after buying a pair a see why they did it. These are very, very comfortable and have quite good anc. The sound may be a little too bassy for some but that is easily fixable with the fantastic app you can download. These have great mids and Treble that extends fairly far but never gets shouty or sibilant. The battery life is mind-blowing with anc, so if you're a traveler, etc. These should probably be your first choice. I love them! I prefer the sound of my Dali io-4, but for comfort and everything else these win by far.; -Sonido
Soy una persona que ama los bajos retumbantes, que te hagan temblar la cabeza pero que lo demas no brille por su ausencia, y wow! Los bajos de estos audifonos son como los de los Sony XM4 o incluso mayores, una bestialidad, en cuanto a medios y altos definitivamente son increibles, la separacion de instrumentos y sonido 10/10 (toma en cuenta que puedes usar un eq de 5 bandas y una opcion con aumento de bajos)

-ANC
He tenido la chance de usar la cancelacion de ruido de los airpods max, sony xm4 y bose qc y qc ultra, sin musica puesta estos audifonos almenos en ambientes no muy ruidosos no son los mejores, pero en cuanto pones musica no escucharas ni una alarma nuclear, tengo que probarlos en mas ambientes aun...

-Bateria
60 horas de bateria, no hay nada mas que decir...

-Comodidad
Las almohadillas acolchan las orejas y la cabeza de una manera agradable, pesaran 50 gramos mas que los xm5 o los qc ultra, pero no se sienten para nada pesados

-Material
Aunque es plastico, se siente bastante premium, el material de la diadema le da un aspecto premium, ademas del logo de sennheiser con un aspecto de plata

-App
Una app muy completa, con control de cancelacion de ruido, equalizador como mencione antes, que permite un cambio automatico dependiendo de el lugar en el que estes, cambio de codec y resolucion de audio (solo AAC en iphone)

-Estuche
Si tiene estuche (no como los Airpods Max) y es de un material solido, contiene cargador bastante largo, cable y un adaptador de avion, en general de un tama√±o bastante bueno, aunque not an peque√±o como los sony xm4 o bose qc y qc ultra

En conclusion, si los agarras en oferta a buen precio, no dudes en comprarlos si buscas unos audifonos premium y de calidad, totalmente satisfecho de la compra de la marca Sennheiser; Desligue o cancelamento de ru√≠do adapt√°vel e o barulho, de repente, invade sues ouvidos. Ligue de novo e um quase completo sil√™ncio vai te envolver.
A qualidade do som √© excelente!
Outro recurso legal √© guardar o fone no caixa e o aparelho desliga sozinho na mesma hora!; Let me say upfront I am a long-time audiophile. I've been immersed in all things high-end audio for more than 40 years, and listened to a lot of stuff, including headphones. Until recently, I've avoided all BT/wireless headphones because they presented too much compromise for my tastes. Noise cancellation adversely effected audio quality and/or gave me a headache. Bluetooth simply didn't cut it for prolonged enjoyment because of the lower, compressed resolution and frequency.

But, that all changed in late 2022. On a whim, I tried the newish Sony WH-1000XM5 and was surprised at how good they sounded. The noise cancellation was excellent with little of the rushing elevator sound--and boy, the sound was terrific. For the first time I felt like using a wireless headphone wasn't a big step-down from wired. The M5's soundstage was truly impressive, rivaling my Focal Clear MG wired 'phones. Plus, the M5s were much lighter, more portable, and a bit more fun. The new Sony's were a magnitude better than the older Sonys, as well as anything wireless I'd heard before.

That got me wondering: If the Sony's are this good, maybe something by Bowers and Wilkins or Sennheiser would be even better. After all, Sony caters to the mass market, which is generally not that discerning when it comes to audio. Whereas, B&W and Sennheiser typically aim more for the smaller, high-end, audiophile market. So, I started comparing the MX5 to the new B&W Px7 S2 and new Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless.

Here's what I found:

In the past, like the Sonys, the B&Ws and Sennheiser wireless 'phones were disappointments, falling far short (for me) of their wired, non-NC counterparts. No longer, because the new models are dramatically better. Without going into lots of detail (something audiophiles love to do), both the Px7 S2 and the Momentum 4 are a leap forward in every way than their predecessors. Are they better than the MX5, yes, but not by much. As others have said, the MX5 has better software, better NC, is very portable, and pretty comfortable. For many, the slight compromise in audio quality may not be a big deal. I could easily live with the MX5. However, my priority is sound quality since I seldom use NC, and, even if the software of the B&Ws and Sennheisers is only acceptable.

Therefore, it came down to the Px7 S2 vs. Momentum 4 for me. The Px7 S2 is much nicer to look at, exuding high quality. The Momentum 4, not so much. In fact, they look like an MX5 knock-off with a few upscale touches. The software of both the Px7 S2 and Momentum 4 is mediocre at best, albeit functional.

Now about the sound. The Px7 S2 sound really, really good. Bass, Midrange, Treble are all top notch, if not perfect. They're fun to listen to, with a wide soundstage and energetic dynamics. That said, they're tuned to emphasize the lower frequencies a bit too much for my tastes. At first, this makes music and voices more vibrant and robust, but, over time, it gets tiring, and you're realize what you're hearing isn't all that accurate. If I hadn't listened to the Momentum 4s, I probably would have been quite happy with the Px7 S2.

But, I did listen to the Momentum 4. It edges out thePx7 S2 and MX5 with its overall excellent balance and accuracy. Nothing is exaggerated: voices, instruments, timbre, tone are all just right to my ears. Maybe not as exciting as the Px7 S2 upon first listen, but the Momentum 4s seduce you the more you use them. There's no need for lots of equalization, or fiddling to get the sound right; its all been done at the factory. Besides the accurate representation of voices and instruments, the Momentum 4s are monsters when it comes to soundstage. The placement of everything is wide, yet accurate. You can feel the space and air between different instruments, and where the singer is in the studio or stage. Layering and detail are pretty amazing considering these are bluetooth, closed-back 'phones. Sennheiser (Actually: Sonova, because Sennheiser sold their headphone division to this maker of hearing aids in 2021.) did their homework when it came to the Momentum 4. Plus, that 60 hours of battery life is icing on the cake.

Let me say this in conclusion. You won't go wrong with any of these three headphones. They're all great. I preferred the Momentum 4 because it represents the overall most satisfying package for the money, but you might prefer the Px7 S2, or the MX5, more. One last word, regarding the buggy software of the Momentum 4: I found none. With the latest updates, Sennheiser/Sonova seems have fixed the issues of poor connectivity and consistency. All system functions worked perfectly the entire time I've been using the Momentum 4s. Enjoy!; Excellente qualit√©, facile d'utilisation, convient pour tout type de musique."

1. Really long battery life - one charge would last me a week of regular use.
2. Sturdy build - I move around pretty roughly and the never saw the wires tearing anywhere even after 2 years
3. Decent sound - I am not an audiophile. Don't know much about trebble, bass, highs, lows. The sound was good.

Cons:
1. Once the battery percentage is below 20, you can't listen to music as it keeps shouting ""Oops! Battery low"" every five seconds. This was the most irritating part and kept me wondering why it is even there.
2. It picks a lot of noise while calling if you are in a slightly busy space like office, or road. So not meant for calling
3. The rubber grip that helps to hold it in place came out easily as it would rub against my bag. Since then, I couldn't use it properly as the earphones would fall off.; This is product is very impressive with many fuctions like sound quality and it's durability of battery power. Service is also nice to reach to the customer. At this range they value for your money. Also light weighted product to feel comfortable.; Overall bass and treble balance is good, and music is good. Battery life is excellent, Icharge it once every two weeks. What I don't like is that the right side is heavier than the left side for the additional control switch present, which add to weight. Except this, its a very good product.; Just received the product. Yet to use for some time before I can give a detailed review. At the outset, product seems good. But I was very put off by the poor quality of the USB-C Cable. It does not work. Tried calling Amazon to report this, but only got automated messages with a promise to call back in one minute which did not happen! I hope to receive a replacement USB-C Cable of better quality which works well. This is a small accessory but the poor quality is tarnishing the name of a good brand like BoAT. Very sad!; I am posting this review after i am using ut for 1 month, see everything is good sound, battery, noise cancellation.
But the most worst thing is those 2 hook like structure which makes your earbud fix to you ear sp it won't fall but after 30 min u will feel pain in the where it stucks, and after like 1 hrs it gets worse. So main. Problem is those little outbreak on earpiece.
Rest is good in this price I don't see any change in sound after changing the mode. But everything is balanced.
If you are talking about calling experience it is good not best but good.; 1. The Product Was Good,Without Any Damage.
2. The Earphones Battery Was Insane, Nearly 2Weeks Without Charge.
3. The Earphones Has Good Durability,Water Resistance.
4. The Price Was Really Ok,Good.
5. The BeastXp Mode Was Really Nice,Noise Cancellation Was Good,Low Latency Was Ok.; Durability - The only negative point and the biggest issue is the durability. I bought this neckband in Nov 2023 and in 6 months, one of the ears has stopped working. This is the standard issue of all Boat earphones.
Sound quality - Great sound quality. I can easily differentiate between the different layers of music. Audio is also clear. Never had an issue with hearing. Even the microphone is good.
Battery life - Great battery life! I have charged the band only a few times. Even after using 4-5 hours every day, I didn't need to recharge the battery for the whole week.; Nothing spectacular but will get you through the day. Sound quality is average no noise cancellation but that can go by without noticing . Durability is surely a plus one. Light weight . No complains so far."

With an impressive 60 hours of playback time, they are perfect for users who need reliable headphones for long listening sessions. While they lack active noise cancellation, the overall performance and features make them a solid choice in their price range. The green color adds a unique touch, though it may not be to everyone's taste. Overall, the Duke headphones are a great option for those seeking affordable, high-quality wireless headphones.; The best thing about this headphone is it give over the ear feature in 1299/- and its really confortable and also the bass is unexpectedly GOOD. And for audio volume level, It gives hearable sound in just 18% of computer audio and when i increase audio upto 100 i can hear even the base from 40cm far from the headphones.
As for comfort The cushions are really good, i was able to keep it on ears for 3hrs but not more than that cause it mae my head feel dizzy cause of hearing all my favourate melodies, old school, hip hop, rap and metal songs all at once LOL, But like other headphones i bought this one is stiff and feels like it will break if pressurised to stretch .
As for looks I love the RGB and the grill metal look it gives is DOPE along with plastic matte cover. It is quiet big like having two black and glowing eggs attached to ears but its worth cause the big egg things has lot of BASS inside LOL.
The battery life is incredible, I have been using it since yesterday and it still have 50% battery left.
ONLY PROBLEM is that I found the audio has sharp voice somewhat maximised to keep up with that heavy bass, like when you hear a song you will hear the vocals in sharp voice which is not actually pleasant. I counter this problem by using an equilizer in phone and laptop by decreasing the 14 KHz to some level and increasing 910 Hz to some level. And it only happens in bluetooth mode, The aux is perfect though.
Apart from all this I love my new headphone, Zebronics done a fabulous job by making it and selling it in such an affordable price.; "

So I had with 0 expectations reading the reviews I got it for a good price at 2800 so i just went for it.
At first when I got the headphones I was dissapointed when I heard coz I put max volume on my phone nd the bass nd sound was low BUT THATS THE MISTAKE I THINK MOST PPL PUTTING THE REVIEWS COZ THATS DEFAULT SOUND which is very low
You will have to put a song or play video it won't work otherwise AND THEN MANUALLY INCREASE THE SOUND BY CLICKING THE VOLUME BUTTONS ON THE HEADPHONES TILL U HERE A SOUND TICK SOUND WHICH MEANS IT REACHED MAX VOLUME.
I did not know this I just found it and UFF the sound and bass increased SIGNIFICANLTY.
SO REMEMBER TO DO THIS THIS WHEN U BUY THE HEADPHONES
After doing that And you still want even more bass and sound then idk do you want ur head to explode or somethin coz it has VERY LOUD AND GOOD SOUND AND BASS!!
OH Yes it's comfortable too not for too long but enough time life 5 or 6 hrs IF u have big ears it might hurt after sometime but for me it's PERFECT.; I have been using the headphones (TUNE 760) for more than a month, here is my review

At first (2 days of purchasing) I was very disappointed because I felt that the sound quality was very lacking, the base and loudness disappointed me, but after a week, it started to sound very very good, I think it needed a burn period, because this headphone is now sounding very very good for me.

Build Quality - the build quality is good, no major issues, the pad is soft.

Comfort - the headphone is comfortable, but one issue is that the clamping force is a bit tight, maybe because I have a big head. Another thing is, even though this is an over read headphone it is not that big, so some part of my ear gets a bit uncomfortable after long use, but if u adjust and find the correct comfortable position, you cab wear it for a long time, I watched a 3 hr movie without any issues

Battery - omg, one of the best part of this headphone, claims 50 hr without noise cancellation, I think it lives upto the mark. You don't have to worry about battery

Sound quality - I'm not an audiophile, let me clear it up. The sound quality I felt was really good and I was very impressed, after the burn in period, so if you are buying this give it at least 1 week before judging it, trust me it really really gets better. The base was not that high, but not lacking also, was upto the mark.

Noise cancellation - it wasn't really that great, could slightly reduce the fan noise that's it, I wouldn't say it is useless, but not that bad either, could reduce the noise of tv from next room when I listened to music, so it did came in handy also with noise cancellation the sound quality I felt improved a bit.

Conclusion - as I said, I was really disappointed at first with the purchase, thought I wasted the money(6.5k) but now I'm really really enjoyed it, watching movies was the best experience with dolby music profile in my phone. I'd say it is really worth the money if ur looking for a headphone around 7k; Pros: good sturdy build and good connectivity and battery life, and aesthetically looks good on you. Active Noise Cancelling is great too.

Cons (likely):

* Charging port doesn't allow for using while charging. I had this in my last headphones (non-brand, cheaper!) and it's so convenient that you miss it and curse whoever is lacking behind in this basic feature. But the good battery backup leaves you plenty time to recharge.

* Too tight. Again, a basic feature IMO to make it feather light which again, a lot of cheaper non-brand headphones are offering, such a shame to see it lacking too. Ears will get hot even in winter/AC. But great if you're a runner, they won't come off.

* Multipoint connection is better than others as it allows you to fully switch between two devices rather divide the audio between calling and music mode. BUT again, the only downside (that maybe only I'm seeing on my Windows PC) that when I switch away from it to my phone, my pc gets entirely disconnected (unlike Android that puts the connection on standby) and I have to re-connect from windows after switching back to it.

* Very little bass. And I feel like ANC might me filtering some of it out, especially at large volume, as the most bass I get at is weirdly at ~80% volume.

Verdict: Well budgeted ANC headphones with lots of good features.; battery and durability -amazing,
sound quality and comfort -great,
noise cancellation -okayish,
mic quality -absolute trash.

all the other reviews speak about the sound quality. it's great in that aspect. nothing special to comment about

These headphones are super tough and last a long time, which is awesome. One thing though, you can't use them while charging, like the Apple mouse. But hey, they charge crazy fast ‚Äì 30-40% in a few minutes, and fully in just 1.5 hours. So, even though you can't use them while charging, you'll be back to wireless mode pretty quickly.

the headphones seem to not have enough processing power to provide good mic quality alongside good sound quality. and when you turn on noise cancelling the mic quality gets even worse. I can't attend calls when im outside, the mic pics up too much noise.

They boot up in noise-canceling mode, which can be useful but drains the battery unnecessarily when not needed. Additionally, they don't automatically power down if noise-cancelling remains active, leading to overnight battery depletion.; Item is good but bass is not as per jbl quality. Further, ear comfort is less. Thank you; These headphones have saved me with the outside disturbance. I purchased it because of Noise cancellation and easy usage. Headphones look classy and the sound quality is amazing. It has both Bluetooth and wired connectivity which comes in handy. Buttons are very helpful to switch from non-NC to NC and even change to next or previous collection. Mic quality works without any disturbance..

With a noise reduction of up to 25dB, these headphones excel in creating a serene listening environment, whether you're on a noisy commute or simply looking for some peace and quiet.

The 40mm drivers deliver excellent sound quality, producing rich and vibrant audio across a wide range of frequencies. Whether you're a fan of bass-heavy tracks or prefer more balanced sound, the BH51 can handle it all. The headphones offer a truly enjoyable audio experience, allowing you to appreciate the nuances and details in your favorite music.

In addition to great sound, these headphones provide a long playtime of up to 32 hours*, ensuring that you can enjoy your music for extended periods without worrying about recharging. The inclusion of TurboVolt fast charging technology is a welcome addition, allowing you to quickly recharge the headphones when you're short on time.

The built-in microphone on the BH51 performs well during voice calls, providing clear and crisp audio transmission. The convenience of having a microphone integrated into the headphones eliminates the need for an external headset when making or receiving calls, making it a practical choice for those who frequently engage in phone conversations.

Overall, the Blaupunkt BH51 ANC Moksha Bluetooth Wireless On Ear Headphones offer an exceptional combination of features, including active noise cancellation, long battery life, excellent sound quality, and a built-in microphone. If you're looking for a versatile and reliable pair of headphones that deliver a premium audio experience, the BH51 is definitely worth considering.; For those of you who are unaware, Blaupunkt is a well-known German audio brand that was cruising in popularity during the 90s in India for their expert tuned audio devices for cars, and home audio. With the ever-increasing growth of China brands and technologies, the last 20 odd years have been devoid of Blaupunkt because they simply could not compete. Now though, it's a little different, Blaupunkt has also bought into the Chinese technologies output, investing in audio-ware that is made in China, and then applied in their own audio-devices. Don't get me wrong, that isn't a bad thing at all. Most companies do that, including Apple. There isn't any downfall in quality either. It's good to see this German outlet, get back into the game, because honestly back then, owning a Blaupunkt car stereo and ‚Äúmusic system‚Äù was an admirable feat.

Coming back to this very product. The headphones are good. They aren't great, but they are good. For its price, the ANC isn't anything to brag about, because you'll mostly not be using it (It's so bad), but then again, you are only paying around 3k, there isn't much you should be expecting in the first place. With a db range of what they claim is 25, this will barely do anything. You'd rather stick to its noise isolation, that it's managed to design decently well.

The build is also quite good. An inner metal frame gives it a boost of sturdiness. The outer plastic seems like it also does the job quite well. The cushion padding is soft, but the overall tightness that you'll experience might be a little unpleasant. It may be a matter of getting used to (like me), or it might not strike your fancy at all.

The navigation button also appears to be average, nothing exceptional there. There's a voice that tells you, the device is on or is being shut off, which, I felt, was a thoroughly cheap move. The audio quality of the voice is so bad, I really don't want to comment on it, you'll have to experience it yourself to understand, but these are the things you usually sacrifice for how much you're paying.

The sound quality, excluding the ANC mode, is where this headphone shines. If you're just looking for something that sounds good, without peering into the rest of its features, you probably won't be too disappointed. This being said, I'll have to add that they're on the bass heavier side, it's pre-equalised, so nothing you play on these, will sound flat.

Overall, again, for its price, I don't think you should complain, although there are several things that you could complain about.

A solid 7/10."

So I had with 0 expectations reading the reviews I got it for a good price at 2800 so i just went for it.
At first when I got the headphones I was dissapointed when I heard coz I put max volume on my phone nd the bass nd sound was low BUT THATS THE MISTAKE I THINK MOST PPL PUTTING THE REVIEWS COZ THATS DEFAULT SOUND which is very low
You will have to put a song or play video it won't work otherwise AND THEN MANUALLY INCREASE THE SOUND BY CLICKING THE VOLUME BUTTONS ON THE HEADPHONES TILL U HERE A SOUND TICK SOUND WHICH MEANS IT REACHED MAX VOLUME.
I did not know this I just found it and UFF the sound and bass increased SIGNIFICANLTY.
SO REMEMBER TO DO THIS THIS WHEN U BUY THE HEADPHONES
After doing that And you still want even more bass and sound then idk do you want ur head to explode or somethin coz it has VERY LOUD AND GOOD SOUND AND BASS!!
OH Yes it's comfortable too not for too long but enough time life 5 or 6 hrs IF u have big ears it might hurt after sometime but for me it's PERFECT.; I have been using the headphones (TUNE 760) for more than a month, here is my review

At first (2 days of purchasing) I was very disappointed because I felt that the sound quality was very lacking, the base and loudness disappointed me, but after a week, it started to sound very very good, I think it needed a burn period, because this headphone is now sounding very very good for me.

Build Quality - the build quality is good, no major issues, the pad is soft.

Comfort - the headphone is comfortable, but one issue is that the clamping force is a bit tight, maybe because I have a big head. Another thing is, even though this is an over read headphone it is not that big, so some part of my ear gets a bit uncomfortable after long use, but if u adjust and find the correct comfortable position, you cab wear it for a long time, I watched a 3 hr movie without any issues

Battery - omg, one of the best part of this headphone, claims 50 hr without noise cancellation, I think it lives upto the mark. You don't have to worry about battery

Sound quality - I'm not an audiophile, let me clear it up. The sound quality I felt was really good and I was very impressed, after the burn in period, so if you are buying this give it at least 1 week before judging it, trust me it really really gets better. The base was not that high, but not lacking also, was upto the mark.

Noise cancellation - it wasn't really that great, could slightly reduce the fan noise that's it, I wouldn't say it is useless, but not that bad either, could reduce the noise of tv from next room when I listened to music, so it did came in handy also with noise cancellation the sound quality I felt improved a bit.

Conclusion - as I said, I was really disappointed at first with the purchase, thought I wasted the money(6.5k) but now I'm really really enjoyed it, watching movies was the best experience with dolby music profile in my phone. I'd say it is really worth the money if ur looking for a headphone around 7k; Pros: good sturdy build and good connectivity and battery life, and aesthetically looks good on you. Active Noise Cancelling is great too.

Cons (likely):

* Charging port doesn't allow for using while charging. I had this in my last headphones (non-brand, cheaper!) and it's so convenient that you miss it and curse whoever is lacking behind in this basic feature. But the good battery backup leaves you plenty time to recharge.

* Too tight. Again, a basic feature IMO to make it feather light which again, a lot of cheaper non-brand headphones are offering, such a shame to see it lacking too. Ears will get hot even in winter/AC. But great if you're a runner, they won't come off.

* Multipoint connection is better than others as it allows you to fully switch between two devices rather divide the audio between calling and music mode. BUT again, the only downside (that maybe only I'm seeing on my Windows PC) that when I switch away from it to my phone, my pc gets entirely disconnected (unlike Android that puts the connection on standby) and I have to re-connect from windows after switching back to it.

* Very little bass. And I feel like ANC might me filtering some of it out, especially at large volume, as the most bass I get at is weirdly at ~80% volume.

Verdict: Well budgeted ANC headphones with lots of good features.; battery and durability -amazing,
sound quality and comfort -great,
noise cancellation -okayish,
mic quality -absolute trash.

all the other reviews speak about the sound quality. it's great in that aspect. nothing special to comment about

These headphones are super tough and last a long time, which is awesome. One thing though, you can't use them while charging, like the Apple mouse. But hey, they charge crazy fast ‚Äì 30-40% in a few minutes, and fully in just 1.5 hours. So, even though you can't use them while charging, you'll be back to wireless mode pretty quickly.

the headphones seem to not have enough processing power to provide good mic quality alongside good sound quality. and when you turn on noise cancelling the mic quality gets even worse. I can't attend calls when im outside, the mic pics up too much noise.

They boot up in noise-canceling mode, which can be useful but drains the battery unnecessarily when not needed. Additionally, they don't automatically power down if noise-cancelling remains active, leading to overnight battery depletion.; Item is good but bass is not as per jbl quality. Further, ear comfort is less. Thank you; These headphones have saved me with the outside disturbance. I purchased it because of Noise cancellation and easy usage. Headphones look classy and the sound quality is amazing. It has both Bluetooth and wired connectivity which comes in handy. Buttons are very helpful to switch from non-NC to NC and even change to next or previous collection. Mic quality works without any disturbance.. Warranty is provided and value for the price range.; A bateria dura muito para carregar ela t√° amando,

Pairing the headphones with your mobile/laptop is quite easy. The look and feel is good, fabric of the headphone cushions (they can be washed as well) is good material, overall quite happy with the purchase. Sound quality is okay, noise cancellation is optimum for zoom meetings and calls. The only negative (3 stars) is for the heaviness, wearing it for more than 15 minutes feels like it is weighing on your head. The size fits a medium head comfortably, but would feel extremely tight for people with bigger heads or even larger ears.; I really love this product. I brought this product because of fabricated earnings cups. Which is durable and very comfortable. The sound quality is also good. Changing and battery life is amazing.; Nice product. Good quality. But microphone is not much effective. So as a headphone it's quality is superb but not good for conversations.; Very average sound quality. The sound seems muffled and does not feel wide. Bass is good enough. Mids are so-so. Highs are decent. Only good thing is that it is IP55 rated so good for workouts. Might not be good for running but it is fits tight enough for bodybuilding or powerlifting. Buy it if you want cheap IP55 rated headphones üéß but look elsewhere for sound quality.; ; I am astonished by the price tag of 6999/- and the refurbished price of Rs. 2588/-. Upon wearing it, the item feels excessively heavy, overly snug, and extremely uncomfortable. The moment it touches your head, its weight becomes palpable. In less than 10 minutes, it's certain to induce a headache.; Philips Superb sound quality
Awesome sound quality really really good i,m totally satisfied as compared to boat; Pros: Sound quality is clear bass quality good.
Very convenient to travel with. The built quality is made to last.
Cons: Not very comfortable for long use.
Tried playing games with it there is definitely some sound lag.; Comprei o fone faz um tempinho j√° e achei que super valeu a compra. S√≥ o fato da almofada dele n√£o ser feita daquele couro sint√©tico que descasca j√° me ganha - e plus: as almofadas s√£o lav√°veis, s√≥ tem que aprender a tirar e colocar elas com jeitinho. Dentro das almofadas tem um gel que deixa a orelha fresca, √© bem confort√°vel.

Sobre o som, eu sinto ele um pouco distante, mas talvez seja porque n√£o gosto de colocar o volume no m√°ximo. Quando voc√™ usa fica com a impress√£o que o som t√° vazando pro ambiente, mas n√£o, √© bem silencioso pra quem t√° ao redor. Ele √© bem resistente tamb√©m, j√° caiu um monte de vezes no ch√£o e continua firme e forte. Ah, a dura√ß√£o da bateria √© excelente, eu at√© esque√ßo que precisa carregar e olha que eu s√≥ tenho ele e uso direto, de manh√£ at√© a noite.

Esteticamente ele pode ficar um pouco grande se seu cabelo for bem curtinho, quase raspado... o formato dele n√£o acompanha a cabe√ßa, √© meio retangular (o bom √© que n√£o amassa o cabelo nas laterais). Depois de usar por muito tempo eu sinto ele pressionando o cocoroco, bem no topo da cabe√ßa, mas nada que incomode demais.

√â isso... compensa mas depende do pre√ßo tamb√©m, bom ficar de olho nas promo√ß√µes.; Apr√®s avoir longtemps cherch√© un casque correct pour courir, et test√© sans succ√®s divers √©couteurs, celui-ci est le seul qui me convienne vraiment - il reste en place et ne bouge pas.

Son correct, largement suffisant pour le sport.

Tr√®s simple √† appairer et √† utiliser. (iPhone et Spotify dans mon cas).; Ottime cuffie, molto comode. Traspiranti, non si appiccicano all'orecchio come quelle in pelle o simil pelle, quindi sono perfette in estate o per fare sport. Qualit√† audio ottima per il prezzo.; Really pleased with these headphones! They are comfortable and stay on my head well without moving around. This is my first time using Bluetooth wireless headphones.... What a revelation! I'm so glad I tried these!
I use these headphones when out running, at night, down the country lanes where I live. At full volume, the sound is just right - no distortion (although any higher and I imagine there would be). There's a good range of sound. And I can still just about hear traffic... the lanes are quiet and I see the lights before I hear the cars anyway. I wouldn't recommend listening on full volume if you were to go running along the roads during daylight hours... But very late at night - it's great - listening to uplifting dance music, under the stars....
Connecting my phone to the headphones is really easy, and I can listen to Spotify. I can put my phone into my pocket and press 'next' or 'previous' buttons on the headphones themselves, which is really useful.
Can't believe I've been struggling with MP3 players and wired headphones all this time until now!
Don't know how long the battery lasts... But my route is 4 miles or so, and sometimes I do several of those throughout the week before I charge the headphones. I've never used up the battery.
Also - I've worn these headphones in all weathers and not had any problems!
Definitely recommended!; J'ai longtemps utilis√© des √©couteurs bluetooth pour aller courir mais ces derniers avaient le m√™me probl√®me, √† un moment l'oreillette droite ne se connectait plus. C'est donc tr√®s d√©sagr√©able d'√©couter la musique que d'une seule oreille quand on va courir.

J'ai donc utilis√© des √©couteurs cabl√©s mais l√† aussi, le cable me sautait tout le temps en plein visage ... donc d√©sagr√©able !

J'ai alors cherch√© un casque bluetooth qui serait l√©ger, confortable, qui tient bien quand on court et avec une certaine qualit√© de son et je l'ai trouv√© avec ce casque.

Je vais courir avec et j'en oublie son existence tellement il est l√©ger et confortable. Je vous le recommande !"

The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.

There is only one issue that I have observed, and that is sweating during the summer.; I have got the black color for me. Battery backup is too good and you can use with aux cable to reserve battery.

Noise cancellation is almost none, and call quality is ok(dual pairing is available so if you receive a call on phone and on your pc some video was playing it will get paused automatically , but the problem is call quality gets seriously degraded if you turn on the video - call will get garbled and you wouldn't be able to understand a single word of the person you are talking to. ear sponge quality is ok , you get one on head , and get ready to have sweaty ears in long session.

So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad. It is not good for gaming. For gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.
Thank you for reading just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.; Sound quality and battery is very good.
Price is aslo good, but product is not durable for long time... Maybe product will not work after 12 month.; Sound great,price affordable,mic quality ok hai, connectivity quickly response karta hai, plastick body hai ok hai , comfortable hai per halka sweat aata hai near ear; I bought this product about 2.5 months back, My purpose of buying this headphone is to watch lectures, binge watching of movies I was wondering for budget friendly headphone under rupees 1,000.

So, After using this product for about 2.5 months and still using it. I would like to share the likes and dislikes of this product based on my usage.

Likes :
1) Sound quality is good and crisp great for listening lectures and watching movies and other content.
2) Battery life is also good it gives output of about 15 hours my daily usage is about 4-5 hours.
3) Bluetooth range is quite good for this budget.

Dislikes :
1) It's leather quality is very bad not satisfied with its quality to the leather was ripped out within just 2 months.
2) the plastic quality is not so good you can get scratches on its body easily.
3) it consumes more time to get charge it takes around 3-4 hours for 100% charging.
4) the glue used in this headphones cushion are not applied properly it comes out of the body within 1 month only.
5) the noise cancellation is not good you can easily hear outdoor activities sound Even at full volume.

Based on this budget it's a good product from Indian Brands Zebronics but comes with a lot of comprises.

If you really want quality good headphones atleast go for budget higher than rupees 2,500 or select other brands like sony, boat and other brands.; The quality is good and and sound was low because my right side not working and some small defective but product was good üëç; The product is good but they are faking too much by telling there's ENC and Gaming mode while there's no feature like that, it's just a normal Bluetooth headphone. However portability is good, comfort is good durability i would say cheap it can break easily also aux cable is not durable, sound quality good for this price range."

The built quility is good and premium, earpads are very soft but bit small in size but it will comfortable in 2 days, connectivity is very good, good for movies and music (not bass), battery life is also very good. At first I didn't like this headphones because it has low sound with compare to my previous earphone but after using this headphone for 2 days I loved it. It has balanced sound not for bass lovers. Vocals are very clear and you can differentiate between vocals and instruments easily. If you love more vocal than bass than go for it.; Here's the TLDR: gets uncomfortable after about an hour of use if you have big ears like I do. Sounds pretty good considering the price, slightly on the bassier side, but fairly neutral overall. Best in the price range I think, at least compared to the offerings from JBL. The marshall major 3 wireless has better sound, build quality and comfort but doesn't have the voice assistant support. Skip to the last for the scores.

Allow me to explain in detail:

THE SOUND:

It sounds good. I love Sennheiser's sound signature and this one has been tuned to have a very slight bassier curve. Bassheads won't like it i suppose. Upper bass range sounds a bit muddy to my ears, though only when listened very closely. Most users won't notice it i suspect. The lower highs could use a bit more punch. It does struggle a tad to produce the very high frequencies (12khz+). I'll be honest, i do like my listening headphones to be a bit on the beassier end but I absolutely hate the way Skullcandy, Beats etc achieve that. These, however, have quite an enjoyable sound signature, especially once you tweak your eq. The headphones respond really well to eq tweaks, especially inside the Sennheiser app (the app doesn't offer a parametric eq but it does have a eq thing that lets you move around a dot and tries to adjust the eq accordingly.)

The sound stage is okay and the imaging is quite good. Instrument separation is fine for the price.

COMFORT AND BUILD:

The build quality is good. It's all plastic but the plastic feels solid. No complaints there.

However, the headphones are small for overheads. It might be just me though as I'm only really familiar with overhead headphones like the M40x, M50x, some AKGs, Beyerdynamic etc, all of which go well over the ears and are incredibly comfortable (the ATH M series NEED the Brainwavs earpads though) and all of them have a nice and gentle clamping force. Anyways, back to this pair.

The earpads are not memory-foam and the sides are unnecessarily wide, thus doesn't leave much room for the ears inside. Since I've big ears, the pads rest somewhat toward the ends of my ears, which makes them uncomfortable for longer sessions. However, the clamping force is not bad and that makes the pair relatively pleasant. I say relatively because the JBL LIVE 500BTs have a clamping force of 0.7kg (vs only about 0.2kg of these. as per testings of rtings.com), which feels like getting crushed under a rock.

The earpads are replaceable so I'm hoping that brainwavz will release some really nice and plush pads for these headphones, which should improve the comfort further. These aren't bad the way they are though. If you have smaller ears, i think you'll be perfectly happy.
UPDATE: The regular brainwavz pleather pads do fit these just fine. It makes them incredibly comfortable. Although the earpads are a tad oversized but it doesn't come off or wiggle or anything like that. They make the bass response quite weak though. Pick your poison i guess.

Tip: turning the earpads about 30¬∞ (may vary) clockwise may improve the comfort dramatically.

MISCELLANEOUS THINGS:

Battery life seems to be excellent. Noise isolation is passive but it does a decent job.

VERDICT:

I think they're worth the price and better than the competition. They're built well and they sound decent. They don't have some bells and whistles like audio passthrough but it has either better comfort or better sound quality compared to those. The inclusion of a type c port is nice. AptX low latency support is great for Android users. Overall it gets my recommendation.

SCORES, WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE PRICE:

Sound: 6.7/10
Build: 7/10
Comfort: 5.9/10
Battery: 10/10
Bluetooth range: 9/10
Bells and Whistles: 5/10; Sennheiser is reputed brand mainly for the mic and headphone for recording in studio and PA systems. If you need the pure and accurate sound reproduction this HD 350BT is some best, however a wired headphone is more recommended for studio recordings. This HD 350BT Wireless Bluetooth is not for music entertainment if you desired for heavy bass and trebles. It's noise enhance (not reduction) has superb active when you peak a call over the mobile phone. This is truly a waste of money product and I bought this by mistake on he name of the brand quality reputation. Only one thing is good that it's design and best covering ears. It looks best but works as local. It's not for music enjoy nor for peaking call over the mobile it's just for listening as it as original recordings.; Highly disappointed with a product like Sennheiser. Wrost bass.. battery backup is okay.; I have been using this headphones for a year now, since I have a piercing in my ear, the ear pads starts hurting after few hours of use. Please don't expect much of base. My power button has stopped working and now the headphones always stays on the pairing mode. A good headphone for vocals and instrument seperation until it's working. I do feel the plastic quality on this could have been better and i also feel if possible adding a bit more money to have the noise cancellation version is also a better thought than buying these.; Beautiful product. Sound quality is signature Sennheiser. Strong build. Battery life is just too good. Headphones are comfortable on ear,but would not recommend to people with big ears. In terms of microphone,I hear a slight echo of my own voice while talking,which is irritating. Could have done a better job.
The base is low, but I am more into instrumental music and these headphones have a crystal clear output in sound. They aren't excessively loud which I liked. Noice cancellation is partial.
Overall a good package by Sennheiser. I had to check out some settings tips online on youtube for pairing the headphones with other devices,it wasnt mentioned in the manual. Also about how to unpair with old devices.
4.5 stars out of 5.; I bought the 350bt for ‚Çπ6299. My 3 week experience has been great so far. This is my first purchase in the premium headphone segment.

Pros.
Great sound quality
Build quality is top notch
Bluetooth range is excellent
Battery life is AWESOME (40 hours in a single charge)
Type c charging
Dual device pairing
App support
Call quality has been fantastic
Passive noise isolation is great

Cons.
Earpads are cramped with no breathing room for one's ears.
People with larger ears might find the experience to be uncomfortable
Lack of Active noise cancellation and Ambient mode
Lack of 3.5mm audio jack

Overall the pros definitely outweigh the cons. People who prioritise comfort over everything else should stay away from the 350bt.(Sony's ch710n and Skullcandy Crusher or Hesh ANC will be more comfortable)
Highly recommeded for audiophiles who really care about the sound signature, for enthusiasts who love features like dual device pairing, app support, type c port.; bons bateria incr√≠vrel; Bonne qualit√© . Super son , agr√©able √† porter; Muy buen sonido, duraci√≥n de la bater√≠a bueno, por el precio es una excelente opci√≥n; Bought these as a set for the gym. Though not noise cancelling, the sound suppression is brilliant and they are very comfortable. Battery life is also exceptional.; Le cuffie sono ottime, qualit√† del suono pazzesca. Se siete amanti dei bassi profondi queste cuffie sono un validissimo compromesso. Ho sentito suoni mai sentiti prima in pezzi che ho ascoltato per anni! Direi che valgono assolutamente i soldi spesi, appena accese si collegano immediatamente al bluetooth del telefono senza problemi. Isolano parecchio dai rumori esterni quindi magari non passeggiate in tangenziale mentre le indossate. Leggere e gran bel design!"

Sound Quality (5/5):
The audio quality is exceptional. The sound is crisp, clear, and has a well-balanced bass. Whether I'm listening to music, watching videos, or taking calls, the Buds 2 Pro deliver an immersive audio experience.

Active Noise Cancellation (5/5):
The active noise cancellation feature works like a charm. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing me to enjoy my music without distractions. It's a game-changer for my daily commute and when working in noisy environments.

Comfort (5/5):
These earbuds are incredibly comfortable, even during long listening sessions. They fit snugly in my ears, and I never worry about them falling out. Samsung provides various ear tip options to ensure a perfect fit for everyone.

Battery Life (5/5)
The battery life is impressive. I can easily get through a full day of use with both the earbuds and the charging case. It's a relief not to constantly worry about charging them.

Connectivity (5/5):
Pairing and connecting to my Samsung device is seamless. The connection is stable, and I experience minimal dropouts. Plus, the Auto Switch feature is handy when switching between multiple devices.

Design (4/5):
The earbuds have a sleek and modern design. They're small and discreet, making them easy to wear without drawing too much attention. However, the glossy finish can be a fingerprint magnet, which is a minor drawback.

Voice Assistant Integration (5/5):
The integration with Bixby or other voice assistants is smooth and responsive. It's convenient to control music or make calls using voice commands.

In summary, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are a remarkable upgrade that delivers excellent sound quality, top-notch noise cancellation, and comfort for extended use. Whether you're a music enthusiast or need reliable earbuds for calls and productivity, these earbuds won't disappoint. My friends Amaranth AJ, Govind S, Bilal also tried these earbuds and they were really impressed with the buds. I personally will choose this earbuds to be the best earbuds that I have ever used till now. I will suggest anyone who wish to buy this product without any second thoughts.; It's been 4 days now and I thought of giving a nice feedback. The music experience has been so amazing and wonderful. This is the first time I'm using TWS with ANC enabled. I bought this on Great India Festival sale in 2023 for 7300 rs and it was a steal deal.

ANC: It totally restricts external noise but the sharp voice when someone suddenly starts speaking to you can't be restricted and that surpasses the restriction. As this was the first time I was using ANC, I was pretty much amazed how wonderful this tech is. It totally gives the right feel when listening to music and I don't think that I'll ever want non-ANC featured earphones/headphones anymore. After using these buds for 1 month, I can argue that sometimes the ANC feature doesn't work as good as the other times.

Touch control: these buds have so many features but I struggle hard when I've enabled double tap for both changing the music and controlling volume. Controlling volume is difficult to perform sometimes. You get an app for controlling them with a widget on your homescreen to turn off ANC and touch control and that widget is extremely helpful and needed app. Pixel buds have swipe gesture to control volume, maybe that feature will increase battery consumption more but it's more convenient than tapping. My worst experience was with volume control on these earbuds and I had to turn that feature off because this doesn't work satisfactorily.

Battery: With ANC enabled, I get around 4 hours of backup on buds and my case battery lasts for 2+ days. It doesn't take much time to charge. With ANC disabled I can use buds for 5+ hours.

Connectivity: I can use these buds on laptop and all my phones but not at the same time. if these are connected to one device, you'll have to disconnect to pair with other device. But it's not a big issue. You won't struggle with connectivity. Most of my devices are very old and they connect seamlessly.

24 bit and 360 degree audio: Not available for all devices, only work on samsung phones with latest ONEUI. These additional feautres are why these are costly. I don't find these features useful at all ‚Äî feel more like gimmicks to me. 360¬∞ audio is terrific, I haven't tested much but I guess you won't find this feature on any other TWS. If you don't require these features, you can go for buds2 if you don't have a budget.

Sound quality and bass: Sound and bass both are clear and balanced. You can hear details of every instrument clearly. The quality of sound is amazing and I have personally never had this experience with other earphones before.

Size, fitting and appearance: I don't know why some people criticize it for being too bulky, It's not really a big deal and easily fits in the pocket. Buds are great but you can't wear them for long time, they hurt ears if you keep wearing them for 3+ hours.

I can rate each feature individually now:
ANC: 8/10
Sound Quality: 9/10
Touch control: 7/10
Fit and finish: 8/10
Connectivity with different devices: 10/10
Battery: 9/10

Update after 6 months of use: The product's build quality is good, but Samsung is gradually reducing the sound quality with each update. The Buds2 Pro doesn't have its original audio signature anymore, for which these buds were once famous. The latest update has significantly impacted sound quality and increased treble which is hurting my ears. While there's a way to downgrade to older firmware but it's pointless that Samsung is doing this and it's not worth it considering the price you have to pay for these buds. I hope that Samsung rolls out new update with better audio signature and if it doesn't, then I'd suggest you go for other earbuds.; After trying out the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, I'm compelled to share my thoughts on these wireless earbuds.

Sound Quality: The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro deliver clear and balanced highs and mids, though the bass lacks depth and the sound stage could be broader. Instrumentation separation could also be improved, especially when compared to premium options like the Sennheiser Momentum 4.

Design and Comfort: The sleek and compact design of the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro is a noticeable improvement over previous models. However, I found them less comfortable for extended wear due to the shorter extending piece that fits into the ear. After around 30 minutes of use, discomfort and earache became apparent. A slightly longer design could greatly enhance comfort.

Comparison with Premium Headphones: When compared to premium headphones like the Sennheiser Momentum 4, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro offer similar sound balance at a fraction of the cost. While the Sennheiser headphones excel in providing a wider and deeper sound stage, as well as better instrumentation separation, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro hold their own in terms of sound quality and affordability.

Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): The ANC feature is decent but not exceptional. While it effectively reduces some background noise, it struggles to block out louder environments completely.

Overall Impression: The Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are a worthwhile purchase for their balanced sound and stylish design. However, improvements in comfort, sound stage, and instrumentation separation would undoubtedly enhance the user experience. If you're in search of budget-friendly wireless earbuds with good sound quality, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are definitely worth considering.; Ich nutze die Kopfh√∂rer nun schon einige Monate und habe bisher absolut keine Beschwerden. Sie lassen sich problemlos mit meinem Handy verbinden und verbinden sich automatisch, sobald ich sie raushole. (Wei√ü ich nicht ob das nur mit Samsung so ist oder auch mit anderen Marken)

Die Soundqualit√§t ist sehr gut.
Der Akku h√§lt lange. Obwohl ich sie h√§ufig √ºber mehrere Stunden an habe, sind sie noch nie w√§hrend des H√∂rens leer gegangen.
Sie sitzen sehr angenehm in den Ohren und st√∂ren keines wegs. Selbst wenn man sich im Bett seitlich hinlegt und mit den Ohren auf dem Kissen liegt, sind sie im Vergleich zu vielen anderen weiterhin gem√ºtlich.

Das einzige was meiner Meinung nicht allzu gut ist, ist die Ger√§uschunterdr√ºckung. Wenn man laut Musik h√∂rt und dazu Ger√§uschunterdr√ºckung an hat, funktioniert das trotzdem. Ansonsten h√∂rt man leider noch einiges von der Umgebung und kann nicht vollst√§ndig ausschalten.; Dopo un attenta ricerca sono arrivato alla conclusione che queste fossero le migliori cuffie a questo prezzo. Samsung tramite la collaborazione con harmann e akg sono riusciti a creare questo prodotto spettacolare. Qualit√† dell'audio eccellente, bassi veramente eccezionali. Unica pecca la funzionalit√† della cancellazione attiva dei rumori, che non √® alla pari di bose. Ma personalmente non la uso mai, preferisco la qualit√† del suono. Detto questo ovviamente funziona pi√π che bene la cancellazione dei rumori anche nelle cuffie samasung. √à solo l'unico aspetto dove mi sento di dire che un altro brand ha fatto meglio.; Buena calidad de sonido.
Muy c√≥modos al rato de llevarlos no se notan en la oreja
Cancelaci√≥n de ruido decente
Bater√≠a con cancelaci√≥n de ruido 6 horas y sin esta puesta alrededor de 8. El estuche vale para 3 cargas m√°s o menos
Se conecta muy r√°pido y la app de Samsung va bastante bien.
Los recomiendo, se sienten bastante premium; Ich nutze die Buds 2 Pro mit einem Galaxy S24 Ultra, die Konnektivit√§t funktioniert reibungslos.

Active Noise cancelling leistet gute Dienste, die Effektivit√§t ist etwas geringer als bei den Airpods 2 Pro, jedoch weiterhin als sehr gut zu bewerten. Durch l√§ngere Ber√ºhrung mit dem Finger aktiviert sich der Transparenzmodus, sodass man seine Umwelt oder sein Umfeld besser wahrnimmt.

Das Klangerlebnis ist subjektiv empfunden sehr gut. Die H√∂hen, Tiefen und B√§sse werden klar wiedergegeben, B√§sse klingen angenehm satt, ein verzerren kann ich in meinen genutzten Bereichen nicht feststellen.

Telefonie funktioniert wunderbar, man wird sehr gut wahrgenommen und sein Gegen√ºber h√∂rt man klar und deutlich.

Die Akkulaufzeit l√§sst bei mir als ""Vielnutzer"" keinerlei W√ºnsche √ºbrig. Habe die Buds trotz Netflix Session, Telefonie und Musik h√∂ren beim Rad fahren noch nie innerhalb eines Tages leer bekommen.

Die Verarbeitung des Cases und der Buds ist makellos. Aus meiner Sicht, stehen die Buds 2 Pro verglichen mit den Airpods Pro 2 in Sachen Klang und Verarbeitung in nichts nach, obwohl sie nahezu nur halb so teuer sind.

Zusammengefasst klare Empfehlung meinerseits, wenn man ein Galaxy Smartphone nutzt. √úber den Buds Manager hat man hier die meisten M√∂glichkeiten zur Einstellung.; Les essayer, c'est les adopter !

Je suis audiophile et vient d'un casque sennheiser, je suis habitu√© √† avoir un son propre et tres √©quilibr√©. Je cherchais avant tout des √©couteurs fid√®les dans la restitution audio, pour √©couter ma musique.

Apr√®s avoir test√© plusieurs mod√®les d'√©couteurs d√©cevants du point de vue audio, j'ai enfin trouv√© le mod√®le que je cherchais. Ces galaxy buds 2 pro sont une petite merveille et je p√®se mes mots.

Le son est parfait : bien √©quilibr√© d'origine (nul besoin de passer par un egaliseur) avec des basses magnifiques, rondes, parfaitement dos√©es contrairement √† bon nombre d'√©couteurs qui en envoient trop pour masquer la pi√®tre qualit√© des aigus et m√©diums... car oui les m√©diums et les aigus sont ultra pr√©cis et clairs dans ces galaxy buds 2 pro... la technologie a 2 transducteurs n'y est sans doute pas √©trang√®re car aucun transducteur ne peut restituer parfaitement les graves et aigus √† la fois.

Je d√©couvre par ailleurs avec stupeur l'efficacit√© de la r√©duction de bruit active que je consid√©rais comme un gadget jusqu'alors. C est incroyable √† quel point cela isole de l ext√©rieur : on est comme dans une bulle silencieuse, c est simplement g√©nial de pouvoir couper les bruits parasites de l ext√©rieur pour n entendre que sa musique... √ßa devient vite indispensable ! Je manque de points de comparaison sur l'ANC mais je constate que cela fonctionne tr√®s tr√®s bien.

Pour le reste, les √©couteurs sont confortables. Aucune g√™ne √† les porter longtemps. Les contr√¥les tactiles sont tr√®s biens... l application samsung genre est bien et permet de personnaliser les r√©glages.

En r√©sum√©, je recommande chaudement ces buds 2 pro. Ils valent largement leur prix et √† 130 euros c est un excellent rapport qualit√© prix !"

I didnt move to 1000xm5 because it doesnt fold like xm2 or bose QC. The thing that i miss the most from sony is touch. The base is not as thumpy as sony 1000xm series, oneplus cheap neckband has better thump than this. Adjusting EQ is of no use. I hope in future they add touch controls which can be disabled for those who find it annoying.; I have been researching for new headphones as my old AKG is worning out and I have went to multiple stores to experience different headphones like XM5,XM4 and its own rival QC45 and I must say I have invested some time for this and it paid me off. This Pair ANC is at another level that I forget that I'm travelling to office Bangalore. Absolute no noise at all. As soon as I put my headphones on I feel like I sit on the beach alone with me and sound of the waves.
Try this EQ setting and you will love it even more. +5,+6,+3. You can reduce the treble to -1 or -2 if you feel it too high. This is my 4 th Bose and Bose never disappoints; Sound quality is excellent, specially noise cancellation features.; Comfortable I Use It For Cycling; Perfect; ANC is good but I feel it can be great or improved

Good buy but only in SALE else it is overpriced; Bose is known for superior quality and functionality and these headphones deliver all that and more. Bose does not disappoint with this model on any level. From the superior sound quality to the design, comfort and wearability Bose is a five star with this pair of high quality headphones. I‚Äôd give it ten stars if it were possible. I just can‚Äôt say enough about the superior noise cancellation and sound quality in addition to the wearability. The excellent ergonomic design allows extremely comfortable long term wearing. The performance is impeccable as I am able to wear them all day to drown out annoying noises even when I‚Äôm not listening to anything. It‚Äôs very relaxing noise cancellation for meditation and relaxation with or without sound. Battery life is very long maybe as long as six hours or more of constant listening although I haven‚Äôt timed it yet. This model has an animated ‚ÄúSiri‚Äù type voice that tells you how much battery life is left as soon as you turn it on so you can charge it before use if necessary. They are great for focusing and concentration. So lightweight and ergonomically correct that I forget I‚Äôm wearing them sometimes. Time flies when I use them while multitasking cleaning house and listening to prerecorded books, lectures, video recipes, Tv shows, etc. I‚Äôm completely satisfied with my purchase experience and highly recommend this product. Would buy again.; If you had told me any time prior to a few weeks ago, I‚Äôd have scoffed at the thought of buying anything other than the cheapest headphones I could find at Walmart.

Well, I found myself in Staples recently and was bored waiting for my son. I checked out the Bose headphones on display and was immediately blown away at how immersive the sound was.

Back home I was using my cheap headphones daily for workouts. But now I knew what I was missing out on.
I had to have them.

I researched between the QC at $409 and the QC Ultra at almost $500, and read ++ reviews. Mostly here on Amazon.
In the end I opted for the QC, ordering it through Amazon and not Staples, because Staples does not allow the return of headphones and for that price I wasn‚Äôt going to risk it. I would wait the 4-5 days and know that if I wasn‚Äôt satisfied, that Amazon would give me a return.

Well, I have to say, I‚Äôm overall impressed, but I also realize that my level of impression is very subjective, coming from someone who has never spent more than $25 on a pair of headphones for myself.

It is a bit too big for my head but they still fit good for workouts, unless I‚Äôm doing something like push-ups or planking, or leaning forward, they will start to slip off.
The other day I experienced this while leaning over my counter trying to jam stuffing into a gaping turkey hole.
But I digress.
The sound cuts out every now and then as others have noted. I only use these for music.
I love the ‚Äúaware‚Äù and ‚Äúquiet‚Äù feature. And the battery life is astounding. After the first full charge, I made sure to use them until it drained the battery completely. It lasted just about 24hrs. I didn‚Äôt listen to music the entire time, maybe 5-6hrs total, but the headphones were turned on the whole time.

The next time I charged them, I used them and turned them off in between. It‚Äôs now been 48hrs and I still am at 50% battery. I feel I‚Äôve used them quite a bit, so I‚Äôm very impressed with the battery at this point.

That‚Äôs another thing - I appreciate that it tells you your battery life when you turn the headphones on.

They are not heavy on the head and it doesn‚Äôt create sore spots.

The sound is crisp and immersive.

The ‚Äúquiet‚Äù mode works really well even when you aren‚Äôt listening to music. It‚Äôs very calming.

I really considered getting the Ultras and wasn‚Äôt sure if I was missing out on anything better by sticking to the QCs. So I went back to Staples to test out the Ultra and realized there were some things about it that I didn‚Äôt like after all, such as the very sensitive finger swipe volume. I much prefer the buttons of the QC. It‚Äôs the little things sometimes. I just overall felt like it wasn‚Äôt worth spending that extra hundred dollars.

I‚Äôm conclusion, I love my headphones but I‚Äôm just a small town bumpkin that is amused by shiny things. Still can‚Äôt believe I spent $400 on headphones though.

I have been very much satisfied with this product as the purpose for which I purchased this product was office teams call. This product has worked well, most importantly the mute function with mic up works like a charm. I am not supposed to sit in-front of my laptop to attend a meeting, neither I have to worry to mute and unmute the mic when I am supposed to speak. The range is brilliant, I even left my laptop in cabin and went to fetch a cup a coffee while attending the meeting, I was really surprised, the connection never failed. Next great thing brilliant battery, the longest meeting I have attended with this headphone was 6 hrs. Still the battery remaining was 40%. Guys this headphone is not meant for listening high fidelity music, it is meant for pure office purpose for listening to people clearly in a meeting and for communicating clearly to them, which this headphone has done brilliantly. Kudos to Logitech.; I purchased this as I was getting some budget from office. I have been using this for more than 2 months now. The mic is awesome for meetings.
Audio quality is great for meetings and occasional movie or gaming session. Awesome battery life.

Conns:
1. Bit Pricy
2. When I turned off mic by rotating the mic feature, it still did not mute it and team was able to hear me.( This happened ONLY once).; ; Giving this review after 6 +months of use.

Things I like very much:
1. Will not be a problem even after wearing this for whole day 14+hrs.
2. Mic filters out all the unwanted noises and keeps the voice crisp.
3. Battery back up is excellent will last couple of work days very easily. with no music playing in between. one day if there is some music playing.
4. Oh I love playing music with this, can be easily compared with any of Sony's or Boses
5. Noise cancelling is OK. Not so great not so bad too.
6. Auto muting when mic is up very intuitive and over rides machines mute. so that is great.
7. Works great with google meet, Zoom and Microsoft teams.; I needed a good bluetooth over the ear headphones for office call primarily. I had a Jabra one from office which is very good but it is wired and it is on the ear so it was painful for long calls. Looked through various products and came across this. It comes with a extended mic which is good.

For office calls/ remote meetings - I have been using this for a month and connectivity is good for single device and I am taking all calls through this without issue.

For multiple device pairing
When connected with laptop and phone together, the behaviour is inconsistent. Some times when I am connected to both and taking call from phone, the audio suddenly goes off. So not good for using with two devices.

Build Quality
The build quality is just Ok. It looks very fragile and I have to handle it very carefully. I doubt the durability as well. Not sure when it stops working, it looks so fragile. The earcups are also not great lookng. But since it is over the ear, it is comfortable for wearing for long time.

Audio quality
Call quality is OK. I am not so much into music so can't say much. But my primary purpose of taking calls is being server till now.; There is no noise cancellation on as mentioned in list and bluetooth automatically disconnected while using continuous 20-30minutes; The biggest problem with overhead headsets is they are very heavy on the head and neck. Zone vibe is perfect for that. Very light on head and neck. I loved clarity of voice and flip to mute option is cherry on the cake ‚ù£Ô∏è; Its plasticky and seems so flimsy that it would break if you even twist it a bit. The mic is useless and catches all the noise in the background. The sound quality is worse than BOAT headphones.; This Logi headset is more like a pair of high qualit
y headphones in design and quality. And you can wear them for long periods because of the soft and fitted pads; My wife enjoyed using these headphones, and she thought they were pretty. It was very disappointing that they died and would not re-charge after less than 3 months of use.

They were generally good:
Bluetooth being able to connect to multiple devices and automatically switch sound input depending on what as playing. Sound quality of using microphone was good. Audio quality was good. The wide ear cushions didn't squish the ear if you were listening for long periods. Also liked that when the microphone was in the raised/put away state that it was neatly tucked away.

Battery life seemed to be okay. We never really took notice of how long the battery lasted, or if the battery status stated was close to the actual value. Not being able to recharge is obviously a major downside and made the headphones unable to be used. I wish these had better quality batteries.; Very comfortable and excellent audio quality. I love it.; Listening to music and videos are fine. However any calls including teams requires the mic boom to be down to hear. Pressing the mute button on the boom or lifting the boom mutes hearing anyone as well. Can only mute in the teams software. If you can live with that they are a comfy pair of headphones at a good price; Great set of headphones, lightweight and does the job. Only complaint, they can chew through charge fairly quickly and for all day meetings, need to sometimes work with cable connected. Upside is they are quick to recharge."

- Call quality is excellent plus it cuts off ambient noise while you are talking which is great. So if you are into taking lot of calls then this is the perfect choice as it keeps you focused as well ensures the quality of your voice renders perfectly to the listener on the other side.
- Looks modern and sleek.
- ANC is really good with choice of setting the level unlike QC35ii where there is zero, mid, high with NC700 you can choose individual range for what is low what is mid and high.
- Ear pads are really of great quality and fit perfectly
- Sound quality is balanced renders natural sounds without adding too much of effect but if you like thump then may not be the best one out there.
- Touch controls are really good esp to pause by just double tapping is really neat
- Putting it in the case is pretty easy unlike the foldable qc35ii. I've read reviews where people preferred foldable ones but in my personal preference keeping it in the box is pretty easy compared to qc35ii where you had to figure out which side to fold and then take care while putting it in the box that you have used the padding perfectly.

Cons
- The metal band makes it a little heavy compared to qc35ii and you can feel it during the initial use but will get used to it.
- Butons are very flimsy and don't give the feel as qc35ii controls, they have tried to make them small and sleek but in doing so have made them really to thin and looks to be of cheap quality
- Not much difference in sound quality compared to qc35ii so not a big upgrade if you are planning for.
- Pairing with the app to start using it.; Build quality is very good. Sound is just super, I personally like balnced bass and optimized for all sorts of sounds. It serves that purpose. Yeah, price little high but over all product is good. One thing is, AUX cable they designed like, headphone side 2.5 mm and other side 3.5 mm jack. May be they wanted to use only their accessories :); Immaculate sound quality, great build, fabulous ANC - an all-round winner!; Astounding noise cancellation, beautiful design and poor quality software support.

1. The noise cancellation is unrivalled. A truly worthy competitor in this field. Compare it with the world‚Äôs topmost racing cars in the field of noise cancellation.

2. It looks and feels like a piece of modern art. If you have an eye for sleek design, minimalism and ‚Äúless is more‚Äù thought process, you would appreciate these. Pitch it against any other headphone in the market side by side, and you could see the difference in build quality and design superiority.

3. Software. Bose should fire at least half of its software engineering people. Looks like Bose doesn‚Äôt quiet really know what Quality Software means in 2021. Buggy iOS app, pathetic support site etc. it looks like Bose spent a ton of money in hiring top notch UI/UX designers and cut corners by hiring stupid and cheap app developers. The can‚Äôt be said to be reliable at all. It looks like force fit component in an otherwise beautiful and rock solid product which is worthy of being put at MOMA (Museum of Modern Art). I am guessing Bose relies heavily on third party software developers who don‚Äôt have any idea of what a ‚ÄúBose‚Äù product really means and who the ‚ÄúBose‚Äù people are. In all, software is a huge let down.

4. Innovation and features. The world has made major technological advancements extremely fast and Bose seems still locked in its own research labs and in their ivory towers. Why Bose? Why the attitude? Why are you not adopting the best codecs available out there? Who says you have to clutter your product? Look at Sony and Apple and learn from their best success. Don‚Äôt think that you can remain hidden in your own research labs and can do all the innovation yourself. Because, a day might come, you will be paying a heavy price for this. If you don‚Äôt innovate and compete, you will die.

Summary:
This product would have been an undisputed leader 3 years ago, but not right now. Sorry Bose, others like Sony and Apple have worked very very hard and they deserve the respect and the market a bit more than you for this product.; Awesome noise cancelling headphones ever; It's just been 1 day since I received them and I can't get over how sturdy, compact and beautful these are. Having worn it for more than an hour, I felt no discomfort at all. Its multi-device connection also works well - it's connected simultaneously to my laptop and mobile.; Son unos aud√≠fonos incre√≠bles con una gran cancelaci√≥n de ruido , tambi√©n cubren bien los o√≠dos y son c√≥modos , las personas de cabeza grande no tienen nada que tener , yo los compr√© por qu√© quer√≠a unos que cubrieran el o√≠do completo , fueran c√≥modos y de gran calidad de materiales y estos lo son; Love everything about the headphone/headset.

The bluetooth connectivity is breeze and the sleep/wake up mode is really fast and accurate as it detects the headset being worn.

The only con i have is the battery life lasts for a day and required to be charged. But it is not a deal breaker.

I use this more for Microsoft Teams call or phone call, the audio is crystal clear and the mic is pretty good.

The NC is definitely very good for the cost of the headphones.; These are not perfect as headphones go, but they are literally the nicest noise cancelling headphones that any amount of money can buy. They have their ups and downs. I'm going to talk in depth about each of these, but overall these are the best noise cancelling headphones money can buy, so even when it comes to their downsides, you can't do better.

First, if you're a regular consumer, you'll be blown away by the sound quality. However, if you're an audiophile used to audiophile grade open back headphones like the Sennheiser HD800, these fall short of audiophile levels of sound quality. Let me explain why that is.

Sound quality wise, the sound quality is overall spectacular, but it has two problems. Bass is way overemphasized, and the treble is rolled off. The treble issue is in my opinion the only really major flaw you have to deal with in these headphones. It's really a shame. Even with EQ, there's no good way to make up for the treble problem because the high end is just always a little lacking.

Bass is massively overemphasized, but everyone seems to do that these days, and most people seem to love it. Thankfully, you can just lower the bass in the EQ and it works fine, but from an audiophile perspective it's still a mark against it. You can also raise the bass if you want to lose your hearing and cause brain damage from the thump. These things will thump so hard that it'll give you a concussion.

Aside from those two downsides, instruments sound absolutely spectacular with amazing definition, separation, and clarity, it's just really unfortunate that they rolled off the treble. It'd be nice if the bass wasn't so overemphasized, but the bass at least is understandable since it seems to be what most people want. I will say however that the mid is absolutely spectacular, so there's that.

Even at their best, if you're a real audiophile, these don't hold up to the sound quality of high end audiophile open back headphones by Sennheiser like the HD650 or HD800. These are consumer grade, very top end consumer grade, but they don't reach the heights of real audiophile territory. For most people though, these will blow you away.

Noise cancelling wise, these are the best money can buy. I've tried other noise cancelling headphones, and these destroy everything that I've ever tried. It's a night and day difference in terms of the overall quality and effectiveness of the noise cancelling compared to other noise cancelling headphones.

However, they're not totally perfect. I have a bunch of air filter fans running full blast all the time, and it reduces their volume by 90+%, but it's a little inconsistent. Some of the inconsistency comes from just how the headphones sit in my head, if I get them just right, it mutes probably 98% of the sound, but if they're just a little off, it drops to between 90-95%. Sometimes it just seems to work better than other times with no apparent explanation. 90% is still a ton of noise reduction. Be aware though that you can still hear things, they're just quiet. Like if you pass a fan while walking, you can still hear it, it's just quiet.

There is sometimes a slight amount of pressure from the noise cancellation, but it's very minimal, and a lot of the time there's actually none.

Next, we get into the real premium stuff. You're paying like $400 for this, so let's talk about what you're really paying for: the creature comforts and luxury that get overlooked at lower price ranges...

For example, the case for these headphones is simply amazing. It feels extremely premium, it has a nice touch, it's light but durable, it has this lovely leathery material that is a joy to hold. It just feels like a million bucks. Even the zipper is nice! The internal layout is likewise spacious, protective and just overall very high quality.

Same with the headphones themselves. As an object that you hold in your hand, these things simply feel incredible. They're unbelievably light, I don't know how they made it feel this light. The headband literally feels like a cloud, it almost melts in your hand. I've never felt anything like it. It is insanely soft with this beautiful smooth leather feeling, yet it doesn't collapse when you wear it. I don't even understand how that works, but it does.

These are the most comfortable set of headphones I have ever put on my head by far. It feels like you're wearing a cloud. It's crazy. The clamp force is so low that I can wear these for hours and hours on end and they just feel insanely comfortable the entire time.

Even just holding these headphones physically, they feel like a million bucks. Like they've got these buttery smooth moving collapsible cans, yet they feel solid and durable, and they have this lovely smooth feeling to them.

These are the things you're really paying for when you pay $400. It's just all those little details and luxuries that really make it. They put a lot of luxury into the things outside the actual speakers, and it shows. They feel super premium in your hands, they're a beautiful shape, they're insanely comfortable to wear, they have this elegant simple design to them, and their case is outstanding. Seriously, if you hold the case and headphones of any of the other noise cancelling headphones in your hands, they just don't feel as nice as this.

Overall, I really wish they hadn't rolled off the treble. That's its one major flaw. However, these are so good that I can't go back to anything else (other than my open back audiophile sennheisers for serious listening). These are like the ultimate casual headphones for every day use. Watching TV? Use these. Going on an airplane? Use these. Going to the gym? Use these. Going for a walk? Use these. Unless all you want to do is sit down and seriously listen to some high quality music in a quiet room with audiophile headphones, you should be using these.

These are your ultimate every day use headphones. If you're a normal consumer who doesn't care about audiophile grade stuff, these will absolutely blow your mind. Even if you're an audiophile, you'll probably end up addicted to them for every day normal use. I'm kindof addicted to them myself, to be honest.; Exactly what I‚Äôm expecting from lead brands. Everything is top notch about this headphone.; ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤ÿ© ÿ¨ÿØÿß"

Flexibility to move up to 100ft/30m away from your connected device; Leather-feel ear cushions and on-the-ear design for all-day use,"As soon as I received this, I started using this. There was a little challenge in terms of getting delivery early but as soon as I raised a query, the seller was quite responsive and did provide immediate response. I did end up getting delivery four days before the timelines provided. With Jabra, I never actually had any doubts with quality of headset. Bluetooth connection was effortless and the sound quality is absolutely great. Noise cancellation seems good as I did not get any feedback from person on other side about any background noise. Liked the box in which you can keep the headset. It really helps! Yes it is expensive but I am hoping that this will last for years to come!; I was worried whether it will work on Linux and on MSFT product like Teams, and happened to see that it worked on Linux with both Zoom and Teams calls.
Without need to install any software nor had to keep configuring sound settings like I had to do for JBL bluetooth headphone, where it would default to system speaker. But in case of Jabra, whenever Jabra headset is connected I dont have to configure anything and works like charm. Another good part, I can go on mute just by lifting mic - I liked this simple tweak which also lets my family members know that I can listen to them.

BTW I have Ubuntu 20.04; Battery life is low. But voice clarity and Mike is capturing low voice very well with noise cancellation.; Perfect headphones for office calls. Can be used as Bluetooth headphones for music too but i generally use it for office with usb connector. Too convenient to use . Good battery life and the best part is the ANC, works like a charm. Only minor issue im facing is with the adjustment over head. Its a bit lose . N ya price is a bit high . But if office pays for it . Its the best option to buy; Audio quality while it is in operation is good. Nose cancellation is also good. However, all of that noise cancellation is nullified due to sharp electric disturbance type noises on connect disconnect call drops and many other situations -not sure but happens quit a it. Is extremely irritating to the year and is louder than the normal volume. Do not expect this from such an expensive device.
Not sure when it is connected and when it is not. Each of my calls starts with multiple 'am I audible?' and then a few switch off/ switch on routines.
No indication, its running out of charge while on call, suddenly we are out of the audio on the call. Drops connection on connecting the charging cable. Need to try multiple things to connect back.

Update post some further usage:
- suddenly disconnects from calls with no charge. No prior notification on this. Have to connect the cable to recharge. Subsequent to this, have to try a few things to get back on call.
- the sudden high noise spikes periodically are still present.
Downgraded the rating as these are not expected at this price point and under 3 months post purchase.; You will find a wide variety of headsets for music, but this one is built specifically for voice calls. The call clarity for me as well as the other party is greatly enhanced through its noise cancelling. The battery lasts one full day and its lightweight and comfortable for daily use.; Start getting pain in right ear after extended usage (>1 hour). Noise cancellation is very poor. Not worth at all to spend 33K for product which is such poor quality. you expect a world class product when you are spending 33K; Great sound quality, superb noise cancellation and a decent battery life.; mesmo ap√≥s 4 horas com ele n√£o tenho mais dores de cabe√ßa; These are great for call centre use as they have ANC Active Noise Cancelling. Manufacturer has a great warranty, Battery last all day and even multiple days if used as a Voice over IP phone headset. Works with many VOIP and meeting systems. Can connect via Bluetooth to both a PC and a mobile devise.; (update on July 17, 2019)
The Jabra support turned out to be superb in resolving a hardware problem I had. The USB connector fell apart for some reason, and I reached out to get a replacement. The exchange was simple and efficient:
- ""What is the problem?""
-""I need to replace the USB connector""
-""Ok take a picture of the product where the serial number is, and provide your purchase receipt""
- ""here you go""
- (7 days later) Package shows up and I am good to go.

(original review)
I really need a good headset for when I work remotely and this one is exactly what I was looking for.

Pros:
* Easier to hear in a noisy environment with the noise cancellation on earphone. I keep forgetting how cool noise cancellation works.
* Easy to talk with noise cancellation on Microphone. It is not 100% noise free but in the case you have no other choice, noice cancellation and the mute button do the trick.
* Connect to a micro USB and Bluetooth, making it easy to switch between computer and phone
* Wireless
* Mute indicator on the micro USB adaptor so that you don't speak to the void by mistake.
* Lift the mic to mute automatically.
* The tip of the mic has a magnetic piece to allow it stick to the headset.
* You can turn on voice assistance, which tells you how many hours you have left on the battery.
* The listen-in feature is cool when I realize that the headset is picking up the sounds around me and magnifying them through the earphone.

Cons, minor things:
* I had to turn the voice assistance off beacuse it got a bit annoying. I wish I could just turn it on for the battery life
* You can flatten it but it does not fold. The carry case is a bit bulky so make sure you have enough room in your bag
* Sometimes the sound does not come up until one second after you start the video. It is as if the headset puts itself to sleep and wakes up when there is sound coming in. It is fine once you get used to it, otherwise, you might try to press buttons and end up confusing yourself.

Here's a detailed review of this wireless earbud offering:

**Design and Comfort:**
The Zeb Bang Pro comes in an ergonomic and sleek design that fits comfortably in my ears. They are lightweight and stay securely in place even during workouts. The earbuds also have touch-sensitive controls for play/pause, skip tracks, and volume adjustment, which are quite responsive.

**Sound Quality:**
In terms of sound quality, these earbuds deliver crisp and clear audio. The bass is punchy, the mids are well-balanced, and the highs are sharp. Whether I'm listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls, the audio quality has been consistently impressive.

**Connectivity:**
Pairing the Zeb Bang Pro with my devices was a breeze. The Bluetooth connection has been stable, and I haven't experienced any dropouts during usage. These earbuds also support mono mode, allowing me to use either earbud individually if needed.

**Battery Life:**
One of the standout features of the Zeb Bang Pro is its exceptional battery life. With around 7-8 hours of playback time on a single charge, I rarely find myself needing to recharge them. The charging case provides additional backup, extending the total usage time to a substantial length.

**Call Quality:**
Call quality is another area where these earbuds shine. The built-in microphone captures clear audio, and I've had no issues with call clarity, whether indoors or in noisy environments.

**IPX4 Rating:**
The IPX4 rating makes the Zeb Bang Pro sweat and splash-resistant, making them suitable for workouts and outdoor activities. However, they may not be suitable for submersion in water.

**Value for Money:**
Considering the features and performance, the Zeb Bang Pro offers great value for its price point. It competes well with more expensive earbuds in terms of sound quality and battery life.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the Zebronics Zeb Bang Pro wireless earbuds are a solid choice for those seeking a budget-friendly yet high-quality audio experience. Their comfortable design, impressive sound quality, long battery life, and ease of use make them a commendable option in the wireless earbud market. Whether you're a music enthusiast or just need reliable earbuds for everyday use, the Zeb Bang Pro won't disappoint.; Sound quality is good, product is overall good but there is some lacks like voice calling issues sometimes and this is not very comfortable to wear it for a long time.

Voy a comenzar aclarando que el pedido llego justo el d√≠a de hoy as√≠ que mis impresiones son muy tempranas, as√≠ que puede que me este dejando llevar un poco por la emoci√≥n.

La verdad es que estoy impresionado, en cuanto los sacas de su empaque el producto se ve de muy buena apariencia, algo ligeros pero nada que asuste. Las almohadillas son muy c√≥modas, el colch√≥n de la diadema es justo, no es incre√≠ble, pero es bastante c√≥modo, hay muchos productos de este precio que no tienen ni eso.
Los cables auxiliares que vienen con los aud√≠fonos son buenos, decentes al menos. Tambi√©n vienen con una bolsita para cargar los aud√≠fonos, que tampoco es la gran cosa, pero es un buen agregado.

En cuanto al sonido, la verdad es que son excelentes. No poseo aud√≠fonos de alta gama, pero si he probado varios aud√≠fonos en mi trabajo (Soy editor de video en un estudio de mi ciudad) y la verdad es que como primer impresi√≥n, no me parece que le pidan mucho a modelos como los Audio-Technica M20X.

Si bien no son aud√≠fonos que se recomiendan para producci√≥n o monitoreo de audio, sinceramente creo que tienen un poco de ambos mundos, la respuesta de audio parece ser lo suficientemente buena como para edici√≥n de video o audio sencilla, as√≠ como para uso de entretenimiento. Los bajos no son abrumadores como lo ser√≠an en unos Beats, hay muy buen espaciado entre los sonidos de la m√∫sica, la voz es clara y el aislamiento pasivo es muy bueno.

Veo porque muchos se ir√≠an por unos aud√≠fonos como los ath-m20x u otras opciones de la misma gama, pero la verdad es que creo que como aud√≠fonos de d√≠a a d√≠a me parecen mejor opci√≥n, m√°s c√≥modos e incluso m√°s lindos a la vista... Con el extra de que su respuesta es lo suficientemente buena como para trabajar de forma un poco m√°s profesional."

Liked the place where buttons configured on the left cup and looks premium. Grey and golden makes it classy. Audio jack included and connects well. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.
Thank you very much,

For me, these truly wireless earbuds (TWS) have changed everything. No more juggling tangled cables or having trouble moving around. Whether I'm at the gym, driving, or just lounging around the house, they're ideal for listening to music on the go. What I adore most about them is this: * Crystal-clear sound: The sound is incredibly clear, with deep bass and sharp highs. * Snug and pleasant fit: A variety of ear tips sizes are included to provide a secure and comfortable fit that holds throughout movement. * Long battery life: With additional charges from the charging case, I can listen for hours on a single charge. Easy-to-use touch controls are available for playback, volume, and calling on the earphones.
These are really impressive wireless earbuds. They're an excellent choice for anyone seeking a high-end, fashionable, and practical listening experience. The following are some other items you may want to include in your review: * The particular brand and type of your earbuds * The pricing * The call quality * The noise-canceling capabilities (if applicable) * The price I hope this is useful.; Been using this for about 2 months. For ‚Çπ999, it's a really good product.
They connect fastly and has a good audio quality, bass too. Tuch gestures work really well. Both the case and the buds are lightweight so it's good to carry along. Different sizes and colored earpieces are provided, which I would say is great. Charging cable is also of good quality, though it's short.

Connectivity ranges to like 2 rooms in house and about 6-8 hours of playback, so it's not bad. Though the build quality is little poor as one of the earbud's piece came off from a fall. It wasn't broken, was able to join it back and worked well.

Good earbuds; This earbuds gives good sound quality. The design is also good. Bluetooth range is not that good. Battery life is excellent. Overall a seamless listening experience. It gives a outstanding performance and value. I got it just for 799/-. A good deal indeed.; The quality of the product is good but the only thing I don't like which is it does not fix properly in our ear and often got fallen from my ear. Otherwise the quality and sound quality is good; This airbuds is the best buds in the price range... I'm use hardly and enjoyed very much. I don't say that this is the best but ‚Çπ799 it's a good option. It's built quality is very impressive and sound quality decent... And performance avarage because this is not a gameing buds
I'm impressed; First purchase of a noise producr. I got this for 799. It's a steal. Great packaging and attention to details inside the box.
Coming to the product, well it's too good for the price but definitely not the best for all music genres. Tonal quality is preserved and it doesnt even need to be above 40 to 50% volume. Ergonomics could be a challenge for some. Doesn't absolutely snug in the ear without paining
Play around with the eq to get the most out of it
It is hands down better than any at this price range. Highly recommend; Good for listening music as well as for calling, clear audio, better battery life, easy charging, easy to carry.; Usage:
Regularly used for calls and watching videos.

Likes:
Attractive design and serves its purpose well. Offers good value for its price point.

Dislikes:
Fragile casing design; disassembled after a single drop. Lack of noise cancellation, which was unexpected and disappointing.

Conclusion:
These earbuds are functional for calls and video watching, with a pleasing design and reasonable price. However, durability issues and the absence of expected noise cancellation detract from the overall experience."

(5 stars for sound / 4 stars for build quality)

AKG is an Austrian company, now owned by Harman International of the famous harman/kardon brand of hi-fi equipment and JBL.

If you're looking for a good pair of budget headphones for an Immersive listening experience, the K92 is perfect. They may not be the best looking ones, but the metal frame makes them quite sturdy, while most expensive brands are made completely of plastic.

I bought these headphones purely for listening to music via my computer. The ear cups of my previous (decent) AKG K52s had become scruffy so I wanted to change and after scouting several hi-fi audio websites, decided to upgrade to the K92 which had good recommendations as opposed to the K72.

The headphones deliver crisp, clear sound with no or minimal distortion (depending on your audio source or file). They have have a good audio frequency bandwidth (16 - 22000 Hz) which provides a wide dynamic range which means you get bold bass and clear treble. The low impedence of 32 ohms means that the headphones can be driven easily at low volume by a computer sound card without the need for an additional amplifier. A 40 mm driver delivers good bass which is not too punchy, but just right since these are studio monitoring headphones.

On the downside, I am already noticing slight wear on the earcups (which I believe are replaceable).

Overall, for the price, the AKG 92 is a steal. If you're into classical music, jazz, easy or popular music, I'd recommend these highly. Go for them without a doubt.

Pros:

* 40 mm driver delivers good low bass frequencies (not too punchy)

* Low impedence (32 ohms) gives clear sound at low volume

* Audio frequency bandwidth: 16 - 22000 Hz gives bold bass, good midtone and clear treble (very good for the price)

* Earcups fit well (tightly) over the ears providing passive noise cancelling (not active)

* Very enjoyable for classical music, jazz, popular and general listening

* Fairly decent build quality (metal frame as opposed to full plastic)

Cons:

* Earcups degrade after a year of use

* As with any over ear headphones, your ears become hot after prolonged use (should not be a problem in cold weather or an air-conditioned environment)

* None otherwise; i'm not an audiophile, or someone who makes/produces music, so i didn't buy these with the intent of using them as ""studio monitors"". i just needed a set of comfortable, over-ear 'phones primarily for home use (not commute) that both look and sound good and don't cost a lot. very casual, regular usage; no professional stuff. and for someone with similar requirements, i would definitely implore them to check these out.

i love the design. no complaints wrt the material used. incidentally, i was planning on buying the cheaper k52s because of their all black body, but i decided against it because i prefer the cushioning on this one. the look is great too. these are probably the only pair of headphones that don't make me look crazy.

the comfort is decent. lmao i actually forgot that these have no adjustable slider thing and instead have the self-adjusting headband, but either way, it feels okay. the earcups are huge and so would completely engulf anyone's ears. i'm 6', have a relatively large head and ears, so these were actually good for me. none of that sharp pain you get from on-ears.
caveat: when you wear these, if your ears are big, especially if they are more ""out"" (basically, protrude outward from your head in a more noticeable way), then they might touch the inside of the cans, which feels... weird, for sure. it doesn't cause like immense discomfort, but it's still weird and does cause some strain after a while because your ears are literally pressing against the inside of the cup. also, after a while, your ears might feel warm too. not hot, just slightly warm.

the cord is, yes, very long. again, not a problem for me because i'm not using these while commuting. and i don't think these are sweatproof, waterproof, foldable, etc., but then again they're not made to be used on public transit üíÄ the context of use matters. they're meant for the studio and yeah, since we're all holed up in our houses anyway, they're great for use inside the house too, granted all you do is just listen to music and chill.

the sound quality is not remarkable or anything, but it's good enough! you won't find me raving about these for ""how amazing they sound"", but they do sound very good, especially for the price. no complaints with the sound quality esp. given the price.
although, a comparable alternative would be the oneodio headphones that a lot of reviewers really like and i did also consider them, but (personally) their design was too tacky and too close to an on-ear pair which only means one thing for people with big ears: pain. but yeah, none of that ""extra bass"" bs that i absolutely detest. the music sounds clear and balanced.

caveat: i keep reaching for the wire to change the song constantly forgetting that this doesn't have button controls (or even a mic, but hey, can't complain too much) üò≠ if you're someone who does want these extra features, check out the oneodio pair for sure.
also, the noise cancellation on these is... not good, period. like ""i could hear my fan through these when i wasn't playing anything"" not good. it's not terrible, but it's just not there, really.

and okay, i know there's a whole conversation about studio/monitor headphones not being compatible with regular smartphones involving a lot of technical jargon (""impedance"", ""impedance matching"", etc.), but i don't think you'd have to worry about that stuffl with these. i use these with my redmi note 10 pro to listen to spotify, google podcasts, local music and also to watch videos/movies on youtube, netflix, prime video and i haven't encountered any issues! i believe they'd work just fine with any modern smartphone.

in all, these are a great pair and i would say i'm satisfied with my purchase!; No microphone, no bluetooth, no noise cancellation, no branding markup. Everything you pay is for sound and build quality.

Very lightweight, flexible and self adjusting. Extremely comfortable for extended use. Clean, balanced, high resolution sound. Suitable for all kinds of audio.

Only note, you need a good port to get the most out of it. Works great on my computer. But when I plug it into my ps5 controller, it's fine. But not very loud.; The headphone is lightweight. It is over-the-ear, and my ear completely goes inside the cup. It does not press my ears, so it is very comfortable. The sound quality is awesome. The bass is very well balanced. You can hear every low pitch and high pitch, as well as every instrument in the music, very clearly. I use this to compose music in FL Studio. It is a nice headphone for gaming too. The cable is 3 meters long. I recommend this headphone for everyone, and for this price, it is a good deal.; I had two pairs of AKG240's in the past and several other brands since. All between $100 and $200 a set. These cans sound as good or better. Very defined. Good response! A little lacking in bass (hence the 4 rating) but they make up for it in overall definition and uncoloured sound. I hope to enjoy these for years to come. Great product!; Fone de √≥tima qualidade, muito confort√°vel. Voce pode ficar horas com o fone e nem percebe que est√° com o fone. O que eu achei ruim √© que o fone vem com um cabo grande (3 metros). √â muito cabo.; Excelente rango de respuesta audible, sin ser un equipo extra potente o extra bass, permite trabajar audio en sala, estudio o reproducir c√≥modamente m√∫sica para disfrute. Excelente desempe√±o con audio 3D-7D; Como en la caja te marca son para estudio son muy confortables te tapan toda la oreja el material es de muy buena calidad menos el cable es como los de iPhone buena calidad pero muy delicados y se escuchan muy bien; These are the best closed back headphones I've run across for the money with good bass, smooth sound throughout the range,and no particular coloration above the bass to the highs. The only two drawbacks would be that for closed back headphones, the isolation isn't the best, especially for smaller heads, and the overall sound character isn't as airy and open sounding with that almost laser imaging that can be achieved with the open backs, which would be at least twice the cost for those for such tonal balance as these. Sensitivity is also decent and not hard to drive with various headphone amps."

Liked the place where buttons configured on the left cup and looks premium. Grey and golden makes it classy. Audio jack included and connects well. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.

Yes, i agree these headphones are highly expensive, some may say you can purchase Apple Airpods, Boss, Sennheiser, and other audio equipment options, but trust me nothing beats these bad boys.

I am not a tech reviewer, but since being a musician, a music connoisseur myself and a huge fanatic of accessories such as headphones, earphones and smart gadgets, i can tell, these headphones are a revolution to the sound industry. I'll be quoting every pros and cons that i've personally come across and might help a few of you who decide to purchase this beauty.

Pros:

1. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): Let's talk about people who love listening to their music without any external interference while working, walking, running, working out, during a flight, or any other mode where they'd use them, ANC is a boon. Switch to ANC, you'll have the minimum of the minimum noise entering your ears. Only sounds close to you can reach at a very low level, else wise, you won't feel a thing in your ear. Be prepared for some bashing from your parents when they scream your name on top of their voices, and you've got that ANC kicked in.

2. 3 Ambience Sound Control (ASC) ON: Apart from the ANC, there are two more features that these bad boys offer. ASC when active gives you a chance to listen to your surroundings at a certain level where you can be aware of people speaking, birds chirping, children hauling in the park, and other sounds. This feature enables one to understand the surrounding noises and doesn't feel isolated.

3. Ambience Sound Control (ASC) OFF: When ASC is disabled or switched off, you can listen to your surrounding voices in a much denser state, ie. much more clearly in comparison to when the ASC is enabled. This feature is much similar to the ASC ON, just a slight difference of pitch and volume of the surrounding entering your ears.

4. Head Phones Connect by Sony: Let's talk about the main functioning unit of these headphones, the app provided by Sony under the name of Head Phones Connect. You can download it from the App store if you are an iPhone user just like me, as well as from the play store for android users.

This app is highly functional as well as quite intact providing a list of various functions such as adaptive sound control which is highly recommended to lazy people just like me. Once all set up, the app detects your actions and locations frequently, and switches the headphones settings automatically.

In addition, if you are a daily user of these headphones just like me, the app tracks your daily attributes such as at what certain volume do you like listening you music, which mode do you mostly use, which location do you travel, and then adjusts the headphones as per your choice.

One feature which at first startled me a lot but i really got impressed by it which is the Speak-to-chat feature. It's always annoying to either pull your phone out of your pocket and pause the music or to just pull off your headsets every time you need to talk to someone. This feature enables your headphones to pause automatically the instant you start speaking, and shall remain pause for about 20 secs and resume on their own if they do not detect any speech.

For better sound quality, the app detects the size and shape of your ear through these headphones. This enables the device to perform better with distinct users.

5. Motion Gestures: The right ear piece of the headphones has all the motion gestures such as taps for music pause/play, attend a call, play next/previous song and remove the headsets and the song pauses. These controls are highly helpful and can be easily learnt through the guide book provided, hence i won't dive deeper into it.

6. Number of devices that can be paired at once: These headphones provide an option of connecting two devices simultaneously. You can connect these headphones to almost every device that has a latest and updated version of bluetooth/NFC. Devices that i've paired them with are iPhone, macbook, hp laptop, and android phones.

7. What's in the box: The box comes with an impressive in-shape carrying case to carry these bad boys where ever you go. Also they include a C-type data cable for charging, 3.5mm jack cable which is quite long (haven't measured it honestly, but it is as long as a regular data cable), and a dual port 3.5mm jack converter, which so far i haven't tested.

8. Battery Life: Well i must say that i am quite impressed with the battery backup these headphones provide. This device completely charges within 3 hours and trust me with an ON/OFF mode of playing music regularly, the battery stays up till 4-5 days, which is i bet a highly impressive feature which probably no other company audio equipment in this range might have.

9. Voice Assist Functions: These headphones can be connected to google assistant, SIRI and alexa and perform really well.

10. Easy access keys: The headphones are enable with two easy access keys on the left earphone. The custom key toggles between the 3 modes that i've already mentioned above which are guided by the in-built assistant voice. The power key pressed long enough, turns ON/OFF the device and pressed once, the in-built assist provides you with the current % of the battery left.

11. Comfort: I should had talked about it earlier, but never mind. With no questions asked these headphones are highly comfortable, the cushion provided is the softest pad your ears can get. Since i am regular spectacle user, i find it hard with headphones imposing excessive pressure over the ears, making it a painful experience, but these headphones give a feather touch to your ears, even if you are specy or even while wearing a face mask. These go good with everything.

12. Battery Saver: These headphones tend to power-off on their own if not in use for more than a minute which is a highly power efficient feature added by Sony to the device.

Cons:

1. If you are into running or any sort of longer workouts, be prepared for sweaty ears. Since the cushions on these headphones completely cover you ears, creating a vacuum sort of environment, no air flows in and out, and the sweat starts dripping down from the earphones, which i must state doesn't affect them at all, only can be slightly irritating sometimes.

2. ANC can be difficult to be kept enabled every time since it reduces the environment sounds to almost negligible, which can be dangerous while running or walking at a buss street. Be very careful while using this feature. Probably it is made for environments such as while travelling in a bus or a flight, and seems suitable for these environments.

3. Since these headphones can be simultaneously be connected to two devices at once, which is a boon, but is also a slight problem in disguise. Imagine your headphones are connected with your laptop as well as you phone. You are attending an important zoom call while on your laptop and the headphones are in action, your phone starts to ring, now abruptly you'll start hearing you phones ringtone, and the device gets a little startled to which device shall be entertained. i've personally faced this, but i tend not to connect them to two devices at once.

PS: One highly important thing is, you won't get an experience of the sound through reading review or watching Youtube videos. You might get a fair image of weather to invest in them or not, but you'll only get the sound experience when you'll listen the music through these bad boys.; Audio Quality is great. These headphones sound amazing but the problem is they're tuned out of the box. It doesn't feel like they product neutral sound like many other headphones. But this is fine, you can always adjust the EQ, and Sony's tuning isn't bad (it'll satisfy most users).

Mic quality is pretty bad. I don't understand how such an expensive has poor mic quality. It sounds like a mic from a cheap TWS earbud. This headphone isn't for calls or meetings. The mic quality is only a part of the problem. It doesn't have a sidetone feature. You can't hear yourself talking while in a call. Trust me, you don't used to this (you shouldn't). It feels weird and in most cases, you'll end up talking louder than you should, just to satisfy your brain.

I use multi-point connectivity. I can keep the headphone connected to phone and PC at the same time. When I receive a call on a device, it automatically switches to that device. I wish the call experience on this headphone was better.

Battery life is great as expected. It lasts days for my usage. It lasts even longer when I turn off ANC.
It's also very comfortable to wear this headset.

I also like it that you can just fold the headset and place it on the table. It takes less space and doesn't need a stand. The carry case is also nice.

The cables Sony provides with the headset are really short. I don't know why a billion dollar company like Sony does this with their expensive product lineup.

One of the things I really liked about this headphones is that Sony's app doesn't require you to create an account and grant it permission to everything on the phone like some other brands. Connecting and configuring the headphone is also easy. The app has poor UX but it gets the job done. You probably don't need to visit the app very often.; Pros:
* Feels like a premium product, packaging and the provided carry pouch are perfect, aux cable is a plus, charging cable could have been longer
* Very comfortable to wear over workouts, etc.
* Connects instantly on my iPhone 13 after you turn on the product
* Bluetooth reach is good
* Sound is balanced with not too much overpowering bass... overall good enough for gym goers.
* Noise isolation is really great
* App for connection is simple enough and gives you customizing options...

Cons
* Build quality although decent still does not feel like a premium product costing 20k plus, a few metal bits here and there would have made it possible
* Not for true audiophiles.. more a competition of beats by dr dre

All in all, if you get a good deal during some festival go for it.. DO NOT BUY IT AT FULL PRICE!; J√° conhe√ßo os produtos da marca Sony e nunca me decepcionei. Gostei de muito da qualidade, conforto e do excepcional cancelamento de ru√≠do e apresenta√ß√£o do fone.; Estava com receio de comprar devido ao valor alto, por√©m assim que chegou o fone esse receio foi embora, isolamento de ruido impec√°vel, som de √≥tima qualidade, conforto incomparavel.
Se esta com medo de comprar e se arrepender tenho certeza que n√£o vai se arrepender, voc√™ sente ele sendo de boa qualidade, acabamento incrivel, cor linda. S√≥ tenho coisas boas para falar deste fone.
Chegou no prazo e bem embalado!; After buying the WF-10000XM4's and losing the case (replacement is $150. I paid $225 ish for the set), I thought I'd give the WH's a try. I got them for $228 or so, so opted to not get the XM5's due to the price difference. I've only had them for barely a week, but my initial thoughts are certainly positive.

Fit. Here's the deal, I have some big ears, with 3/4"" gauges. With my gauges in, I do get some pain in my neck. I have pain issues, so this was no surprise, nor is it a fault of the design. My ears fit fairly comfortably inside the cups to help lock out sound, minus the gauges. The polypropylene(?) material is quite soft and moldable, making wearing them for an hour or more easy and comfortable.

I have a kinda funny shaped head (IMO. But I'm highly critical of myself and the world), but these look really slick placed on my dome. I got black, because black goes with everything, and I don't wear color. Look and fit much better than cans I've owned in the past.

Noise cancelation. The ANC is good, but not great. I found the ANC on the WF's more thorough, which is a bit odd considering they're earbuds. However, they do form a more legit seal in the ear canal, so it could be that. There is some ""hissing"", but part of that is also my tinnitus. I find that there seems to be some slight hissing even with the ANC off. It's akin to being in a super silent room, and you hear the ""hissing"" from an AV system with it powered on, but with no sound. I've not flown with them yet (Which is a huge reason why I got these), but I assume they'll be just fine for passenger and engine noise.

Sound quality. So, I'm pre-burn in on the drivers. There is usually 100 hours or so of burn in on every new speaker/driver on the planet, and these are no different (I have not researched this in actuality. I was in AV for several years, and have some knowledge). But, so far, they sound very pleasant and accurate. I opted for an EQ setting (Excited) just to bring out certain details in the instrumental/electronic music I'm currently listening to. You can hear the trilling of the tongue on a flute, and the fingers against guitar strings. The detail is fairly rich, while maintaining a fairly neutral overall tone. The sounds seem to be reproduced fairly accurately and are fantastic for instrumenal music.

For the price I paid, these are great. However, for the normal asking price of around $350, I expect the soundstage and sound field to be superior to what it is. It is evident that you are hearing music played through 2 speakers often times, instead of an amalgamation of speakers 180 degrees in front of you, or listening to a live performance where the sound comes from everywhere. Think of this as 3D sound if you will, similar to Dolby Atmos. I understand they have the real 3d audio whatever, but right out of the box, they should be fully immersive.

Battery life/Bluetooth. Battery life seems to be ok with ANC on. I use ANC exclusively because I like to drown out reality while listening, especially during meditation. I suspect you could easily get 8 hours of consistent listening with ANC on before needing to recharge, which is plenty for half the flights on this side of the world (North America). What else can I say about battery life??

Bluetooth connectivity is very strong and nearly instant. I can walk from my apartment to my neighbors apartment with my phone in my apartment and still have unbroken connectivity. THAT is freakin awesome.

Overall, I'm very pleased with these cans, especially for the price I got them at. At the normal asking price, I'd recommend checking out the XM5's since their so similarly priced. If you're looking for a solid set of cans, and these are on sale, don't mess around, just buy them. You won't be disappointed.; Review completo como consumidor y profesional dedicado al audio, si te da flojera leer, de entrada te digo que esto vale cada centavo, no lo dudes ni esperes, rompe el cochinito porque te lo est√°s perdiendo.

Ahora si para los que dudan de Dios:

Hace 3 a√±os adquir√≠ los MDR-XB950N1, mejor conocidos como los Sony Extra Bass. Sin duda fueron una compra demasiado buena, pas√© de unos Skullcandy Hesh 2 a los Extra Bass y vaya que la diferencia es muy considerable.

Ahora, 3 a√±os despu√©s decid√≠ hacer un ""upgrade"", yo me dedico a la m√∫sica, soy estudiante de la materia y me dedico al audio, la verdad es que no puedo llevarme mis aud√≠fonos de estudio fuera de casa, necesitaba unos que realmente ofrecieran buena calidad, portabilidad y facilidad de uso con mis aplicaciones. Encontr√© estos despu√©s de hacer un par de b√∫squedas en internet, los compar√© con varias opciones y al final me decid√≠ por comprarlos.

En primera debo decir que he quedado impresionado por la tecnolog√≠a que traen estos aud√≠fonos. Puedes personalizar el audio acorde a tu oreja, as√≠ es, a la forma de tu oreja, Sony te pide que tomes un par de fotos para que se puedan analizar y proveer mejor experiencia, nunca en mi vida hab√≠a visto algo as√≠.
Desde que los abres se denota un producto bastante premium y que vale el dinero que se paga por √©l, ya que de hecho no es nada barato.

La experiencia de abrirlo es excelente, pero es cuando bajas la aplicaci√≥n que empiezas a ver lo brutal de estas m√°quinas. De adelanto estos aud√≠fonos ya vienen con carga m√°xima, o al menos as√≠ fue en mi caso, no te pide que los cargues ni nada, funcionan desde que los sacas de la caja. Son extremadamente c√≥modos y si eres miope como yo y usas fierros para ver, estos aud√≠fonos no te van a incomodar en ning√∫n momento.

No es que quiera advertir, sino m√°s bien dar aviso de que por defecto los aud√≠fonos se oyen un poco flojos, el sonido est√° un poco saturado, y si te gusta escuchar m√∫sica como el Heavy Metal o m√∫sica cl√°sica te quedas pasmado, no se oyen para nada como los Extra Bass que al salir de la caja otorgan un sonido fino y bien configurado. Estos no, pero entiendo por qu√© lo hacen, ya que como mencion√©, la experiencia de verdad comienza cuando bajas la aplicaci√≥n que tiene como mil opciones de configuraci√≥n y optimizaci√≥n de sonido, as√≠ que prep√°rate para estar ah√≠ unos 25 minutos de tu vida, que sin duda alguna por supuesto, lo valen.

Una vez que has pasado las optimizaciones, toca jugar con el ecualizador, yo recomiendo configuraci√≥n 400: 1 1K: 3 2.5K: 7 6.3K: 8 16K: 5 Clear Bass: +5 o +7 para escuchar Heavy Metal y m√∫sica cl√°sica, aunque si eres fan de los medios tal vez quieras mover un poco m√°s, pero como dije, esto es libre y Sony te prev√© todas las herramientas para que esto quede sabroso.

Ya con todo listo, toca escuchar m√∫sica, y ah√≠ es cuando te da el golpe. Sab√≠a que habr√≠a una diferencia entre los Extra Bass que tengo y los M4 que son estos, pero no sab√≠a que realmente se fuera a notar tanto. Estos no son aud√≠fonos, son interfaces de audio andantes, adem√°s, Sony te regala una prueba gratis en cualquier servicio de restringe que contenga su servicio Sony Audio 3D, yo escog√≠ Tidal, pero tambi√©n puedes escoger otros 3 m√°s, ah√≠ aparece la opci√≥n.

De verdad que escuchar m√∫sica en formato de alta calidad como es el FLAC que te ofrece Tidal es algo maravilloso, inclusive despu√©s de varios a√±os escuchando lo mismo, logr√© notar varios elementos musicales extras que antes ni sab√≠a que exist√≠an en la canci√≥n, ah√≠ es cuando te vas para atr√°s, es como por fin escuchar las cosas sin filtro. Tambi√©n recomiendo el formato ""Loss-less"" de Apple music en caso de que sean usuarios de iPhone o solo para que tengan una tercera opci√≥n. Sea cual sea el servicio que escojan, se oye incre√≠ble, pero sin duda combinado con formatos de baja compresi√≥n esto se vuelve m√≠stico.

Claro que esto no es tan plano como unos aud√≠fonos de estudio, pero sin duda la experiencia se acerca bastante.

En conclusi√≥n, estos aud√≠fonos realmente son un producto bastante premium, te otorgan no solo alta calidad de audio, sino una experiencia tecnol√≥gica muy innovadora, adem√°s vienen con su porta audi√≥fonos y cables correspondientes, son muy c√≥modos y portables. Los recomiendo al 100% no duden en adquirirlo para nada.; Super nice sound and comfortable to use. Long on battery. Can recommend"

For quality and features, they are worth the price!; I have used Sennheiser in the past, but I felt the loudness could have been better for this value. I'm not unsatisfied with the sound, its good but there is no wow factor this time as it is expected from this brand. Sound enhancement can be felt only between 80 to 100 level, software update can solve this. Lets hope the manufacturers hear this.; *Super value for money*

At first, I found the headphones to be a bit on the expensive side, but after experiencing their exceptional sound quality, comfort, and long battery life, my perception changed. They are a great option for music enthusiasts and frequent travelers seeking top-notch performance.; The hybrid ANC on these headphones is fantastic for blocking out background noise. Whether I'm on a noisy airplane or working in a busy coffee shop, these headphones let me focus on my music or calls. No more distractions, just pure audio bliss.; These headphones are the most comfortable I have ever worn. They fit perfectly around my ears, and the plush ear cups feel amazing even after hours of use. Unlike some over-ear headphones, these don't cause any pressure on my glasses either. Major win.; Not great sound. Connectivity issues.; I have owned several Bluetooth headphones, but the Sennheiser ACCENTUM is a whole new level. The sound quality is incredible - crisp highs, rich bass, and fantastic clarity. It blows away the muddy audio I experienced with my previous brand. Plus, the 50-hour battery life is perfect for long trips. No more scrambling for a charger.; It's been a few days since I started using this headphone, was using a Jabra Elite before this. The major issue with this headphone is that it randomly disconnects during Teams and Zoom calls, and then I need to scramble to get it to reconnect. Was not expecting this from a premium product.; Credo sia la sesta cuffia in molti anni, della marca Sennheiser, qualit√† eccelsa, la uso per la tv, ed √® ottima l'eliminazione dei rumori esterni.; Super casque audio avec une tr√®s bonne qualit√© de son accompagn√© de son EQ.

They are very comfortable even as a glasses wearer, and they get more cozy on your head over time. Battery length, volume and design is really great!
i recommend getting a cheap but sturdy case for easy transport.; Got these for my teenage son. First time spending a bit more as I usually buy headphones in the ¬£40-60 range but I was hoping these would last longer. The build quality is good and he is impressed by the sound and also functions in the app. Noise cancelling appears to be quite good as he conveniently cannot hear me when I ask him to do anything to help around the house, although the offer of a bacon sandwich seems to get through üòÇ. I am hoping that these will last him longer than a year as that is longest he has managed to have a pair from other brands previously without them snapping somewhere around the head band.
Will update if these break sooner than expected otherwise assume my son is happily listening to music, games and videos whilst ignoring me :)"

The build quality is much better than a lot of headphones even more expensive than these. These headphones are very comfortable and you can wear them for long duration. The music quality is great and it has decent transparency mode. The features are on point and the most useful feature is Wear Detection. Only con I faced is that they could have provided a hard case instead of a travel pouch. Other than that everything is great. If you're looking for a noise cancelling headphones around 10k, you should definitely check this out.; Absolutely superb quality! Bought from Amazon on sale, and it‚Äôs worth and more for the price. Super easy setup, and while the default audio setting isn‚Äôt great, the soundcore app allows endless possibilities regarding audio quality, with excellent preset options too. Very slightly on the bulky side, but that‚Äôs a small price to pay for the excellent noise cancellation feature. Battery life is also good, you get a solid 40 hours of playtime on just 2 hours of charging.

I‚Äôve been a fan of Anker for a few years now, and of all the Anker products I own, the Q30 is definitely top of the list!; I recently purchased these headphones as a replacement for my SONY, Skullcandy, and Sennheiser devices, and I must say, they are quite impressive.

Audio Quality - 4.5/5
The headphones offer an overall balanced sound. The bass is robust, and the high frequencies, while slightly louder than my preference, still deliver a clear sound. Cymbal sounds are notably prominent, occasionally to the point of being loud. Across various music genres such as Rock, Jazz, Pop, Indian Classical, and Bollywood, the headphones performed admirably, except for rock music, which I found a bit harsh. However, this can be fine-tuned through the SOUNDCORE app, which provides built-in EQ presets and the option to create custom presets. Overall, considering the price point, these headphones offer exceptional audio quality.

Design - 4/5
The headphones sport an eye-catching design. Their fit and finish are commendable, although the buttons feel a bit clunky. On the other hand, the touch sensor is highly sensitive and responsive. The black and gold combination, especially the logo, exudes a premium aesthetic.

Comfort - 4/5
In terms of comfort, these headphones shine. You can wear them all day without any discomfort. The memory foam cushions are thick and plush, providing a comfortable experience for extended use.

Battery - 4/5
The battery life is excellent. Out of the box, the battery had a decent charge and lasted for more than 15 hours. A full charge is expected to yield an impressive 35-40 hours with ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) activated.

Features - 3.5/5
ANC performs adequately, effectively reducing external noise, but it falls short of greatness. Call quality was initially subpar, with low volume, which improved after charging and resetting the headphones. Bluetooth connectivity is swift, thanks to the fast-connect feature, ensuring a seamless connection as soon as Bluetooth is activated.

Verdict
In conclusion, these headphones are a compelling choice at their price point. While they have a few minor quirks, their impressive audio quality, comfortable design, and long-lasting battery life make them a must-have. I highly recommend giving them a try!; Quality is good..as it is plastic made but quality of plastic is top notch and cushioning of ear pad seems to be very thin but believe it is very comfortable and soft ...... Sound signature is very good when noise cancellation is on..... Transparancy mode is ok aise type not great but overall good product from soundcore; I love these headphones for their sound quality and noise cancellation features. They deliver an amazing sound experience, with surround sound and supports high-resolution audio. The ANC is also very effective, blocking out most of the background noise and even the wind noise. The Soundcore app also offers many options to customize the sound and protect the ears by applying volume limits. The Bluetooth connectivity is flawless, with no lag or dropouts. However, the fit of the headphones is not great as well as not too bad. They do not stay on my head securely in all situations. For example, when I lie down on the bed, they tend to fall off easily.

Overall, I would recommend these headphones to anyone who values sound quality and noise cancellation.; Superb bass, excellent app support, really decent NC (manual as well as Adaptive)‚Ä¶ With my iphone and iPad (lossless audio) - absolutely divine hearing experience!!!; I tried it for a couple of days. Noise cancellation did not suit my ears, it gave me weird feeling of pressure on my ears, leading to headache. Do not buy for noise cancellation. Sound quality is decent. It is surely a hyped product. Warning - it doesn't come with return option. Buy at your own risk; With a little bit of tuning this headphones perform better than xm4, probably the best sounding Bluetooth headphones ever . Using Mr cows eq settings it's as good as an akgk361 wired while being an wireless headphones. However the delivery was pretty bad and I got this with a torn earcup, wish it came perfect; These headphones work well, given they are quite inexpensive. The noise cancellation is noticeable but not outstanding, but good given the compact size and low power used to drive the electronics. I did not expect the hard case that is included, and that is a plus if needed. The lead from the source to the phones is quite short but long enough to use, but I already have a 12' one, so having the short one does not affect my listening. They are comfortable. I have worn them for several hours at a time without complaint.; UNBOXING / PRODUCT - 9/10
Opening the box, I was impressed with packaging and initial impressions of quality. Headphones felt solid and of good quality materials. Connecting to a new device is very straightforward (press and hold power button for +3 seconds). Controls on the sides of the headphones make it easy to adjust volume quickly, as well as noise cancellation functionality. There is a nice touch where if you press and hold on the logo on the right-side headphone it will go into 'transparency' mode, which brings outside noise into the headphones. This is helpful if you're in noise cancellation mode and a coworker stops by to chat, you can quickly and easily duck in and out of noise cancellation. The headphones fold for travel. The kit includes a USB-C charging cable, aux cord and carrying case.

SOUND QUALITY - 9/10
So far the soundstage is broad, with clear highs and deep bass. Excellent!

COMFORT - 10/10
Ear pads are extremely soft, which makes them easy to wear for long periods. Adjustable band for different head sizes. Excellent comfort.

NOISE CANCELLATION - 7/10
This is the main reason I bought the Anker Soundcore Q30 headphones. I live in a townhouse and my neighbour with a shared wall has dogs that bark during the day - I needed a way to focus while working from home. While the NC does not completely eliminate the noise, it does reduce it significantly - I would say 60-70% reduction. I considered whether or not to just purchase construction-style noise blocking over the ear headphones, which promise up to a -38dB reduction, but they are often designed for extreme environments and would not be comfortable for a long period of time. If complete elimination of noise is required, you could purchase a more expensive pair of Bose Ultimate headphones. Or, use a pair of foam earplugs with these overtop and play white noise or music through the headphones with NC turned on.

If you go to rtings.com, you can objectively compare the noise cancellation performance of these Q30's with premium Bose and Sony headphones. Surprisingly, the performance is closer than you might expect for the price gap. Yes, the Bose in particular blocks more sound, especially in the higher frequencies. But the Q30's are still some of the best performing noise cancelling headphones for the < $100 market.

Within the app, you can choose from 3 noise cancelling 'modes'. These are not available unless you download the app, and customize the frequencies that are targeted by the NC.

1) Transport: Targets low-end frequencies like engine and road noise (default mode)
2) Indoor: Eliminates voices and mid-frequency noise (this is my preferred mode)
3) Outdoor: Reduces ambient sound on-the-go

Its worth noting that because these are large, over-the-ear headphones, just putting them on will cut some of the noise. Even before you start playing any music, you can just put these on your head and instantly cut like -20 dB or more from the ambient sound. You can also activate NC without playing sound, so if you want to just cut the noise, you can do that.

BATTERY LIFE
I'm still waiting to kill this battery. It lasts for days of casual use. I'm not sure if it will actually last for the claimed 40 hours, especially when using NC, but its certainly better than my wireless buds.

VALUE / CONCLUSION
Buyers looking for good quality NC headphones on a budget will be very pleased. Sure, a set of Bose or Sony headphones will outperform in ultimate noise cancellation and sound quality, but for the price these Soundcore Q30's are a great buy.; Needed to get some active noise canceling headphones for video meetings at work. After looking and reading reviewers at so many brands and models I finally decided to try these out. I've been a fan of other Anker products and these had good reviews and a good price. While my primary use was for video meetings at work, these are also great for listening to music and watching videos.

The active noise cancelation is amazing and works really well blocking out all background noise and significantly reduces noise of people talking nearby. The active noise cancelation has three modes: normal (which is like having the headphones on your head but not turned on), transparency mode (which allows you to hear what's going on around you), and noise cancelation. In this mode fans, AC, refrigerators, other noisy machines just disappear! Co-workers talking in nearby cubicles were significantly muted. I could sort of hear them enough to know they were talking but not enough to hear what they were saying. I tested the mic by making recordings and it too cancels out noise so the people on the other end of your video call also benefit from the noise cancelation.

The app allows you to customize the sound with built-in music types or you can use an equalizer to customize the sound to your preference. Music sounds excellent! Full range from low to high frequencies. It's not a subwoofer but there's plenty of bass.

These are very comfortable to wear. Sometimes I just put them on to reduce the amount of office noise so I can concentrate on what I'm working on. The padding is very soft around the ears and over the headband. Clamp pressure against the ears is fairly light. Perhaps too light if you're planning to do something very active so I would not recommend them for wearing while working out but they're fine for walking or light yard work or house work.

Like any full over the ear headphones they do get a bit warm after awhile but not as bad as other full over the ear headphones I've used in the past. My ears have not gotten sweaty after wearing them for an hour.

Like that the have a 3.5mm audio plug as backup for non-bluetooth devices or in case the battery dies but haven't need to use it as the battery life has been great and they charge up fast using a USB-C connector.

They can pair with two devices at once so that way my phone and my laptop are connected at the same time. I've not tested the range but have been able to walk around my 1200 sq ft single story house and stay connected to my laptop.

I am very pleased with these for the quality, comfort and the price!; Comprei esse fone em fevereiro, chegou um m√™s antes do prazo. Desde mar√ßo at√© agora, agosto, o fone n√£o apresentou nenhum desgaste (levando em conta que eu uso ele pelo menos 3-4 horas por dia, normal e as vezes suado): o couro est√° 100% e a bateria continua nova.

Em quest√£o da bateria, acho que, nesses 5 meses, se carreguei ele mais de 10 vezes seria muito. A bateria √© muito boa, ainda mais pq s√≥ uso com o cancelamento de ru√≠do ligado.

Em quest√£o de som n√£o posso opinar muito pois n√£o tenho muitas experi√™ncias boas, por√©m, diria que o √°udio √© muito bom, n√£o excelente, nem perfeito, mas muito bom (ainda mais levando em conta que √© 400 reais).

O fone √© confort√°vel, por√©m, com o tempo deixa a orelha ‚Äúabafada‚Äù, mas justific√°vel pois √© de couro. Uso √≥culos, dificilmente o fone incomoda.

√â o melhor fone para se comprar por esse pre√ßo.; For this price point these are hard to beat in terms of sound quality, durability, functions and form.

Decent product for the price. The product feels a little fragile but you can't expect more for this price. The bass is decent but not very controlled. The mids and lows are fine too.; Nice headphone that does the job of attending the calls and listening to music. Good quality at this price range.; The headphone quality is just about okay. For the price you get better headphones from different brands. Only good thing is it feels really comfortable on the ears.
Disappointed that it does not even have a microphone. Watch out for the product description. Even if it says microphone is supported, the piece received would not have any microphone.; I doubted the HEADPHONES reading the reviews.. But the product was at 1500 when I saw it in flipkart and Amazon for the first time. I knew that there will be some offers , and found the lightning deal of this product. I purchased it for 999 and the product was delivered the next day although I just ordered it in the night . The product is heavenly awesome and the sound bass is amazing. I SAY THIS IS THE BEST HEADPHONES BELOW 1200.; Previously, I used the Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB450AP, which was an excellent product from Sony at a similar price point. Naturally, I expected the Sony MDR-ZX310AP to have comparable build quality, sound quality, and size. However, I was shocked when I received the product.

The headphones are the size of a hairband. The speakers barely cover the ears, and the plastic used feels as cheap as that found in low-quality toys. Additionally, the wire is so thin that it resembles the use-and-throw earphones given out on airplanes.

I am absolutely dissatisfied with this purchase.; Earphones do good job in covering entire range. Looks good and is comfortable to wear.

Does not completely reduce external noise. Does not have bass effect.; Happy with performance. However, wire length is an issue."

Starting with the positives, the sound quality of these earbuds is quite good. The audio is clear and balanced, with decent bass. I enjoyed listening to music and watching videos with these earbuds, as they provided an immersive experience.

The battery life is another positive aspect of the boAt Airdopes Atom 81. The earbuds themselves can last for around 4-5 hours on a single charge, which is decent for their price range. The charging case also provides additional battery life, allowing for multiple charges on the go.

In terms of design, the earbuds are compact and lightweight, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods. They fit securely in my ears and didn't fall out during activities like jogging or workouts. The touch controls on the earbuds are also easy to use and responsive.

However, there are a few downsides to consider. Firstly, the connectivity of these earbuds can be a bit inconsistent. I experienced occasional dropouts and interruptions in the audio, especially when moving around or being in crowded areas. This can be frustrating at times.

Another drawback is the lack of noise cancellation or isolation. These earbuds do not provide any significant noise reduction, so external sounds can still be heard while using them. This can be a disadvantage for those who prefer a more immersive and isolated listening experience.

Additionally, the build quality of the charging case feels a bit flimsy. It doesn't have a premium feel and may not withstand rough handling or accidental drops.

Overall the boAt Airdopes Atom 81 True Wireless Earbuds are a decent option for those on a budget. They offer good sound quality, decent battery life, and a comfortable fit.

Sound enhancement can be felt only between 80 to 100 level, software update can solve this. Lets hope the manufacturers hear this.; *Super value for money*

At first, I found the headphones to be a bit on the expensive side, but after experiencing their exceptional sound quality, comfort, and long battery life, my perception changed.

They fit perfectly around my ears, and the plush ear cups feel amazing even after hours of use. Unlike some over-ear headphones, these don't cause any pressure on my glasses either. Major win.; Not great sound. Connectivity issues.; I have owned several Bluetooth headphones, but the Sennheiser ACCENTUM is a whole new level. The sound quality is incredible - crisp highs, rich bass, and fantastic clarity. It blows away the muddy audio I experienced with my previous brand. Plus, the 50-hour battery life is perfect for long trips. No more scrambling for a charger.; It's been a few days since I started using this headphone, was using a Jabra Elite before this. The major issue with this headphone is that it randomly disconnects during Teams and Zoom calls, and then I need to scramble to get it to reconnect. Was not expecting this from a premium product.; Credo sia la sesta cuffia in molti anni, della marca Sennheiser, qualit√† eccelsa, la uso per la tv, ed √® ottima l'eliminazione dei rumori esterni.; Super casque audio avec une tr√®s bonne qualit√© de son accompagn√© de son EQ.

El sonido bastante fiel y encuentro que los agudos y los graves estan muy bien equilibrados.; I love these and they are my first pair of noice cancellation headphones. They are very comfortable even as a glasses wearer, and they get more cozy on your head over time. Battery length, volume and design is really great!
i recommend getting a cheap but sturdy case for easy transport.; Got these for my teenage son. First time spending a bit more as I usually buy headphones in the ¬£40-60 range but I was hoping these would last longer. The build quality is good and he is impressed by the sound and also functions in the app. Noise cancelling appears to be quite good as he conveniently cannot hear me when I ask him to do anything to help around the house, although the offer of a bacon sandwich seems to get through üòÇ. I am hoping that these will last him longer than a year as that is longest he has managed to have a pair from other brands previously without them snapping somewhere around the head band.
Will update if these break sooner than expected otherwise assume my son is happily listening to music, games and videos whilst ignoring me :)"

Coming to Sennheiser CX 275s

I first verified its authentity on Sennheiser website before opening earphones.
It took a bit time to find the QR CODE because its at side of the plastic box.
The results were positive. My Sennheiser CX 275s was genuine (original Sennheiser product)

Sennheiser CX 275s
(Looks, comfort & build quality)

This earphones are light, handy and easy to use.
They look premium. Cables may look thin but they are strong enough. The earphones speakers are good looking and well designed.(looks very small though)
Using them for even 10 hours they are very comfortable. You dont feel any pain while wearing them for very long time.

Coming to Sennheiser CX 275s Sound quality

1st thing to know that u need very powerful output (device) to get the best out of them.
If u using them on normal smartphone with default music or video player they still will give you enough clarity and bass. But if you want dynamic sound and thumping bass u need some good music players.
(Pro tip) if your Android is rooted, for u the best music player is Viper4android fx. You can get the app from xda website.(only for rooted Android users, it cannot be used on non rooted device)
For non rooted device i would suggest poweramp, and maven music player available at play store.

Coming to its sound quality
Sennheiser cx 275s sounds crystal clear and opened. Bass is really good and deep. Many reviews say that this earphones are not for bassheads then let me tell you agian if you use good music players like I suggested you will get the deep and tumpig bass you want.
Soundstage is not so wide but not very narrow either.

Let's talk about mic & accecories

(What do u get inside the box)

(1). Earphones itself, two pairs of extra buds small and large, the earphone itself comes with medium sized buds on.

(2). The carrying pouch. Its nice and soft. You can keep ur earphones inside it easily. It has a thread lock that u need to pull from both sides.
It would be better if it had chain lock in it.(just a suggestion)

(3). There's a L shaped cable in side the box which you can connect with earphone's straight cable pin if you have very old device and the default pin not working for ur device.
You don't need that extra plugin if its connecting with the default straight pin to your device.

The inline mic

This earphones have really good quality microphone in line of the left earphone cable.
You don't need to hold the mic near your mouth while talking during a phone call. Its perfectly at its place.

Left and right guide.

The earphones L and R text is written in very small print right down to the speaker.
But you don't need to face that difficulty because fortunately the left side speaker's cable has the inline mic. Its that easy :)

About sound cancellation

If you plug in the earphones in it easily blocks every noise from outside world and lets you enjoy the Sennheiser signature sound. Just plug in and enjoy the detailed music.

Thanks for reading guys :)
Hope this review helps u all :); For those looking for a genuine review & a brief comparison summary between the best three earphones/headphones in the budget segment ...Let's help you to make-up your mind.

The review is for Sennheiser 275 S earphone but items for comparison are:

1.) Sennheiser HD 202 II over the ear headphone ,
2.) Sennheiser CX 275 S In earphone
3.) Sony MDR-XB50AP in ear Extra Bass earphones

Just for an introduction i would like to mention, I am a dire fan for flagship Electronic goods & manages to fulfill my passion for the ""Taste of quality"" from time to time.

Now let‚Äôs begin.. When you start looking for earphones or headphones, Sennheiser is definitely a brand worth to look for and rightly so, The brand has acquired a great reputation of producing some top notch quality gears in its segment .I too ,started my quest to purchase some of the best sounding earphones within reasonable limits of purchasing power & excluding those insanely pricey ones.

Read some very good reviews of the Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Over-Ear Headphone from my fellow amazonians and bought it.

Found it to be reasonably good but having certain drawbacks( may refer my review of HD202 at amazon) which were not upto my taste.
Next ,Unsettled , I went to purchase these Sennheiiser CX 275 S in earphones and here are my observations:

DESIGN & CONSTRUCTION :
√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó

a.) Looks & feels delicate to hold with its extremely thin wires and if you are casual in handling frequently, then in the long run,its sure to fail.
b.) Wires which are around 1.2 m in expanse are not tangle free and keep getting into random knots each time you get to use it.
c.) Comes with 3 different sized earpieces to snug fit different ear-anatomies and provides decent sound isolation but not the best.
d.) Inconvincing design of the earpiece globes as the bottom tail piece below the earpiece was not large enough to grip with fingers to comfortably fit or adjust the earpieces in the ears and each time you had to twist the spherical globes to snug fit.
e.) Comes with a gold plated L-shaped additional adapter for better fitment to laptops etc
f.) Comes with a small pouch , which for the most part was a useless accessory for me. A case or box would have been more a more elegant option. Squeezing the whole earphone into the li'll pouch everytime..naah !! feels primitive..! but then its my own two pieces.

SOUND QUALITY & PERFORMANCE:
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

The sound quality is crisp & clear , with clear mids and crisp pitches, bass was okayish but leaves you craving for more every time you plug it-in to watch some movie or NATGEO documentaries.

The lack of an adequate bass may even get unsettling sometimes.The frequency response as per specs was 17 to 23000 Hz against 4 to 24000 Hz of Sony MDR-XB50AP.
Just to quote Sony‚Äôs bass could get really deep & low with its 12mm drivers and neodymium magnets. For purists senneheiser does its job quite honestly but in general as for sony ‚ÄúA little make-up won‚Äôt Hurt ‚Äù LOL.

Sound quality is maintained till the maximum volume though it felt slightly that the mids succumbed to pitches at the apex.

VERDICT :
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

* Lack of a decent bass & extremely fragile design is unacceptable at a price range of 1600 bucks *
For me ""Not worth it"".

DETAILS & COMPARISON :
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

I happened to test the quality & performance of all the 3 renowned Sennheiser HD 202 II over the ear headphone, Sennheiser CX 275 S In earphone & lastly Sony MDR-XB50AP in ear Extra Bass earphones.

BASS :
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Sony>>Senn.HD 202 > Senn.CX 275S ,

The extra bass at sony may feel out of place at rare instances but never feels Cheap, redundant or unpleasant to the ears. It‚Äôs a quality refined timbre bass & not some low quality stuff. HD 202 bass was ok but then it had other issues with sound leaking from the pads and disturbing others.

SOUND QUALITY :
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Excellent on all 3 but Sony a bit appealing with its phenomenal immersive bass.

BUILD & DESIGN :
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Again Sony>>Senn.HD 202 > Senn.CX 275S .

Sony‚Äôs wire were tangle free, earphone pieces felt indestructible, noise isolation was ‚ÄúUltimate‚Äù.

Next was Senn.HD 202 and least by any standards was Senn.CX 275S.The fragile design of the wires around Mic. In senn.CX 275 may itself be a let alone discarding feature for many.

1.) Senn.HD 202 II might be good for gamers and watching from a distance with its long cord if leaking sound to outside world is not an issue.Bass is anytime better than Senn.CX 275 S but not as mesmerising as Sony.Sound quality though is very good,crisp and clear.

2.) Senn.CX 275 S might be good for purists but even with its balanced Highs and mids..Serious lack of bass keeps you longing for more ..especially if you are more into movies,games and documentaries than music.Moreover its extremely fragile & always tangling thin wires is a constant annoying feature.

3.) Sony MDR XB50AP gets the most evident and refined high quality deep bass with crisp high and quality mids.

Its indestructible unique design offers the best noise isolation of all and comes with the most sturdy tangle free wires.

**Do not consider higher bass as an adulteration to pure music.Its a quality bass with frequency response as low as 4 to 24000 Hz.adds a mesmerizing essence to the quality of sound which is absent on other two.Probably like a Super amoled with extra vivid colors that look more punchy & full of life.

Anyways at the end of the day its your call.

At such an affordable price, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much, but boy, was I pleasantly surprised.

Build Quality: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê The headset feels surprisingly sturdy. The materials used are better than expected, and it doesn‚Äôt creak or feel flimsy. The adjustable headband fits comfortably, and the ear cups have just the right amount of padding.

Sound Quality: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê While not mind-blowing, the sound quality is definitely a notch above what you‚Äôd expect from a budget headset. It won‚Äôt replace your high-end audiophile gear, but for everyday use, it‚Äôs more than satisfactory.

Comfort: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê The ear cushions are soft, and the clamping force is just right. No sore ears here!

Comparisons: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê I‚Äôve owned headsets from a tier above, and honestly, the ZEBRONICS Boom Wired Headphone holds its ground.

Final Verdict: If you‚Äôre on a tight budget but still want decent build quality and comfort, give the ZEBRONICS Boom Wired Headphone Over-Ear Headset a shot. You might be as pleasantly surprised as I was!; I didn't like the way it was packed. Sloppy way torn box wrap and bent inner headphones cover.

Well my review on this Zebronics headphones. Talking of build quality looks ok but a bit on the softer side it could show up damages as one uses it
Testing the output
I checked all parameters like the bass, treble,mid range sound highs and lows.
1.Bass check. I played Nothing else matters by Metallica. I was surprised it did sound great. The bass was good the lead guitar great drummer excellent,bass guitar perfect and rhythm guitar great.
2. Played Abba. ""Volez Vous"" Impressed again great output. The bass was fine, singing great too.
I will update my review after further testing this headphones.
Comfort factor
Not that good i would say. The ears do get caught up and one cannot wear the head set for a long time.
Noise cancellation.
Not really that effective.
It's a good headset to listen to your music. I haven't tested the calling feature which requires the inbuilt mic. Cable length just fine. It's a simple headset at a good price too. Though one cannot expect more juice out of it as compared to high end ones
One shot. Good for it.; One of the worst headset I have ever buy in 1 months it work fine but after that 1 month the mics was not working the noise was not coming good do Liberty is not good it is the one of the first headphone I have ever seen in my life I put not recommend anybody to buy this headset this is a one of the bus headset in my entire life and I am not going to buy Zebronics product again and when it is not working fine I try to claim warranty but there was no warranty; Very sleek and apt product, value for money and clear sound quality.; Sound quality is good and base is good. But cannot wear for more than 1 hour as it starts to cause pain in ear due to incorrect size. The speaker size is small for most ear sizes and so it does not fit properly causing discomfort.; The quality of the sound is good; The head phones have great bass and is very durable and good quality but it's is not comfortable for more than 15 mins the earmuffs are smaller than you expect.; Audio quality is okay.. but wire quality is not good.."

In low cost enjoy music very nice loud.......
I purchased it Rs 599/- only.; I got it for 799/- within 24 hrs. Using it for 10 days now, don't have much complaints. I will sum up in pros and cons after my experience with the earphones. Reducing 1 star for the first CON in my review below.
PROS:
1) Cheaper than some of the other earphone brands with 12 months warranty as well.
2) Good Audio quality, I found it was better sounding than an Over the Ears Headphones I have from Cosmic Byte (G4000). Clear sound and good audio reproduction.
3) Battery life serves good at least for my taste as I am not a heavy user (I generally use it 2hours a day max.). Just FYI, I have charged the earphones twice in 10 days.
4) Comfortable earphones with very less weight and good ear fit.
5) Mic quality for calls is decent, not much noise cancellation for background noise but whatever is sent through is very clear and accurate.
CONS:
1) Biggest con for me personally is that I can't watch online youtube or twitch videos with this one (usually have to go 360p or lower for smoother experience) as it hampers the wifi speed on my mobile when connected to the mobile via bluetooth. This is happening because my wifi router is 2.4Ghz and it is interferring with the bluetooth signal to reduce internet speeds. A simple 5Ghz router would solve this issue, but as I don't have it, its become an issue. Also, I can tell if you run videos from mobile internet then you don't face this issue.
2) Only SBC bluetooth audio format supported hence not the best audio quality.
3) Left and Right ear plugs always confuse me while wearing it on, also the length of left and right side is not exactly the same, slight mismatch is present, which goes to show poor quality checks from the company.
4) Battery life could have been better or atleast charge time should have been reduced. It takes 1.5 hrs charge time for 6-8hrs battery life.
5) Battery indicator is very wrongly calibrated. From 100 to 70% discharging, it takes 5-6 hrs playtime, while from 70 to 10% it takes just 30 odd minutes. This again shows poor quality checks from the company.; i am using this last 4 years still its doesn't have any problem in sound ,bass, backup anything. Go for it. I love it.; Good overall; High price but average quality not very good not very bad; Overall performance is good and value for money product; Battery backup okay sound is clear but need vibrations when incoming call; This neckband is good quality is impressive build quality is also good but eartips and cable is missing from box . They forget to pack them . Otherwise this neckband is 4 star

Edit . I found eartips and cable actually they got dropped when I open it but this is not of use tips are small and big and cable has no quality even it does work yes the cable is not working
. So I would say battery backup is good . Bass is also good but calling is very very good . I can't expect that this earphones speak full number when call came .. value for money go for it"

It offers a good backup battery. It sounds fantastic as well. Adaptable to fit different head sizes. The product is hybrid. Both wired and wireless connections are supported. If your battery runs out, you can use the wire to keep using it.
There is only one issue that I have observed, and that is sweating during the summer.; I have got the black color for me. Battery backup is too good and you can use with aux cable to reserve battery. Sound quality is okay but in higher volume, sound leaks and anyone near you can hear clearly. Noise cancellation is almost none, and call quality is ok(dual pairing is available so if you receive a call on phone and on your pc some video was playing it will get paused automatically , but the problem is call quality gets seriously degraded if you turn on the video - call will get garbled and you wouldn't be able to understand a single word of the person you are talking to. ear sponge quality is ok , you get one on head , and get ready to have sweaty ears in long session. Sponge can be connected again using thin spoon if they get open from the ear cup. Random disconnection is here and there and there is some minor delay - mind it if you are planning to use as gaming headphone , singleplayer is ok but not for multiplayer. biggest drawback is there is no system to fold the earcups. overall good budget headphone.; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition. Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad. It is not good for gaming. For gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.
Thank you for reading just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.; Sound quality and battery is very good.
Price is aslo good, but product is not durable for long time... Maybe product will not work after 12 month.; Sound great,price affordable,mic quality ok hai, connectivity quickly response karta hai, plastick body hai ok hai , comfortable hai per halka sweat aata hai near ear; I bought this product about 2.5 months back, My purpose of buying this headphone is to watch lectures, binge watching of movies I was wondering for budget friendly headphone under rupees 1,000.

So, After using this product for about 2.5 months and still using it. I would like to share the likes and dislikes of this product based on my usage.

Likes :
1) Sound quality is good and crisp great for listening lectures and watching movies and other content.
2) Battery life is also good it gives output of about 15 hours my daily usage is about 4-5 hours.
3) Bluetooth range is quite good for this budget.

Dislikes :
1) It's leather quality is very bad not satisfied with its quality to the leather was ripped out within just 2 months.
2) the plastic quality is not so good you can get scratches on its body easily.
3) it consumes more time to get charge it takes around 3-4 hours for 100% charging.
4) the glue used in this headphones cushion are not applied properly it comes out of the body within 1 month only.
5) the noise cancellation is not good you can easily hear outdoor activities sound Even at full volume.

Based on this budget it's a good product from Indian Brands Zebronics but comes with a lot of comprises.

If you really want quality good headphones atleast go for budget higher than rupees 2,500 or select other brands like sony, boat and other brands.; The quality is good and and sound was low because my right side not working and some small defective but product was good üëç; The product is good but they are faking too much by telling there's ENC and Gaming mode while there's no feature like that, it's just a normal Bluetooth headphone. However portability is good, comfort is good durability i would say cheap it can break easily also aux cable is not durable, sound quality good for this price range."

Liked the place where buttons configured on the left cup and looks premium. Grey and golden makes it classy. Audio jack included and connects well. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.
Thank you very much,

It produces dolby suround sound while watching movies feels like theatre exp..buildy quality is top notch..touch and feel is premium...office calls on Microsoft Teams are excellent without any issue despite not present in list of certified headphones...if you have budget for premium headphones then there is no brainer to go with this...You will never regret.; Just recently bought these and they blew my mind straight out of the box! If sound quality is what you're looking for, these are the ones for you! Build quality is another top feature here. They look and feel premium (compared to the Bose QC45, as i own them as well) and are very comfortable to wear. I personally like the touch controls on them because it's tough to press physical buttons always as they might displace the headphones each time you press them. Battery life is a whooping 60 hours (enough said, lol).
ANC is perfect for me as the ones on sony and bose always made my head dizzy. This depends from person to person but i like the ANC on these.
Only good things to say about this product. What a buy, i must say!; Pros:
1) Good sound (a little bass heavy - brand is known for it)
2) Good plastic quality
3) No connectivity issues
4) Touch controls are okay
5) Long battery life

Cons:
1) ANC is average. Not as good as XM5
2) Auto ear detection is a disaster (specially for small ears)
3) A bit uncomfortable if worn for long hours (ears fatigue faster)
4) Heavy
5) Ear cushions cause sweating

Overall, it will be only used to watch movies. For music I‚Äôll use IEM or airpods pro. I got the headphone for around 21k, so it‚Äôs good for the price.

If you like bass and want hi-res sound, then definitely buy this headphone. If you want a balanced sound output, then it is not for you.; Everything about these headphones is premium. From the case, to the accessories, to the product ofc.
Great noise cancellation. Great sound quality and amazing call quality. Microphones work like a charm.
The cushioning is soft and plushy. Touch controls could have been on the left hand side of the headphones too...but that's okay.
One problem, though - I was on a call, and it randomly said Mute On. This happens when you take the headphones off. If you put them back on again the mute will OFF. but I don't know why, in the middle of me speaking, it would decide to go on mute. :/
One of incident, just need to be a little mindful of it's fitting.; Got the Denim special edition.
Sound Quality: Excellent clarity and balanced sound
profile, with deep rumbling bass and detailed highs.
Comfort: Lightweight and
comfortable for long listening sessions, featuring plush ear cushions and an adjustable headband.
Noise Cancellation: Effective active noise cancellation that reduces ambient noise, enhancing the listening experience.
Battery Life: Impressive long-lasting battery, offering up to 60 hours of playtime on a single charge.
Design: Sleek and modern
aesthetic, though some may prefer the retro look of previous models.
‚Ä¢Features: Intuitive touch controls and customizable
sound through the Sennheiser app.
Price: On the higher end, but justified by the quality and features offered.; Im okay with quality of music and everything else but in terms of comfortable it is worst. I should have gone with Bose instead.; Sound quality is on another level compared to competing brand like sony and bose. I have tested QC45, New QC, QC ultras , NC 700 and XM5 , none of these headsets match the quality provided by sennheiser. The bass of these headphones are so good and tight. The base can be felt physically vibrating in the ears ( Not an exaggeration). The personalised eq settings can really make a huge difference based on your preference. The battery life is also out of the league. ANC is not as great as bose or xm5s, but still it is decent. For me personally it was my first time with an ANC headphones so it was good for me. The volume is lacking by little compared to the other ones but it is in no way less than adequate, at max volumes you never feel you want more volume.; I purchased this Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphone on 6th June 2024 after buy Sennheiser Accentum Plus and like its sound quality. I would say this headphone is Best in class of Best sounding headphone in market right now as compared to big brand like Sony & Bose. Yes, volume is very low and ANC is average and not compared with Sony & Bose in ANC performance.
It has been proved Sennheiser is Sennheiser and no other brand match a sound quality with Sennheiser in terms of best sound quality.; I was not a fan of the stylistic refresh from 3 to 4, but after buying a pair a see why they did it. These are very, very comfortable and have quite good anc. The sound may be a little too bassy for some but that is easily fixable with the fantastic app you can download. These have great mids and Treble that extends fairly far but never gets shouty or sibilant. The battery life is mind-blowing with anc, so if you're a traveler, etc. These should probably be your first choice. I love them! I prefer the sound of my Dali io-4, but for comfort and everything else these win by far.; -Sonido
Soy una persona que ama los bajos retumbantes, que te hagan temblar la cabeza pero que lo demas no brille por su ausencia, y wow! Los bajos de estos audifonos son como los de los Sony XM4 o incluso mayores, una bestialidad, en cuanto a medios y altos definitivamente son increibles, la separacion de instrumentos y sonido 10/10 (toma en cuenta que puedes usar un eq de 5 bandas y una opcion con aumento de bajos)

-ANC
He tenido la chance de usar la cancelacion de ruido de los airpods max, sony xm4 y bose qc y qc ultra, sin musica puesta estos audifonos almenos en ambientes no muy ruidosos no son los mejores, pero en cuanto pones musica no escucharas ni una alarma nuclear, tengo que probarlos en mas ambientes aun...

-Bateria
60 horas de bateria, no hay nada mas que decir...

-Comodidad
Las almohadillas acolchan las orejas y la cabeza de una manera agradable, pesaran 50 gramos mas que los xm5 o los qc ultra, pero no se sienten para nada pesados

-Material
Aunque es plastico, se siente bastante premium, el material de la diadema le da un aspecto premium, ademas del logo de sennheiser con un aspecto de plata

-App
Una app muy completa, con control de cancelacion de ruido, equalizador como mencione antes, que permite un cambio automatico dependiendo de el lugar en el que estes, cambio de codec y resolucion de audio (solo AAC en iphone)

-Estuche
Si tiene estuche (no como los Airpods Max) y es de un material solido, contiene cargador bastante largo, cable y un adaptador de avion, en general de un tama√±o bastante bueno, aunque not an peque√±o como los sony xm4 o bose qc y qc ultra

En conclusion, si los agarras en oferta a buen precio, no dudes en comprarlos si buscas unos audifonos premium y de calidad, totalmente satisfecho de la compra de la marca Sennheiser; Desligue o cancelamento de ru√≠do adapt√°vel e o barulho, de repente, invade sues ouvidos.

Outro recurso legal √© guardar o fone no caixa e o aparelho desliga sozinho na mesma hora!; Let me say upfront I am a long-time audiophile. I've been immersed in all things high-end audio for more than 40 years, and listened to a lot of stuff, including headphones. Until recently, I've avoided all BT/wireless headphones because they presented too much compromise for my tastes. Noise cancellation adversely effected audio quality and/or gave me a headache. Bluetooth simply didn't cut it for prolonged enjoyment because of the lower, compressed resolution and frequency.

But, that all changed in late 2022. On a whim, I tried the newish Sony WH-1000XM5 and was surprised at how good they sounded. The noise cancellation was excellent with little of the rushing elevator sound--and boy, the sound was terrific. For the first time I felt like using a wireless headphone wasn't a big step-down from wired. The M5's soundstage was truly impressive, rivaling my Focal Clear MG wired 'phones. Plus, the M5s were much lighter, more portable, and a bit more fun. The new Sony's were a magnitude better than the older Sonys, as well as anything wireless I'd heard before.

That got me wondering: If the Sony's are this good, maybe something by Bowers and Wilkins or Sennheiser would be even better. After all, Sony caters to the mass market, which is generally not that discerning when it comes to audio. Whereas, B&W and Sennheiser typically aim more for the smaller, high-end, audiophile market. So, I started comparing the MX5 to the new B&W Px7 S2 and new Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless.

Here's what I found:

In the past, like the Sonys, the B&Ws and Sennheiser wireless 'phones were disappointments, falling far short (for me) of their wired, non-NC counterparts. No longer, because the new models are dramatically better. Without going into lots of detail (something audiophiles love to do), both the Px7 S2 and the Momentum 4 are a leap forward in every way than their predecessors. Are they better than the MX5, yes, but not by much. As others have said, the MX5 has better software, better NC, is very portable, and pretty comfortable. For many, the slight compromise in audio quality may not be a big deal. I could easily live with the MX5. However, my priority is sound quality since I seldom use NC, and, even if the software of the B&Ws and Sennheisers is only acceptable.

Therefore, it came down to the Px7 S2 vs. Momentum 4 for me. The Px7 S2 is much nicer to look at, exuding high quality. The Momentum 4, not so much. In fact, they look like an MX5 knock-off with a few upscale touches. The software of both the Px7 S2 and Momentum 4 is mediocre at best, albeit functional.

Now about the sound. The Px7 S2 sound really, really good. Bass, Midrange, Treble are all top notch, if not perfect. They're fun to listen to, with a wide soundstage and energetic dynamics. That said, they're tuned to emphasize the lower frequencies a bit too much for my tastes. At first, this makes music and voices more vibrant and robust, but, over time, it gets tiring, and you're realize what you're hearing isn't all that accurate. If I hadn't listened to the Momentum 4s, I probably would have been quite happy with the Px7 S2.

But, I did listen to the Momentum 4. It edges out thePx7 S2 and MX5 with its overall excellent balance and accuracy. Nothing is exaggerated: voices, instruments, timbre, tone are all just right to my ears. Maybe not as exciting as the Px7 S2 upon first listen, but the Momentum 4s seduce you the more you use them. There's no need for lots of equalization, or fiddling to get the sound right; its all been done at the factory. Besides the accurate representation of voices and instruments, the Momentum 4s are monsters when it comes to soundstage. The placement of everything is wide, yet accurate. You can feel the space and air between different instruments, and where the singer is in the studio or stage. Layering and detail are pretty amazing considering these are bluetooth, closed-back 'phones. Sennheiser (Actually: Sonova, because Sennheiser sold their headphone division to this maker of hearing aids in 2021.) did their homework when it came to the Momentum 4. Plus, that 60 hours of battery life is icing on the cake.

Let me say this in conclusion. You won't go wrong with any of these three headphones. They're all great. I preferred the Momentum 4 because it represents the overall most satisfying package for the money, but you might prefer the Px7 S2, or the MX5, more. One last word, regarding the buggy software of the Momentum 4: I found none. With the latest updates, Sennheiser/Sonova seems have fixed the issues of poor connectivity and consistency. All system functions worked perfectly the entire time I've been using the Momentum 4s. Enjoy!; Excellente qualit√©, facile d'utilisation, convient pour tout type de musique."

I think Jabra need to release a fix so that it works when you use the boom arm. I have noticed muffled voice and cut outs while the boom is near mouth - could be due to noice cancelling mics but it definitely creates issues. So who have already purchased it's best to use it without the boom arm (by keeping it in its enclosure rather than bringing it near mouth).

Voy a comenzar aclarando que el pedido llego justo el d√≠a de hoy as√≠ que mis impresiones son muy tempranas, as√≠ que puede que me este dejando llevar un poco por la emoci√≥n.

La verdad es que estoy impresionado, en cuanto los sacas de su empaque el producto se ve de muy buena apariencia, algo ligeros pero nada que asuste. Las almohadillas son muy c√≥modas, el colch√≥n de la diadema es justo, no es incre√≠ble, pero es bastante c√≥modo, hay muchos productos de este precio que no tienen ni eso.
Los cables auxiliares que vienen con los aud√≠fonos son buenos, decentes al menos. Tambi√©n vienen con una bolsita para cargar los aud√≠fonos, que tampoco es la gran cosa, pero es un buen agregado.

En cuanto al sonido, la verdad es que son excelentes. No poseo aud√≠fonos de alta gama, pero si he probado varios aud√≠fonos en mi trabajo (Soy editor de video en un estudio de mi ciudad) y la verdad es que como primer impresi√≥n, no me parece que le pidan mucho a modelos como los Audio-Technica M20X.

Si bien no son aud√≠fonos que se recomiendan para producci√≥n o monitoreo de audio, sinceramente creo que tienen un poco de ambos mundos, la respuesta de audio parece ser lo suficientemente buena como para edici√≥n de video o audio sencilla, as√≠ como para uso de entretenimiento. Los bajos no son abrumadores como lo ser√≠an en unos Beats, hay muy buen espaciado entre los sonidos de la m√∫sica, la voz es clara y el aislamiento pasivo es muy bueno.

Veo porque muchos se ir√≠an por unos aud√≠fonos como los ath-m20x u otras opciones de la misma gama, pero la verdad es que creo que como aud√≠fonos de d√≠a a d√≠a me parecen mejor opci√≥n, m√°s c√≥modos e incluso m√°s lindos a la vista... Con el extra de que su respuesta es lo suficientemente buena como para trabajar de forma un poco m√°s profesional."

Its has got good noise cancelation, RGB lighting, Boom Mic of a very good quality.
Battery is very good, plus a bonus there is a mute button
When playing COD. the best part I felt, that when the enemy was approaching from behind, the headset gave me the exact feeling by making me hear like the footsteps are approaching from behind and back of my head felt it which I found amazing

The only con is the Bass is not that good, its mid level; one word worst to the core, firstly the fit to ear is extremely hard and pushing your ears with constant pressure

Cons :
1) bluetooth connectivity with pc games is useless as it gives reverb sounds while connecting to pc. and cant be played on pc with this pathetic sound. only aux works good. but when connecting aux, the lights, mic everything doesnt work.

2) sound quality is mediocre. the seperation for gaming is poor for pc gaming.

3) for listening to music for long hours is extremely painful and would be ok experience with music as it has music mode.

Pros :
1) only good for mobile gaming but still the fit is issue.
2) bluetooth to mobile works good as it has game mode and low latency.
3) aux can be connected to mobile too.
4) battery life is good.
5) build quality is good but design is pathetic to core.

overall verdict : dont buy at available cost even for 10 bucks also it is useless. as the pain it offers in ears is beyond bearable. features for pc wont work. so useless.

star rating : 0/5

Waste purchase.; Let me talk about the pros first.

-- Build Quality is superb, no one can tell these costed sub Rs 1500, They are better than many Rs 5000 headphone, some headphones stands are more expensive than these.
-- Tight on you head, not too comfortable but not too bad too, the advantage you get is a sound isolation due to the earcup, it is effective, if you are in a call and you are like me who get startled if suddenly your kids start loud music, they will reduce the effect.
-- Dedicated mic, it has a boom mic which has a reasonable surround sound isolation, even if there is loud noise on your side the other call side person will not perceive it as very distracting.
-- For Gamers it looks cool with RGB effects.
-- Mutli-pair options, I have connected it both my home and office laptop and it switch seamlessly, just make it more usable more easily.
-- Sound quality is surprisingly good, I have expensive Sony wx1000xm4, but has they don't have dedicated mic, I purchased this also, sound is good enough that you can use it has your normal music driver, with PC.

Now let's cover cons.

-- The first unit I got gone dead in 2 days, though I got replacement and took the one assist warranty also. Do not buy these without extended warranty, my unit gone bad in 2 days your unit can go bad in few days or may be never, but it is a real risk.
-- They are still tight on your head, prolong wear is going to be issue, for some.
-- Though mic provide sound isolation, but your voice does not sound natural, it is a still recognizable but there is a modulation you will feel, I think for most of the person it is going to be fine.
-- I will still mark them as casual PC headphones (as my PC is not my primary music machine). Its main purpose still remains watching videos and calls, for long music listening sessions I would still prefer my other headphones.
-- As they are big in size they are not very portable headphones, no case is given either."

These earbuds are perfect for feel the music and bass; Noise cancelling is not there; Battery draining fast than usual compared to other buds.; These are the basic version without the ANC feature so technically they won't show up on your Skullcandy app but now apparently Skullcandy made a app specially for low end models so they have similar settings and access via the app overall I didn't like the experience so I kept it but I hardly use it since the drivers are smaller with less output for bass and treble and sound; Bettery problem and qwality not good acording to price.
Build qwality not good; These are not of good quality. I would rather suggest you go for Samsung. These are really not worth the price.; A great voice quality and an international sound signature can be found in Smokin earbuds, which also have an affordable price.; The reason why I put rate 3 star is after almost a year sometimes the speakers are not functioning even both battery are 100% charged.

Sound Quality:
The sound quality of the Q20i is nothing short of exceptional. The headphones deliver a rich, balanced sound with crisp highs, deep lows, and a well-defined midrange. Whether I'm listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the audio reproduction is consistently impressive. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) feature effectively minimizes external noise, providing a more immersive and enjoyable listening experience.

ANC Performance:
The ANC on the Q20i works like a charm. It significantly reduces ambient noise, allowing me to focus on my music or conversations without any distractions. This feature has proven particularly useful during commutes and in noisy environments, making the Q20i a versatile companion for various settings.

Comfort and Design:
The comfort level of these headphones is outstanding. The memory foam ear cups provide a snug fit without causing discomfort, even during extended listening sessions. The adjustable headband ensures a secure and customizable fit. The sleek design and premium build quality add a touch of elegance, making these headphones not only functional but also stylish.

Battery Life:
The battery life of the Q20i is impressive, easily lasting through extended use. The convenience of quick charging is an added bonus, ensuring that I never have to wait too long to get back to enjoying my favorite tunes.

Versatility:
I appreciate the versatility of the Q20i. The headphones come with a durable carrying case, making them travel-friendly. The foldable design allows for easy storage, and the inclusion of an aux cable ensures that I can continue using them even when the battery runs out.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Anker Soundcore Q20i headphones are a fantastic investment for anyone seeking a high-quality audio experience. From the impressive sound quality and effective ANC to the comfortable design and long-lasting battery life, these headphones deliver on all fronts. I highly recommend the Q20i to fellow music enthusiasts and anyone in search of reliable, feature-packed headphones with excellent value for money.; Buy it for its sound quality for the given price point under normal mode operations. Build quality is very sturdy and solid. Almost at par with some premium price headphones. If you like customizing the sound settings to your own taste, this is the headphone which gives you sufficient flexibility to do so. The default sound quality may not be of the highest standards and is more leaning towards higher bass notes. still the high notes are visible enough to compensate for the over powering lows. With the equalization settings you can fine tune these short comings and achieve absolute thrilling and enjoyable music tune. Dynamic range is respectable and the sound stage is great, engulfing you into the rythm. It is very light and comfortable to wear, just remember under the hot and swearty condition please avoid as the area around the ear cups will start sweating and become uncomfortable. Battery back up is awesome. without noise cancellation and under medium volume you can squeeze more than 60 hours easily. I am not a big fan of transparency mode, but it has its uses, which i think should be activated when you start speaking or some else speaks to you. the continous on under Transparency mode lets all the noises in to your headphone through the mic, which spoils the musical experiance. The noise cancellation is OK, the is a visible difference in sound quality the moment it is activated. which deafeats the purpose of listening to a good music. It requires a lot more refinement through firmware updates. But i guess at this price point one cannot expect much on noise cancellation front. Overall a great value for money product from soundcore.; I recently bought this headphone, so this is an early review of my experience using it

Overall
Pros - 1. It is budget friendly
2. It has a very good noise cancelling
3. Premium feeling
4. Very less or no sound leakage at full volume
5. The Transparency, Normal and NC works quite well
6. Charges very fast, 5 min=4 hr and within 90mins full charge
7. Contains a Type-C and 3.5mm Aux cable
8. Contains metal+plastic extension
9. Very soft cushion(ear pads)
10. The head cushion is also very soft
11. Can be folded
12. Good clamping force so it doesn't easily falls off
13. The mics work very nice
14. Very good sound quality if you can set the EQ properly
15. Nice comfort
16. Ear pads are replaceable

Cons - 1. As the clamping force is strong so wearing it for hours without opening may give you headache
2. Not for rigorous use as the plastic body can get scratches
3. No cover/pouch is not given so probably buy a headphone cover to take it for travels
4. The buttons are not very tactile and feels a bit wiggly
5. The EQ is not good as you need to set it according to your preference and it is very time consuming...the base soundcore preference is very bad but according to me the acoustic and piano were very good.
6. The Type-C cable is not very long
7. Even if the head cushion is soft, don't get tricked by its real like feeling as it is not real leather
8. Wearing around your neck can give you this heavy weighted feeling but it is not a major con for this headphone
9. The buttons are literally clamped into one single side, just need to get used to the buttons position

Overall it is a very good budget friendly noise cancelling headphone which I always wanted, it gives a similar experience like the ones of jbl770 nc or Sony ch720n...maybe the sound quality maybe be not soo good like them but what more can you expect from a ‚Çπ4500 headphones. Headphones of this price range also doesn't gives a similar experience like the q20i. I hope you liked the overall review!; Se escuchan muy bien, la bater√≠a les dura mucho y son c√≥modos, 100000/10 üò≠üò≠üíñüíñ; I have been using these headphones for a couple weeks and they are a great value. Sound quality isn't premium like Bose for my podcast listening but listening to tunes has been enjoyable. Certainly the quality is good enough for the price point. These headphones rest comfortably on my ears and are easy to turn on/off. Battery life has been superb so far. I like that you can fold up 1 side so they store a little more compactly. Was reasonably straightforward to connect to my phone and PC without downloading the app. You can slightly hear the noise cancelling when sitting in a quiet room, though it's not bothersome, and when I wore these for a walk I was almost stunned by my neighbors who I couldn't hear walking behind me. So the noise cancelling works. I certainly would buy these again.; Super casque, rapport qualit√© prix imbattable. Une batterie infatigable et une qualit√© sonore bien au dessus de tout les casques dans m√™me tranche de prix.; Vraiment bluff√© par le tarif
Autonomie √©norme, qualit√© du son tr√®s correct
Port agr√©able apr√®s qq heures d √©coute
Foncer, Anker une valeur s√ªre; Ik sta eigenlijk versteld van de prijs / kwaliteits verhouding, de geluidskwaliteit is erg goed en de noise cancelling werkt heel fijn!
Bouwkwaliteit is redelijk, jammergenoeg geen berscherm tasje of iets inbegrepen maar voor deze prijs is dat geen ramp.
Een aanrader voor de muziekliefhebber die graag met stilte wilt genieten!"
Skullcandy Hesh ANC Bluetooth Wireless Over-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black),"8,999",https://www.amazon.in/Skullcandy-Cancellation-Wireless-Headphone-Technology/dp/B08G1ZBKGP/ref=sr_1_99?crid=2XVH1RLCU6S20&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Efk3iSeXQEQSeatvuV9h7gCVgngl9vqTe8wv9nQ0d0e-7IE-z1bOh1G15BquS0Y7Lxr0TjmGg2wP8jPy7FtYkah0rBk2UHV-TbJo9VrPYouD9twpVBDvQfRBJRH0R0Mbz0hy7Q108p2WHfQNw3kI7gw-eCPYzYdnSUq_rXNbKBgOrIBQ7O65cKaE0uNociHio-bU8J0w3IkuH8uZuJzYvYs0H5PRBW5fwPfQV7B87Vw.4d_4dI87WUDVEmneuflqU2Y8HED6362x7eyir8bMZRA&dib_tag=se&keywords=headphones&qid=1719169395&sprefix=headphones%2Caps%2C246&sr=8-99,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-R7tWdkqL._SY355_.jpg,"TIME-PROVEN SOUND QUALITY. With powerful 40mm drivers and exceptional acoustics, Hesh ANC features audio quality that has been refined over four generations of constant improvement. The clear, rich sound√¢combined with active noise canceling√¢delivers the kind of captivating audio experience that you√¢d expect for twice the price.; BATTERY TO LISTEN ON AND ON. We know: It√¢s hard to remember to plug in all the devices you have in your life. That√¢s why Hesh ANC features a long-lasting 22 hours of battery life. Plus, whenever you get low, the Rapid Charge feature gives you 3 hours of listening time on just a 10-minute charge.; MORE NOISE CANCELING, LESS FLEXING. Plenty of people drop a lot of coin to flex that they can afford noise-canceling headphones. Hesh ANC is for the rest of us. For those of us more concerned with sharing a great playlist than showing off our status. But don√¢t think you√¢re compromising: Hesh ANC delivers a 4-mic, digital active noise canceling experience that rivals anything out there.; AMBIENT MODE: YOUR BUTTON TO THE WORLD. Noise-canceling headphones are ideal for blocking out the world around you. But sometimes, you need to tune into your surroundings. That√¢s why we√¢ve designed Hesh ANC with Ambient Mode. Two quick presses of a button let you hear everything around you. Even have a conversation. When you√¢re done, just double press again to block out the noise.","Amazing product at a great price! First, the audio quality- uniquely detailed. Every instrument, voice, chorus and Synth effect can be clearly and individually discerned. It is nicely bass-oriented, which adds great depth to an already elaborate soundstage. Even then, if you want to reduce bass, use the Dolby Atmos Equalizer on your Android phone to tailor the sound exactly to your taste. Hence, the absence of app-controlled Equalizer is not missed at all. Clamping force is noticeable in the first few days but reduces thereafter. ANC is very good for day to day use with a slight chop-off at the base end, but that is anyway not noticeable in a noisy environment. The transparent mode is a BIG PLUS and you will use it much more than you expect. The light weight and great padding really helps, since long hours are guaranteed with this pair on. Buttons are sturdy and a bit hard to press, but the layout is intuitive and easy to adapt to. Sound quality over Bluetooth is actually better than that over the cable, which is mildly surprising. Battery life is very decent. You'll certainly need to buy a hardened carrying case, though, of you don't want to damage the equipment while travelling. Super thrilled with this product!!!; I've been using the product for past five days. Will write more in depth review later.

Sound quality:
Pretty decent. As a person who likes neutral sound signature, hearing this amount of bass is pleasant. It will rattle your head with ANC TURNED OFF. With ANC TURNED ON, bass is lil less but it didn't bottom out. More like natural sounding one. People with sensitive ear SHOULD GIVE THIS A CHANCE. Ambient mode is amazing and really useful when you want to be aware of your surroundings.
Packaging:
You don't get old cushiony pouch recently. Just a cloth bag with strings with Skullcandy logo on it.
You will get 2 inch charging cable C-type cable. We all have long C type cable for phones. So, this will not be an issue for the people already have the cables.
Packaging is indeed different from the release years. Skullcandy is always changing the packaging. Currently it looks similar to hesh evos.

What I disliked so far is that the extention slider in the headband is loose right out of the box. It slides easily. No tension at all. I don't know whether SKULLCANDY intentionally made it that way or defective one. I've used headphones before. They usually slide off this much only after the use of a few good months.; Physical overview:
1. Headphones made out of plastic. Really good build quality. Earcups have soft touch plastic on the outside.
2. Earcups have memory foam, which makes them more comfortable to use overtime.
3. Headband has sufficient padding as well.
4. Outside each earcup, there are two microphones (total 4) that are meant to pickup outside noise and cancel it out by supplying equal amounts of anti noise. The right earcup sports an additional microphone for calls, and does a terrific job in this regard. This microphone array/setup is identical to Sony's flagship over the ear/circumaural ANC headphones, the Sony WH-1000 XM4.
5. It sports a built in Tile‚Ñ¢ tracker as well.
6. It features a collapsible design for enhanced portability.
7. The right earcup features the control set as well.
8. The headbands extend to a comfortably large size. They extend from the upper joints.

Package contents:
Headphones, 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable, USB C to USB A charging cable, headphones carrying pouch, user manual and warranty card.

Pros:
1. Great sound signature, just like the Hesh 3 wireless.
2. Very comfortable to use over long periods of time.
3. Fantastic ANC at this price. Obviously it's not as dope as Sony WH-1000 XM4 or Bose NC700, but the difference isn't huge, it's noticeable but not huge. Do note that no matter what ANC headphones you buy, at whatever price, it won't block out everything around you, that's the reason why some people set unrealistic expectations with regards to ANC performance, and get disappointed when the product doesn't meet their expectations.
4. Battery life is amazing, as claimed by Skullcandy.
5. Robust build quality, with collapsible design.

Cons:
1. No multipoint connection.
2. No hard case provided.
3. Skullcandy app doesn't support this, so you won't get personal sound on this one.

Conclusion:
Just go for it if you're looking for high quality ANC headphones at not so high price.

P.S.- It's Made in China.; An honest review. I have used many headphones... But these are on next level. They sound perfect. They have an amazing microphone as well so no issues during calls too. The ambient mode and ANC is something very new for me but it is good.; I wanted headphones with excellent bass and good ANC.
After reading lot of reviews I boiled down to 3 options,

ANC Crusher (lot of reviews suggest they are very heavy , lot hiss sound, cabin pressure during ANC, Clamping)
Sony XB 900N (Almost want to buy this buy bluetooth 4.2 was a disappointment )
HESH ANC ( made a blunder choosing this)

Comfort:
SUCKS ,lot of clamping , I loosened it but still the clamping on the ears is still noticeable. I don't feel snug fit on these headphones, at least XM3 I tried from my friend were much better

Sound:
NOT FOR BASSHEAD. My 2000rs Sony earphones does much better and sound loud , bass is heavy, thumpy and I thoroughly enjoy those earphones than this 10K crappy headphones. Big disappointment because I expected bass heavy signature from Skullycandy that they are known for.
Sound is very low, I have maxed the volume and still the sound is not great, it has a ear piercing sounds screeching highs from left cup. I replaced this ear phone but not useful.

ANC:
NOT GREAT, subpar, below average. I am OK with this because for this price range you get this quality of ANC.

Customization:
NO EQ settings in the APP, so whatever stock settings you get you have do make do with them.; El sonido es de calidad, en ocasiones los bajos opacan la m√∫sica pero es ajustable a trav√©s del ecualizador de tu tel√©fono o aplicaci√≥n de m√∫sica. La funci√≥n de cancelaci√≥n de ruido hace bien su trabajo, en ocasiones demasiado bien as√≠ que evita usarlo en lugares donde requieras poner atenci√≥n; eso s√≠, la cancelaci√≥n de ruido reduce considerablemente la nitidez del sonido y adem√°s te genera una presi√≥n curiosa en los o√≠dos, aunque nada que sea inc√≥modo. En cuanto a la estructura y materiales, dir√≠a que se sienten bien construidos, no lo suficientemente resistentes pero est√°n solidos. Si tienes mucho cabello o muy largo, es fastidioso que las almohadillas halen del mismo, as√≠ que considera eso. En general son unos aud√≠fonos que compiten muy bien con aquellos de mayor precio, pero seg√∫n que circunstancias pueden llegar a ser poco pr√°cticos.; I have been with Skullcandy for a good 5 years, my last pair was the Hesh 3 and it was definitely time for an upgrade. These headphones are a lot more comfortable than the Hesh 3 and Hesh 2, as well as having better sound. I enjoy the added bass Skullcandy provides, but if you do not like or care about (extra) bass, these might not be for you.

They feel more sturdy than the previous models, and i like the addition of memory foam. They clamp to your head a little so they won‚Äôt move much when you do, but with prolonged use they can make the ears a bit sore depending on the size and shape of your own ears. I am a big fan of the simple, sleek look of Skullcandy headphones, especially in black.

The battery lasts a great amount of time, as well as the fast charging being great. The noise cancelling is definitely trippy! They do not cancel 100% of noise, but a good amount of it especially if you play your music loud. I am very happy with my purchase, especially because they arnet too expensive. Very fast shipping, too.; Producto de muy buena calidad el sonido y los bajos son sorprendentes; I'm in love with these headphones, I couldn't be happier, sound quality is amazing the, noise canceling is spot on and the base is monstrous, battery life is perfect, they fit perfectly as well and very easy to use, ohh and a little extra tip they're great for gaming as well, the sound quality is unmatched in my opinion.; Super casque. Confort. Adapt√© a tout appareil. A un super son

Thanks to rugged, innovative hinges that both fold flat and collapse, Hesh Evo easily goes wherever you go.; COMFORT FOR HOURS. With an ultralight headband and soft pads that fully surround your ears, Hesh Evo is one of the most comfortable headphones you√¢ll ever put on.; EASY, CONVENIENT CONTROLS. Simple, intuitive buttons let you take calls, adjust volume and change tracks without ever touching your phone.; DON√¢T WORRY, YOU√¢VE GOT TILE. Hesh Evo features built-in Tile finding technology. If you ever misplace your headphones, you can easily √¢ring√¢ them from the Tile App. So what might have seemed lost, is now quickly found.","So, this one is actually a 5 on 5 for me, for people looking for base, honestly, please look somewhere else, this is for the most balanced music listeners, there are a very few reviews for this headphone so I'll be honest, the sound is kinda on power with some of the best out there. How I know it? My roomate has the sony X3... The highs are awesome the lows are great, sometimes the mids get muddy, but it's a good investment not gonna lie. Where it really shines is the battery life and the fast charger...it has USB type C and that makes my life so much easier...if the battery runs out...you have chord to connect it with wire. Sound for a 8k headphone is top of the line...if it was even a little higher that that, I would have had some concerns but it's over all a cool one...Games felt a little laggy...no doubt there, but again...it's for very pleasing music heads...the sound is warm and nice...only problem I had was it's not that loud...idk why and also...the microphone doesn't work with the wired connection...this one was a bummer...
GG; If you're looking for a great sounding wireless headphone that will also be durable (unlike the cheaper brands) this is a great option.
The battery lasts really long in wireless mode, charges very quickly, and you can use AUX if you're out of juice for some reason. The headphone is comfortable to wear for long time periods, although your ears might get slightly sweaty. The headphones aren't heavy though, so you shouldn't experience discomfort.

Coming to sound quality, I'm not a big music aficionado but I found this had the right amount of bass and treble for me.
As for office calls, the audio is very clear, the Bluetooth range allows you to walk across the room without losing the signal, and the mic ensures your voice goes through despite any amount of background noise. As for noise cancelation, this has no active cancelation, but the thick padding on your ear lets you hear your music or office calls regardless of background noise.

Compared to the more expensive Bose or Sony options, this is a great value considering the price difference.; Sound quality is really good. If you are not going for anc, u can definitely give it a try.
Build quality is also good.
Only one drawback, there is no app support for this product.; The following are points I would like to point out after 10 days of usage. All points I have compared with my old Skullcandy Hesh2

1 Build quality has gone down from previous same price range headphone... I had Hesh 2 which I was using from 4 years... Excellent build for everyday use. Compared to Hesh 2 ,Evo's build quality is quite cheap.

2 . Ear pads not that comfortable.

3. Sound quality in beginning was not good. But after 10-15 hours of usage it really improved and opened up... And sound quality is good for this price range. 5 out of 5 stars for sound quality.

4 . This point I would like to point out to Amazon warehouse or storage , the storage and logistics of products dosent seems properly handled as package are arriving not that fresh or newly like. This has happened with all of my previous orders from last couple of years.

5 . There is no noise isolation fit I feel . Only 10% of noise is isolated... In previous on I had near to 50-60% noise isolated.

6 . Even with talking on calls using this headphone.. voice is not clearly heard on other end.. (This have happened with both telephonic and internet call both with excellent networks)

Conclusion .

I would like to give 3 out 5 Stars as overall.. the main drawback is built quality... I am not happy with Skullcandy hesh Evo generation compared with its previous generation headphone like hesh 2. They could improve build quality in this price range.... Sound quality is excellent for every day user for music..; Does not even fit around my head and when asked to return, you get wierd response from helpdesk.; Battery life is amazing, very comfortable. Many people say that bass is not good but i never felt that way..; Worth for the money; delivered on time and reliable. saved time exploring from shops during this pandemic times. so online purchase preferred.
sound quality - first class
background noise filter - perfect; - 2 years later and they still work perfectly
- Foldable design is perfect for fitting into backpacks or side bags (like the Uniqlo round mini shoulder bag)
- Battery life lasts long (I rarely have to charge it) and the 10-minute quick charge, which brings it up to around 40% charge, is a life-saver for when I forget to charge it
- Can be a little bit tight on the head/ears, comfortable for a couple hours then it starts to get slightly uncomfortable
- They're noise isolating, not noise cancelling- but it definitely dampens/muffles outside noise
- No ripping on any of the materials so far
- Noise quality is great, probably a bit more bass heavy
- Frequently goes on sale, def worth the price; Audifonos de una calidad excelente de audio, soy musico pero no me considero un audiofilo quisquilloso, es un audio bastante fiel, puedes distinguir cada detalle de la musica, no con la mejor calidad pero si no eres alguien exigente va a ser una experiencia bastante buena, un volumen si bien no es el mas alto que e probado es el volumen perfecto para disfrutar de la musica con detalle y sin que llegue a ser molesto, en cuanto a la estetica (algo a lo que yo le doy bastante importancia) son audifonos minimalistas y con un acabado en su estructura muy bueno, las almohadillas no tienen arrugas (algo que personalmente me encanta) y se sienten de buena calidad, adentro de los aud√≠fonos tienen tela, asi que espero eso ayude con el sudor y el calor, son almohadillas blandas pero no lo suficiente para que sean incomodas, su estructura es blanda, pero no endeble, es flexible pero r√≠gida
Y por √∫ltimo un buen tama√±o (compr√°ndolo con mi mano de 19cm de largo, desde el dedo medio hasta la base, y 14.5 de ancho, tomando desde el pulgar hasta la base del dedo me√±ique)

Actualizare la rese√±a conforme pase los meses

Actualizaci√≥n 16 de julio: Sigo muy conforme con los audifonos, ninguna queja. Algo que a algunas personas les puede molestar es que la musica o lo que estes escuchando, las personas lo pueden escuchar si estan lo suficientemente cerca o el ambiente esta algo callado, por ejemplo: Si estas en un carro y tienes los aud√≠fonos, tienen las ventanas cerradas, no hay musica y estan callados van a poder escuchar lo que tu escuchas, no tan ruidoso pero se puede escuchar, personalmente no me molesta, sigo muy contento

Actualizaci√≥n 18 de julio: No he cambiado de opini√≥n, sigo bastante contento con los aud√≠fonos, incluso son bastante buenos para el Gaming conectados por cable, algo que me sorprendi√≥ bastante es que incluso conectados por Bluethooth son bastante buenos para jugar. El √∫nico defecto es que muy pero muy muy de vez en cuando hacen un peque√±o ""click"". Esto ultimo solo lo termino de notar cuando no estoy escuchando nada, asi que realmente para mi no es algo molesto que afecte a la m√∫sica o dem√°s sonidos, sigo bastante contento

Actualizacion 2 de Diciembre:

Sigo bastante contento con los aud√≠fonos, definitivamente son demasiado buenos, no han tenido ning√∫n defecto desde entonces y ning√∫n rasgu√±o en las almohadillas, si bien hay mejores alternativas y con mas caracter√≠sticas, pero estos no decepcionan y no tienen nada que envidiarle a otros audifonos; Good quality product & good sound from headphones dispatch & delivery were good too. Only one small issue is, that they‚Äôre suppled with a tiny USB charger cable. Y ü§î but still happy with product though.; Le son est de tr√®s bonne qualit√© et bonne autonomie de charge.; Ottimo prodotto musica eccellente"

Fantastic battery backup and fits will on ears.
Excellent for workouts, running and cycling as it is sweat proof! Great! (I use it regularly for my jog and cycling.)
No problems whatsoever with my calls. Easy to connect and excellent BlueTooth connectivity.
Overall, Very good earphones and quality at an unbeatable price. Highly recommend the product, just go for it! you will not regret!; I got the to replace a set that stopped working recently. I'm sad to say that this style of headphones seems to have gone out of style, and have gotten somewhat hard to find, in favour of fully wireless earbuds. I appreciate having the wire, as it lets me hang them around my neck when I'm not using them. Anyway, I was really excited to find these from a reputable brand like Anker. And for the most part they live up to expectations, music and podcasts sound clear, the controls work well, and they fit my ears well. I like the little in-ear hook that keeps them in place, but they can also be removed if you don't.
However they are plagued by two shortcomings:
First it the battery life. I used these to listen to music and podcasts at work (medium volume) and brand new they often don't make it through a full work day. Basically they go the advertised 8 hours. My old discontinued pair definitely lasted longer, and they were at least a few years old when they stopped working. With these I'm stuck charging over lunch, or having them die near the end of the day. They also shut off when you charge them, so there is no option to listen and charge at the same time.
The final issue is that in 2024 they still have Micro USB B. They could be so much more useful with USB C!!!; March 2019
After 2 months of usage.

1. Lightweight- you can wear them around your neck without any problem.
2. Sound- they have decent sound compared to other earphones. The high, med, and low are balanced ok.
Overall sound is 8/10 for this range.
3. Water resistant- they can survive being submerged in water. I only tested for 30 minutes which is more than enough for me.
4. Battery : is ok
charges in about one hour.
Playback- at 100% volume- 7hrs15min (full charge to zero).

Range is good won't cause you to break connection.

Note -- For battery life - drain battery to zero and then fully charge every 15 days.

After 1 year usage... Feb 2020
Built like a tank.
Still running strong.
Even after using in rain, splashing, dropping them in the pool, they are still water resistant (charging cover is still tight and forms a protective seal to avoid water).

Battery life is now at 6 hours @full volume, which is great considering how much i have used them.
Charging port of the device is still intact and works perfectly (it still clicks in place and doesn't slip out like other earphones)

Great build quality.

Must buy.; Excellent sound quality.
Pairing is nice and fast.
Headset is easy to use with three buttons.
No issues with bluetooth connectivity.

These are definitely sweatproof as I have used them in the gym and I sweat a good amount. They continue to work well as they did when I first tried them. The battery life lasts for around 7-8 hours I used these buds for about four hours and afterward above 50% battery level.

Overall, good headphones.; Sound quality is good. But the material encasing the buttons is very fragile. The USB port cover broke off within days, and after some usage the switch button came off. Battery is just ok.; Soundcore is no doubt one of the best brands for music composers. It helps me figure out a lot of notes in my own music that I could have improved on, plus it has amazing noise cancellation quality.; Very Poor build quality, Buttons fell out within a month of use, and the earphones stopped working within 5 months of use.; Very good product at this price range. Good battery life.
Crystal clear voice.
The earbuds are a bit larger than I expected.
Overall I am happy with this product.; Son muy c√≥modos para hacer ejercicio y ligeros. Adem√°s tienen buen sonido y se pueden ajustar para q no los sientas; ** SLIGHT UPDATES FROM THE ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW AND IMPORTANT UPDATE AFTER THAT **

[August 22, 2018]

Pros: Pairing is easy and first impressions are overall positive regarding quality of sound. Earbuds stay in place and isolate a significant amount of ambient noise, allowing a good, clear and sharp sound. Comfortable inside ears too. Commands are easy to understand, but can be tricky to manipulate as they are located beside my neck, if not even on back of my head depending on how I wear the earphones. Cable is not in the way of arms or torso.

Cons: Having the cord hanging in my neck is not that so comfortable *for my taste*. There is always a bit of loose cord hanging and touching my skin or mangling with my collar. The cable clip that allows to reduce the length of the cord is a nice idea, but the cord pops out of that clip sometimes when I pull it too fast. Annoying. Alternative setup with two cable clips to avoid the bow tie loop on back of head is even less comfortable *for me*.

Weakness (See UPDATE BELOW after reading this): Microphone is quite bad. Sound is choppy and cavernous when wearing the earphones as expected (with control on the side of the neck). The sound is only decent if I remove one earbud and handle the mic with one hand, very close to my mouth, a position I personally despise. In other words, I *can* make a phone call with two free hands, but the other party will hear such a bad sound quality that they will ask me to call later, without the earphones. This is a big disappointment.

[September 15, 2018]

** IMPORTANT UPDATE **

As soon as I posted this review above, Anker customer service contacted me and (Emily) offered spontaneously to exchange the item for the Pro version, without me asking for it. I received the item without any delay. As a matter of fact, the mic of the Pro version is better, so the weakness that I wrote about is no longer there. There are slight differences with the Standard model (control buttons are not separated, miniusb port has no cap), but it is basically the same design altogether.

Unfortunately, the replacement model had another issue, the charge wouldn't hold. Without any hesitation, Emily from Anker sent at once *another* replacement model, again without me asking for it (In fact, I wanted to return the item in the first place, but she insisted to ""make things right"", so I agreed to receive another replacement). This time, everything is fine, all the pros and no weaknesses. I believe I was just unlucky the first times with non-optimal items and believe now that these earphones are quite good for the price. A reminder that I talk here about the *Pro* version.

I still have a slight *personal* dislike with the design and the cord hanging in back of my head or getting in the way of my collar (I have a small neck). but I am slowly getting used to it. Same with using controls, it now seems more natural. Overall, it's really a matter of personal taste on the design. You like it or not, and it's not an issue per se with the product. To be frank, I have never been fond of any type of earphones and I always prefer headsets. Yet this item is small, very practical and good, so I am overall satisfied.

I would have changed my initial rating of *3 stars* (""It's okay"") to *4 stars* (""I like it"") and not *5 stars* (""I love it"") because I objectively do not love the product because of my personal discomfort with earphones in generally, but I decided to re-rate at *5 stars* nevertheless become I FELT IN LOVE with the company in the process of having my initial disappointment fixed. Let me explain.

I've worked a few years as a consultant for the retail business. We used to do mystery client surveys and evaluation of customer relationship services of either small or big retail companies. So I know a bit on this issue. The golden principal of customer service is to quickly recover a disappointed or angry customer, and turn him into a happy one. Such turnover generally result in a very loyal customer, usually worth 10 times a standard one in terms of mouth-to-mouth positive appreciation.

Well, I wasn't angry at all with the first item and in my initial review, but Anker very PROACTIVELY, GENEROUSLY and very RAPIDLY turn me into a very happy one. I seldom saw such high degree of customer concern from a company and so many efforts to make things right. Really. I purchased other Anker products in the past which with I have always been very satisfied (cables, USB chargers and hubs mostly). But in this particular case, the efforts of Anker to nurture my confidence and appreciation in their brand is well above what I ordinarily see. Perhaps I'm still not in love with the product (and again, it's objectively only a matter of personal taste) but I am now in love with the company. From being a generally satisfied customer, I am now a very happy one toward the company itself. Therefore, my *five* stars. Good work Anker ! Thank you very much, Emily.

* DISCLAIMER *: Full transparency and ethics force me to say that in the process of this customer support, I did receive some unrequested personal gain from Anker in the form of a free upgrade to the Pro version and reimbursement of the original purchase. I do not feel, however, that my judgment has been altered in any way about the quality of customer support.; UPDATE 07/18/18: After my last update review of the SoundCore Spirit earphones, where I reported a serious problem with random, extremely loud screeching noise occurring without warning, I was contacted by Anker to resolve the problem. After providing them the details, they opted to send me a replacement set of earphones ‚Äì and they went above and beyond by upgrading the replacement to the SoundCore Spirit Pro. Within a few days I had the replacement earphones in hand and have been using them everyday. There are some differences between the Spirit and Spirit Pro models, some small and some large. The Pro‚Äôs controls are tactilely different, the battery takes longer to charge, and I‚Äôm not getting quite as good a ‚Äúseal‚Äù as I did with the Spirit model (I‚Äôm still fiddling with this so I‚Äôm anticipating the fit will improve as I tinker with the silicone ear tips). As compared to the Spirit, the Spirit Pro has a longer battery life, a nice balanced audio quality that sits just where I like it between treble and bass, and the Bluetooth range is simply phenomenal. The SoundCore Spirit Pro is one of the best wireless Bluetooth earphones I‚Äôve used, and although I received mine as a replacement, if I were buying again I get the Pro model. Let‚Äôs talk Anker customer service. In a word ‚Äì outstanding. In every respect, initial contact, responsiveness, follow-through, follow-up ‚Ä¶ just outstanding. For them to upgrade a replacement to a more capable model was above and beyond anything I was expecting. So, Anker SoundCore Spirit Pro earphones ‚Äì a well-designed, high quality, feature rich, acoustically pleasing product backed by outstanding customer service. Could you ask for anything more? (OK, they give ‚Äòem away free =8^) I‚Äôm very happy with my Anker products and recommend them highly. 2 Thumbs Up and 5 Stars!!

UPDATE 07/08/18: I originally rated this as one of the best products I've ever bought on Amazon and gave it 5 stars. After using them for several weeks a major flaw has surfaced and I'm forced to change my rating to 2 stars. The flaw? After I've worn these earphones for a couple of hours listening to podcasts or an audiobook on my iPhone, out of the blue without warning I hear an extremely loud screeching sound in both ears - so loud I have to jerk the earphones off. When this happens, not only is the sound deafening, the earphones disconnect from my iPhone. If I turn the earphones off and then back on and re-pair them with my iPhone I can listen for about another two hours before the process repeats. I really want to love these earphones, but having the pleasure experience of a podcast or audiobook rudely disrupted by an extremely loud screeching sound without warning just won't cut the muster. Thus, I must change my rating from 5 to 2 stars as these are not longer one of the most outstanding products I've ever bought on Amazon.

Original Review: I've been using these Anker earphones for about two weeks and they are flat out excellent in every respect. For the price these are hard to beat. Why? 8-hour battery life, very economical price, outstanding build quality, very comfortable fit, a neutral audio quality that is not too bass-heavy with highs that aren't ""tinny"" - just right, they produce good volume, and the Bluetooth range is incredible!. I've got a set of Bluetooth earphones by another manufacturer that I bought on Amazon, and they lack the range, the fit, and the battery life of these Anker earphones. I've listened to music of all genres, podcasts, audiobooks, TV programs, and more, and they all sound great. When I say the range on these earphones are incredible, I mean incredible. Most earphones like these have an effective range of maybe 25-30 feet before the signal drops out. With these Anker earphones I can leave my phone at one end of the house and go to the far opposite end of the house (at least 50 feet and maybe more) and the signal never fades, breaks up or drops. Incredible! With an 8-hour battery life I can work in the yard, garage, etc. virtually all day before the earphones stop working. This is very handy. I'd buy these again in a heartbeat. I've you're looking for a wireless Bluetooth earphone look no further ... these are what you want. This is one of the most outstanding products I've ever bought on Amazon, and if I could rate 'em 10 stars I would. 5 STARS!!!; Excellents √©couteurs, l√©gers et confortables √† porter pour plusieurs heures quotidiennement et pendant les s√©ances de sport, surtout avec les clips qui resserrent le c√¢ble et les ear-wings pour une meilleure tenue. L‚Äô√©tanch√©it√© est un avantage ind√©niable pour le sport mais je ne les ai pas encore essay√©s sous la pluie.

Les √©couteurs sont faciles √† utiliser, se connectent tr√®s vite √† mon t√©l√©phone et sans aucun probl√®me. La connexion est stable et je peux me d√©placer loin de mon t√©l√©phone sans d√©connexion.

Je suis impressionn√© par la finition haut de gamme en aluminium des √©couteurs ainsi que leurs accessoires comme la belle housse de rangement, les ear-wings et les ear-tips de bonne qualit√©. Les aimants int√©gr√©s dans les √©couteurs sont tr√®s utiles pour les attacher autour du cou lorsqu‚Äôon ne les utilise pas.

Le son est simplement formidable avec des basses puissantes.

J‚Äôai fait beaucoup d‚Äôappels avec ces √©couteurs et le micro est impeccable, on m‚Äôa confirm√© que ma voix est tr√®s claire.

Concernant l‚Äôautonomie, je ne sais pas s‚Äôils tiendraient vraiment jusqu‚Äô√† 8 heures car je ne les ai pas encore utilis√©s en continu pour des s√©ances de plus de 4 heures. En fait, je pr√©f√®re √©viter d‚Äô√©puiser totalement les batteries avant de les recharger afin de pr√©server leur dur√©e de vie.

En plus les √©couteurs b√©n√©ficient d‚Äôune garantie de 18 mois, et avec leur prix imbattable, ainsi que la tr√®s bonne r√©putation du service client de la marque Anker, je les trouve parfaits et les recommande vivement.; Auf der suche nach dem ersatz von meinen alten Kopfh√∂rer (√ºbrigens auch von Anker ) habe ich mich f√ºr die Spirit von Anker entschieden und bestellt. Am N√§chten tag waren die Kopfh√∂rer schon bei mir zuhause angekommen.

Super verpackt so wie man es eigentlich von Anker √ºblich kennt. Ich habe es nat√ºrlich sofort ausgepackt und gleich angemacht.
Was gleich ins Auge springt ist der Design von den Kopfh√∂rer. Richtig schickt und Modern. Ist nat√ºrlich Geschmack Sache aber meinen Geschmack trift es zu 100%. Die Kopfh√∂rer f√ºhlen sich auch sehr Qualitativ und Robust an. Und gleich bei ersten mal einsetzen f√ºhlen sich die Kopfh√∂rer sehr Bequem und Komfort an. Wenn ich jetzt mit meinen alten ""SoundBuds Sport von Anker"" vergleiche ist es nat√ºrlich wie Tag und Nacht. Die Gr√∂√üe und das Gewicht ist bei Spirit um einiges geringer und Komfortablerer. Was ziemlich gleich geblieben ist die Geschwindigkeit bei Bluetooth Kopplung. Habe es bei zwei Handys gestesten, einmal ist es der Honor 8 und Samsung Note 3, bei beiden Handys funktionier die Kopplung perfekt und ohne lange warte zeit. Angemacht und nach 4-6 sec. sind die Kopfh√∂rer gefunden worden und gekoppelt.

Und jetzt zu dem wichtigstem punkt was die Kopfh√∂rer angeht. Die Sound Qualit√§t ist zu 99% richtig getroffen meiner Meinung nach. Die EarTips dichten das Ohr sehr gut ab. Die verschieden Gr√∂√üen die √ºbrigens in den S / M / L / XL Ausf√ºhrung gleich dabei sind lassen keine Ohr Gr√∂√üe im stich. Da das Ohr so gut damit abgedichtet wird kommt der tiefer und kraftvoller Bass richtig gut r√ºber. Leider nicht bei allen Musik Richtungen passt der tiefer Bass ,aber da ich ein Hip-Hop und Rap Fan bin passt es perfekt. Nat√ºrlich habe ich auch andere Musik Richtungen ausprobiert , mir ist aufgefallen das es Geschmack und gewohnheiten Sache ist. Da ich eine lange zeit ganz normale InEar Kopfh√∂rer von Sony gehabt hat sich der Sound schon angewohnt. Aber nach ner zeit vergeht es und man geniest die Musik einfach nur.

Das Bedienelement wo man die 3 eingebauten Kn√∂pfe findet funktionier tadellos und reagiert auf Knopfdruck. Damit kann man m√ºhelos Anrufe annehmen, Auflegen, Musik lauter oder leiser machen, Play oder Pause und nat√ºrlich an und aus machen.

Li-ion Akku tut was er soll ,und die 8 Stunden Wiedergabe zeit tut er auf jeden fall erreichen. Nat√ºrlich h√§ngt es mit der Lautst√§rke und Musik aber mit durchschnittlicher Lautst√§rke die etwas √ºber die H√§lfte der Lautst√§rke geht ,bin ich immer auf 8-8,5 stunden gekommen. Die Ladezeit echt sehr kurz ist ,gerade mal eine stunde und der Akku ist wieder voll und Einsatz bereit.

Ich werde die Kopfh√∂rer bei sport und auf dem Fahrrad zu arbeit verwenden. Und ich kann jetzt schon sagen darauf freue ich mich schon rissig. Da die echt gut sitzen und nicht so einfach raus fahlen wie zum Beispiel die alten ""SoundBuds Sport von Anker"". Dann macht es doch wieder mehr Spa√ü bei Farad fahren mit Musik ohne die l√§stige ""raus gefalle aus dem Ohr"".

Insgesamt bin ich echt begeistert wie Anker sich bem√ºht das Kunde genau das bekommt was er auch wirklich will. Die Steigerung kann man sehr gut sehen. Die ersten ""SoundBuds Sport von Anker"" waren zwar gut aber nicht vollkommen ,da hat halt was gefehlt. Dann habe ich noch f√ºr die Freundin die ""SoundBuds Sport von Anker"" bestellt und dem unterschied sofort gemerkt. Und jetzt habe ich die besten die ich bis jetzt gehabt habe Bluetooth Kopfh√∂rer ""Soundcore Spirit von Anker"" ,und muss schon sagen Respekt !
Man merkt wohin Anker will und es klappt bis jetzt super.

Ich muss noch mal dem Support von Anker erw√§hnen. Wenn man irgendwas nicht verstanden hat oder nicht mit dem Produkt zufrieden ist oder einfach nur paar fragen hat. Anschreiben oder anrufen und man wird sehr freundlich behandelt und es wird immer versucht die bestm√∂gliche ,hilfreiche L√∂sung zu finden. und es dauert nicht tage oder Wochen lang ,es wird sehr schnell auf die Kunden reagiert.
Der beste Support dem ich bis jetzt erlebt habe! Weiter so!"

Sound and in cost. Just a bit too tight for head as head hurts if wear them for long. That‚Äôs all; I have been using these headphones from 5 to 6 months and they are pretty much good, they still are as new when I ordered them, These headphones do not have noise cancellation but the sound quality makes these headphones pretty much like noise cancellation, it's features are good and working very well, it's connectivity is also good, but one thing that is not good is it's comfortness it is not comfortable at all, If you wear them for nearly 30-60 mins, your ears will start paining..... It does not have latency in the sound, so it makes these headphones good for gaming, and watching movie.; The body of product is tough and rigid, but sound quality is also good according to price but give some unneccessary cut cut noise in between. The connectivity is very poor, literally took several minutes while connecting to my pc. The comfort is also very bad. Writing this review after using 4-5 months.; Good product at this Price Bracket.
- Sound quality is good but not great. I was using a Boat wired headphone with the same price & the quality of Boat is noticeably better.
- Bass is ok, no jarring and the treble is also not great but good enough.
- Build quality is good, even though it's made out of plastic material.
- I am using this for listening to music mostly and satisfied with the outcome.
- Battery back up is good.
- Bit tight while wearing during the first few days, but will get adjusted in the course of using.
- Overall, a decent product you can go for.
-Last but not the least- Amazon delivery was too prompt and giving all stars for their professional approach.; Nice product I love this and I customise this also very well; it is on ear type of Headphone , so it has less Noise cancellation ...

So It has no any Problem , it is best in price range (My POV).; Couldn't wear it for a long time.
Sound quality and battery life is nice but hurts ear after sometime.; The product is being falsely marketed as ""OVER"" the ear headphones but it's ON_the ear headphone...

The sound quality is still so pure, so is bass, connectivity, battery capacityüëåüèº
So Iam a daily user, I use it all the time, atleast 11-14 hours per day on average...(Iam really into music), you won't have my issues earlier!!!ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The battery life is still holding upüîãüí™üèº, I could use for 2 days with one full charge of 1-1.5 hour.
The cushion pads are also very comfyüò¥
The switches are still good as new...
Connecting two device at the same time was very useful for me.
Even though it has bad noise cancellation features!!ü•≤
Everything checks out,this is worth it......ü§ù
but the physically it might have some issuesüôÇ, the cushion pad skin have started to come off by 5th monthü§ï( which is normal for any headset, and I am a using it all the time),and now, by 7th month iam noticing small cracks over the top, bend plastic part, which iam assuming might break in weeks for good but it was worth it. Although I did hope it would last more than a yearü§ß.....the battery or the sound quality, everything's perfect, physical damage is what limits(which again is normal, considering my heavy usage); Honest review only. Based on sound Quality for the price.
1) Bass/Low frequency- Bass lovers this is for you. Amazing bass, clear and punchy, powerfull. No Forcefully Boomy bass like Boat. Hip hop, Pop music is enjoyable on these.
2) Vocals/ Mid frequency- I'd say that it's Good considering the price but not my the best, You could easily hear some podcast and interviews the vocal are clear but when a song is played and the vocals gets little overshadowed by Bass while playing bass heavy songs.
3) Trebble/ High frequency - I'd say it's Just above average. Here too bcoz of Bass the Trebble gets little only little overshadowed. but with Equilizer this can be balanced and you could hear them easily and is enjoyable.
4) Now comes Sound clarity, instrumental seperation and Sound stage/stereo.- Now even though it's just a 700 I say this works absolutely fine.
The Sound stage is Not very veryWide but just good you can here and feel If any type of sound effect is paning from left to right or vice versa.
The Instrument Seperation is Above average too but needed much More seperation . so does the clarity. No doubt all frequency Low, Mids,High are clear but Trebble needed to be more clear as the Bass is on the Higher side. But it all come down to the price. Yes as I know I am expecting too much for the Price. Bcoz I have heard much better quality sound in other headphones but they cost more than 2K. The Sound quality for the Price is Justified and Very Good.
5th Noise cancellation and Physical Appearance- this is A little bit of Over the earphone type design so my Large Ears gets Fully coverd and so someone with small ears boom this will Fit you well. And noise cancellation there is no Active noise cancellation but the Over the ear Type Makes it Passive voice cancelling Headphone and I have used it in Bus in heavy traffic with Loud Outside noise but then too I was able to here sound from headphone easily at 70% and it blocked outside Traffice horn and vehicle sound. So here it score too.
Blue tooth connectivity and range is is fast and good, button are tactile and good.
6th Gaming- Gaming you will get some latency but is playable for BGMi But the judging the enemy Foot steps is bit of task due to the Average Sound stage and instrumental seperation as well as Average Trebble.
Rest all is good and is A very Good Headphone.; Writing this review (cons.)after using for 15 days.
1. Sound on v. Call is very poor sometimes sound buffers, also sound gets cut frequently from the other side on call.
2. Not so comfortable for long hours.
3. Not for those who dive into music for hours.
4. I would like to give it a bare 1 star ‚≠ê for overall experience.
5. Just invest some extra into other headphones, not to regret later like I am.üòêüôÅ; Sound was good, product is nice, Quality is better then boat company; The plastic body cracked at the point the pivot joins the head cushion , it's not just me , but me 2 other friends have the same problem because we bought it together , all same , and there's a crack within 4 months , and ear cushion plastic is coming out , ofcourse the sound quality is really good , and very very very loud at its full volume , just hand it in your neck , and raise the volume , deafing sound; Headphone is good audio quality is good but quality of cusion in below average; Good Quality built & sound.; While the sound and battery performance is decent, the ear cushions are very flimsy and tears off in less then a month of average use.

Sound quality is great, super bass. Light weight and comfortable to wear for long. Very easy to handle and charge; Bluetooth connectivity is not that strong, while moving around in outdoors, but in indoors , its quite good. connection is stable. i am using in my desktop pc by using TP-Link USB Bluetooth Adapter, its works fine, no latency issue while watching YouTube. Only while gaming pc, sound via Bluetooth does not work, so i purchased 2male to 1 female headphone splitter cable and 3.5mm male to male aux cable to solve this issue. Only thing to to complain the soft cushion cover arround the ear is not that good quality, it will come out slowly very fast, even with deliciated use. Since its only 800 bucks, its hard to complain.; I recently tried out the pTron Studio Over-Ear Bluetooth headphones, and here's the lowdown, including the good and not-so-good:
1.The sound quality of these headphones is surprisingly impressive for the price. Crisp highs and deep bass make for an immersive audio experience
2.One of the standout features is the impressive battery life. With extended usage, these headphones keep the music playing for hours on end.
3.Bluetooth pairing is quick and hassle-free. I appreciate the ease with which these headphones connect to various devices, providing a seamless transition between my phone, tablet, and laptop.

Cons: Bad Build Quality:
1.Unfortunately, the build quality leaves much to be desired. The plastic construction feels flimsy, and there's a noticeable lack of durability. It's a trade-off for the budget-friendly price, but potential buyers should be aware of this drawback.
2.The plastic headband and hinges are particularly vulnerable, and users should exercise caution to avoid accidental damage

!!Final Thoughts!!
The pTron Studio Over-Ear Bluetooth headphones offer a solid audio experience and impressive battery life at an affordable price. However, the compromise on build quality is a significant drawback. If you can handle them with care, these headphones might be a suitable budget-friendly option.; So at the beginning when I got it it worked well and good, I was happy with the product.
Fast forward 3 months , the volume down button doesn't work anymore. The hinge which makes the pad go up and down became loose.
4 months later I accidently dropped it from knee level , the main 'on' switch completely broke ( i opened the headphones and fixed it later, ps i fixed it a few months after the review ) And since main switch broke I have been using it on aux the entire team since.
So battery life is like this - First month or two it worked just as said, around 11-12hrs, which was amazing, but then 4 to 5 months in battery starts degrading (like any other cheapish prdct) , it started lasting for a few hours only, maximum 5 hours.

batter life - 6.8/10
build - 6/10
sound - im not an expert at sound quality but as an average music fan this is good enough for me
8/10
value for money - 7/10 ( since aux is also there)

If you ask me , I feel it's worth it, for a cheap price I'm still able to use it with aux ( hi! this is future me editing the review, i fixed the button by myself , pretty easy to do it so i can use with bluetooth now).

ps : just recently i opened the headphones to fix the damn volume down button which broke, unfortunately it was broke inside out ( only the button ) and while trying to fix it i snapped a wire by mistake, so now the bluetooth turns on but all the slots arent aligned with the parts, like charging port and the charging insertion point are now misaligned due to my accident, and so is the aux port.

but still overall its pretty decent, i used it for quite a while , bought in Dec 2020 , i used for around 9-10 months.; Super uncomfortable fit with leather pads that heat up your ears. The earpads don't rotate and the material is very cheap that leaves stain on touch. The aux cable it came with was not only cheap looking, it also didn't connect in some positions since day one.
Sound quality is not well balanced. Mid and high is too low compared to bass which can make songs sound wrong, especially the mids being too low. Bass quality is alright. I have ptron boom headsets which are balanced better and was not expecting this. For being a bt/aux wireless headphone, usability for cheap is the one thing going for this compared to other headphones and it neither commits to that nor provide good sound quality. Would not recommend even as a cheap wireless.

EDIT: The product was disconnecting after exactly 10 minutes on idle with no playback. In those minutes, the headphone was also unable to differentiate connected/disconnected status. I replaced the product to get a CONSIDERABLY more comfortable product that came in a sealed box as opposed to last time. Both versions haven't failed to heat my ears with leather pads although the latest version is more comfortable in size. This product seems like some kind of scummy plan to clear out old and badly designed products. Not to mention I still experience that 10 minute bug occasionally, wouldn't be surprised if the firmware is designed to fail after a certain period too. I'm forced to return this product again. Absolutely don't buy and only if you are eligible for a refund with this product, just maybe."

I would like to share my experience: the sound quality is highly impressive, delivering clear and marvelous audio performance. Their comfortable fit and long battery life make them ideal for use over 2-3 days. The charging case is convenient to carry and is a great addition; it seems they're always ready to go...; Its is not getting charged. When i tried returning the product, it is not possible. We can only call the technician. The technician said like, i need to contact the service centre to replace the product. But when i checked, in chennai there is no service centre available.

Plus, the battery life is amazing ‚Äì I can get up to 20 hours of use on a single charge.; I have been using it for almost a month now. The product feels good but lacks upto date tech, it does not have ANC which is a big minus point. The build quality of charging case and earbuds are good. Sound quality could have been much better, voice notes are good but lacks good bass. Charging speed and battery capacity is great. Overall it's a good product but it has a room for a whole lot more.; Dont buy skullcandy product their customer service is worst. I have a reason to say this
I got defected product when i claim the warranty i submit my product to their service centre and its been 20 days then haven't replaced my product yet.
I recommend not to buy skullcandy product.
Even i dont know how much time they take to replace my product; The sound performance if these buds are commendable. Music, movie watching, podcasts and what not...
However, for calling purpose this would be an utter failure. Watch out before buying.
Also, Amazon return policy is really tricky. You cannot return if you are unsatisfied with your item. You can return only if defective or damaged.; I'm always skeptical of budget earbuds, but the Skullcandy Smokin Buds TWS have proven me wrong. They're incredibly affordable, but they don't skimp on quality.

It offers a good backup battery. It sounds fantastic as well. Adaptable to fit different head sizes. The product is hybrid. Both wired and wireless connections are supported. If your battery runs out, you can use the wire to keep using it.
There is only one issue that I have observed, and that is sweating during the summer.; I have got the black color for me. Battery backup is too good and you can use with aux cable to reserve battery. Sound quality is okay but in higher volume, sound leaks and anyone near you can hear clearly. Noise cancellation is almost none, and call quality is ok(dual pairing is available so if you receive a call on phone and on your pc some video was playing it will get paused automatically , but the problem is call quality gets seriously degraded if you turn on the video - call will get garbled and you wouldn't be able to understand a single word of the person you are talking to. ear sponge quality is ok , you get one on head , and get ready to have sweaty ears in long session. Sponge can be connected again using thin spoon if they get open from the ear cup. Random disconnection is here and there and there is some minor delay - mind it if you are planning to use as gaming headphone , singleplayer is ok but not for multiplayer. biggest drawback is there is no system to fold the earcups. overall good budget headphone.; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition. Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad. It is not good for gaming. For gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.
Thank you for reading just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.; Sound quality and battery is very good.
Price is aslo good, but product is not durable for long time... Maybe product will not work after 12 month.; Sound great,price affordable,mic quality ok hai, connectivity quickly response karta hai, plastick body hai ok hai , comfortable hai per halka sweat aata hai near ear; I bought this product about 2.5 months back, My purpose of buying this headphone is to watch lectures, binge watching of movies I was wondering for budget friendly headphone under rupees 1,000.

So, After using this product for about 2.5 months and still using it. I would like to share the likes and dislikes of this product based on my usage.

Likes :
1) Sound quality is good and crisp great for listening lectures and watching movies and other content.
2) Battery life is also good it gives output of about 15 hours my daily usage is about 4-5 hours.
3) Bluetooth range is quite good for this budget.

Dislikes :
1) It's leather quality is very bad not satisfied with its quality to the leather was ripped out within just 2 months.
2) the plastic quality is not so good you can get scratches on its body easily.
3) it consumes more time to get charge it takes around 3-4 hours for 100% charging.
4) the glue used in this headphones cushion are not applied properly it comes out of the body within 1 month only.
5) the noise cancellation is not good you can easily hear outdoor activities sound Even at full volume.

Based on this budget it's a good product from Indian Brands Zebronics but comes with a lot of comprises.

If you really want quality good headphones atleast go for budget higher than rupees 2,500 or select other brands like sony, boat and other brands.; The quality is good and and sound was low because my right side not working and some small defective but product was good üëç; The product is good but they are faking too much by telling there's ENC and Gaming mode while there's no feature like that, it's just a normal Bluetooth headphone. However portability is good, comfort is good durability i would say cheap it can break easily also aux cable is not durable, sound quality good for this price range."

Clearly Nirvana sounded way better to me and my daughter and more comfortable than the 20i.

Actually I was so impressed with it - sound quality, looks and comfort fit - that I wanted to have one for myself; but when ordering I ordered the 20i instead seeing all the fabulous reviews. Though the 20i is definitely a good product by itself - but between Nirvana and 20i - to the two of us, Nirvana wins almost all rounds - sound quality, comfort, looks and battery backup( this I am quoting from their claimed data).

Only one area though which I found 20i to be much better at was the call quality - I was simply surprised at the clarity. Nirvana has workable call quality - while 20i is great. This though was indoor call quality.

Overall we liked Nirvanaa way better than 20i.

In short if I have to buy another pair now at this price range, I will choose Nirvana over 20i.; Pros:
1. Beautiful sound quality
2. Crystal clear beats and bass
3. Good Battery life
4. Excellent multiple device connectivity

Cons
1. Cushion is decent like extremely soft, thus it feels weird
2. Plastic used is very cheap. It broke withing months.
3. Supplied cables are not long lasting.

Overall functionality is up to the mark, yet build quality is argumentative.; ; The sound quality is great but the build quality is worst.
In just 1 year decent use the plastic headband has broken in 3 different parts. I am using feviquick to keep it intact. If someone had used it roughly then cant imagine how early this would have been brojen.

Spending such an amount & getting such bad build quality has pushed me from buying Boat products from now.; 1st. Durability is too good
2nd. The sound is amazing and the bass is very heavy
3rd. And the ANC is amazing when you turn on the ANC mode the background noice will decreased by 75%
4th. The best Headphone at this budget you should definitely buy this Headphone.
> Thank you; Mic quality is not so good , have to speak loudly otherwise recever didn't listen and sound is good but not best in this price range . It feels little heavy. design is best in this price range and connectivity is good; 1. Sound stage is little base heavy
2. Mic is only usable on call if you are in a quiet room..AC,Fans/Cooler noise disrupt the call quality very much.It sounds like your voice is coming from far away.
3. It only charges via the type-c cable given in the box for some reasons.
4. Not for gaming-too much latency in Bluetooth mode. Use cable if you want to play.
5. Built quality is good but squeaking sound will be there when you wear it {sometimes}.
6. Noice cancellation is okay ..prevents static noice of cooler or AC from getting in but don't buy only for ANC.
7. No app support
8. Overall value of money product but not the best.; I bought it on 24th July 2023. Today 11th August 2023 still i didn't get any disappointment with this product.
While (BGMI)gaming It's difficult to find latency via Bluetooth connection. But wired connection is good for gaming.
No need of charge is required for wired connection. But Wired connection is not supporting ANC feature. Easily find the noise difference with ANC & Ambient & ANC off modes.
On ear it is very comfortable it covers Your ear fully. Also Feels Little bit weight & it causes neck pain at the beginning stage of usage but fews days later it's fine. Worthy product to adjust the pain.

Edited after 7 months of usage :
If you're crazy about gaming this wasn't good option. There is no latency issue that can be easily found. But enemy foot sounds are very important in games. This model is made for music. Not for gaming."

Tecture of the wire looks awesome.
Sound quality is average for the price range
No noise cancellation and thus cannot be used for office meeting usage.
Suitable for basic daily use; I was looking for earphones for daily use, mostly for taking calls. The ones with rubber tips become uncomfortable after extended use so wanted something without them.

Previously I was using earphones from JBL, this is definitely a step down compared to it, but of course, Boat is cheaper.

Here are some of my thoughts on the product:

‚Ä¢ Sound Quality: The sound quality of these earphones is above average, making them a great option for listening to music or taking phone calls. The bass is normal, which is neither too overpowering nor too underwhelming.

‚Ä¢ Noise Cancellation: One of the drawbacks of these earphones is that they do not have noise cancellation features. So, if you're someone who wants to block out external noise while listening to music, these might not be the best option for you.

‚Ä¢ Comfort: These earphones do not come with rubber tips, which makes them a great option for those who find rubber tips uncomfortable. They are easy to wear for extended periods without any discomfort.

‚Ä¢ Durability: These earphones are well-built and can withstand daily wear and tear. They also come with a tangle-free cord, which is a great convenience.

Overall, these wired earphones are a great option for those who want something simple, functional, and affordable for daily use. While they don't have noise cancellation features, the sound quality is above average, and they are comfortable to wear for extended periods. If you are on a budget, you can go for it.; This product worked for me like 6 months. These are good for office calls use. I don't recommend for daily use as they were somewhat delicate.; Dont use for too long, ears might pain due to odd design, i use the rubber tip ones, this is just plastic, base is too much and you will have to increase treble using equaliser, otherwise good product.
Friendly reminder, dont use any headphones on high volume, it feels good for short time but it will affect you in the long run. 30-50% volume is good.; Wire earphones, also known as wired earphones or headphones, are a popular choice for many people due to their affordability, reliability, and compatibility with various devices. Here are some key aspects to consider when evaluating wire earphones:

1. Sound Quality: The sound quality of wire earphones can vary depending on the brand and price range. Generally, they offer good audio performance with clear and balanced sound reproduction. Higher-end models may provide enhanced bass response and better overall audio fidelity.

2. Comfort and Fit: The comfort and fit of wire earphones are subjective and depend on individual preferences. Some earphone models come with different sizes of ear tips or additional accessories to ensure a secure and comfortable fit. It's important to find a pair that suits your ears well to minimize discomfort during extended use.

3. Durability: Wire earphones are generally more durable compared to their wireless counterparts since they don't have delicate electronic components like batteries or Bluetooth modules. However, the quality of materials used and build construction can still affect their longevity. Look for earphones with reinforced cables and sturdy connectors to ensure they can withstand daily wear and tear.

4. Noise Isolation: Some wire earphones offer passive noise isolation by creating a seal in the ear canal, blocking out external sounds. This can enhance your listening experience, especially in noisy environments. Keep in mind that the level of noise isolation can vary between models.

5. Connectivity: Wire earphones typically use a 3.5mm audio jack, making them compatible with a wide range of devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and audio players. However, it's important to check if your device still has a 3.5mm audio jack, as some newer smartphones have transitioned to wireless or USB-C audio connections.

When choosing wire earphones, it's recommended to read customer reviews, compare different models, and consider your personal preferences and budget.; The last time I used a boat earphone was in 2018. Those used to be good, but once the warranty ends, the right or left bud stops working. After 5 years, in 2023, I decided to give it another try, although I have a Bluetooth earphone.

1. Sound quality: It's great. Every type of music sounds better with these bassheads.

2. Noise Cancellation: Can be better, but being a canal phone, in this price range, you cannot expect much.

3. Call Quality: Overall, it's good for calls, but sometimes I have experienced voice distortion.

4. Handling: The wire doesn't get tangled, making the earphones great for listening at any time. I bought this neon colour edition.

*** Unfortunately, a week ago, someone stole the earphones from a cafe. So, now I am using QKZ MDR. Got it for ‚Çπ549. And truly speaking, MDR delivers a better experience than the Bassheads 102. However, the QKZ MDR costs ‚Çπ250 more."

(5 stars for sound / 4 stars for build quality)

AKG is an Austrian company, now owned by Harman International of the famous harman/kardon brand of hi-fi equipment and JBL.

If you're looking for a good pair of budget headphones for an Immersive listening experience, the K92 is perfect. They may not be the best looking ones, but the metal frame makes them quite sturdy, while most expensive brands are made completely of plastic.

I bought these headphones purely for listening to music via my computer. The ear cups of my previous (decent) AKG K52s had become scruffy so I wanted to change and after scouting several hi-fi audio websites, decided to upgrade to the K92 which had good recommendations as opposed to the K72.

The headphones deliver crisp, clear sound with no or minimal distortion (depending on your audio source or file). They have have a good audio frequency bandwidth (16 - 22000 Hz) which provides a wide dynamic range which means you get bold bass and clear treble. The low impedence of 32 ohms means that the headphones can be driven easily at low volume by a computer sound card without the need for an additional amplifier. A 40 mm driver delivers good bass which is not too punchy, but just right since these are studio monitoring headphones.

On the downside, I am already noticing slight wear on the earcups (which I believe are replaceable).

Overall, for the price, the AKG 92 is a steal. If you're into classical music, jazz, easy or popular music, I'd recommend these highly. Go for them without a doubt.

Pros:

* 40 mm driver delivers good low bass frequencies (not too punchy)

* Low impedence (32 ohms) gives clear sound at low volume

* Audio frequency bandwidth: 16 - 22000 Hz gives bold bass, good midtone and clear treble (very good for the price)

* Earcups fit well (tightly) over the ears providing passive noise cancelling (not active)

* Very enjoyable for classical music, jazz, popular and general listening

* Fairly decent build quality (metal frame as opposed to full plastic)

Cons:

* Earcups degrade after a year of use

* As with any over ear headphones, your ears become hot after prolonged use (should not be a problem in cold weather or an air-conditioned environment)

* None otherwise; i'm not an audiophile, or someone who makes/produces music, so i didn't buy these with the intent of using them as ""studio monitors"". i just needed a set of comfortable, over-ear 'phones primarily for home use (not commute) that both look and sound good and don't cost a lot. very casual, regular usage; no professional stuff. and for someone with similar requirements, i would definitely implore them to check these out.

i love the design. no complaints wrt the material used. incidentally, i was planning on buying the cheaper k52s because of their all black body, but i decided against it because i prefer the cushioning on this one. the look is great too. these are probably the only pair of headphones that don't make me look crazy.

the comfort is decent. lmao i actually forgot that these have no adjustable slider thing and instead have the self-adjusting headband, but either way, it feels okay. the earcups are huge and so would completely engulf anyone's ears. i'm 6', have a relatively large head and ears, so these were actually good for me. none of that sharp pain you get from on-ears.
caveat: when you wear these, if your ears are big, especially if they are more ""out"" (basically, protrude outward from your head in a more noticeable way), then they might touch the inside of the cans, which feels... weird, for sure. it doesn't cause like immense discomfort, but it's still weird and does cause some strain after a while because your ears are literally pressing against the inside of the cup. also, after a while, your ears might feel warm too. not hot, just slightly warm.

the cord is, yes, very long. again, not a problem for me because i'm not using these while commuting. and i don't think these are sweatproof, waterproof, foldable, etc., but then again they're not made to be used on public transit üíÄ the context of use matters. they're meant for the studio and yeah, since we're all holed up in our houses anyway, they're great for use inside the house too, granted all you do is just listen to music and chill.

the sound quality is not remarkable or anything, but it's good enough! you won't find me raving about these for ""how amazing they sound"", but they do sound very good, especially for the price. no complaints with the sound quality esp. given the price.
although, a comparable alternative would be the oneodio headphones that a lot of reviewers really like and i did also consider them, but (personally) their design was too tacky and too close to an on-ear pair which only means one thing for people with big ears: pain. but yeah, none of that ""extra bass"" bs that i absolutely detest. the music sounds clear and balanced.

caveat: i keep reaching for the wire to change the song constantly forgetting that this doesn't have button controls (or even a mic, but hey, can't complain too much) üò≠ if you're someone who does want these extra features, check out the oneodio pair for sure.
also, the noise cancellation on these is... not good, period. like ""i could hear my fan through these when i wasn't playing anything"" not good. it's not terrible, but it's just not there, really.

and okay, i know there's a whole conversation about studio/monitor headphones not being compatible with regular smartphones involving a lot of technical jargon (""impedance"", ""impedance matching"", etc.), but i don't think you'd have to worry about that stuffl with these. i use these with my redmi note 10 pro to listen to spotify, google podcasts, local music and also to watch videos/movies on youtube, netflix, prime video and i haven't encountered any issues! i believe they'd work just fine with any modern smartphone.

in all, these are a great pair and i would say i'm satisfied with my purchase!; No microphone, no bluetooth, no noise cancellation, no branding markup. Everything you pay is for sound and build quality.

Very lightweight, flexible and self adjusting. Extremely comfortable for extended use. Clean, balanced, high resolution sound. Suitable for all kinds of audio.

Only note, you need a good port to get the most out of it. Works great on my computer. But when I plug it into my ps5 controller, it's fine. But not very loud.; The headphone is lightweight. It is over-the-ear, and my ear completely goes inside the cup. It does not press my ears, so it is very comfortable. The sound quality is awesome. The bass is very well balanced. You can hear every low pitch and high pitch, as well as every instrument in the music, very clearly. I use this to compose music in FL Studio. It is a nice headphone for gaming too. The cable is 3 meters long. I recommend this headphone for everyone, and for this price, it is a good deal.; I had two pairs of AKG240's in the past and several other brands since. All between $100 and $200 a set. These cans sound as good or better. Very defined. Good response! A little lacking in bass (hence the 4 rating) but they make up for it in overall definition and uncoloured sound. I hope to enjoy these for years to come. Great product!; Fone de √≥tima qualidade, muito confort√°vel. Voce pode ficar horas com o fone e nem percebe que est√° com o fone. O que eu achei ruim √© que o fone vem com um cabo grande (3 metros). √â muito cabo.; Excelente rango de respuesta audible, sin ser un equipo extra potente o extra bass, permite trabajar audio en sala, estudio o reproducir c√≥modamente m√∫sica para disfrute. Excelente desempe√±o con audio 3D-7D; Como en la caja te marca son para estudio son muy confortables te tapan toda la oreja el material es de muy buena calidad menos el cable es como los de iPhone buena calidad pero muy delicados y se escuchan muy bien; These are the best closed back headphones I've run across for the money with good bass, smooth sound throughout the range,and no particular coloration above the bass to the highs. The only two drawbacks would be that for closed back headphones, the isolation isn't the best, especially for smaller heads, and the overall sound character isn't as airy and open sounding with that almost laser imaging that can be achieved with the open backs, which would be at least twice the cost for those for such tonal balance as these. Sensitivity is also decent and not hard to drive with various headphone amps."

Providing good++ value for good enough price.; I recently purchased this headphone and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is truly remarkable, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience that brings my music and podcasts to life. Whether I'm jamming to my favorite tunes or engrossed in a podcast, the clarity and depth of the sound are truly impressive.

One of the standout features for me is the microphone's noise cancellation capabilities. While it may not completely eliminate all background noise, it does a commendable job of reducing ambient sounds during calls. The result is clear and crisp communication without the distractions of external noise. It's perfect for virtual meetings and online gaming sessions where effective communication is key.

The design of the headphone is sleek and comfortable, making it suitable for extended wear. The over-ear cups provide a snug fit without causing discomfort, and the adjustable headband ensures a customized and secure fit. The build quality also feels robust, indicating durability for everyday use.

I appreciate the user-friendly controls that allow me to adjust volume, skip tracks, and manage calls effortlessly. The Bluetooth connectivity is reliable, providing a stable connection with my devices without any noticeable lag.

Overall, this headphone is a solid choice for anyone seeking a combination of excellent sound quality and decent noise cancellation. It strikes a great balance between performance and affordability, making it a valuable addition to my audio gear. Highly recommended!; Bought for like 6.8K during the Republic Day sale. Worth every penny you pay for. Used these for a week and here's the experience:

Pros:
1) Beautiful quality bass despite the price point.

2) Sony is just Sony, sound quality is 100% even at the highest of volumes.

3) Insane battery life, even with the ANC on.

4) Super light-weight (approx 190g) and extremely comfy foam pads. Easily can listen for hours together.

5) Figuring it out how to connect took me a few minutes, but after that no issues at all. Just instant Bluetooth connection with any device.

The only con:
1) ANC is kinda poor, and it's understandable cause they have to differentiate the XB910N from the CH720N. So it doesn't really affect my rating.

Bottom-line, if you're looking a pair of excellent headphones below 10K just go for these. You can't wrong with a pair of Sony headphones.; Title: Exceptional Performance, but No Carry Case Included

‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Having recently acquired the Sony WH-CH720N headphones, I've been thoroughly impressed with their overall performance. The noise-canceling feature is effective in creating a peaceful listening experience, whether I'm on the go or immersed in a noisy environment.

The sound quality is top-notch, offering a well-balanced and rich audio profile. The bass is impactful without overshadowing the mids and highs, ensuring an immersive and enjoyable listening experience. The wireless connectivity is convenient, and the battery life easily meets the demands of long flights and extended usage.

Comfort is a priority for me, and the WH-CH720N excels in this aspect. The plush ear cushions and adjustable headband make these headphones comfortable for prolonged use. I've worn them for hours without any discomfort, making them ideal for extended work or entertainment sessions.

The touch controls on the ear cups are intuitive and responsive, allowing for seamless navigation through tracks and volume adjustment. The built-in microphone delivers clear voice quality during calls, adding to the overall versatility of these headphones.

One notable downside, however, is the absence of a carry case in the package. While the headphones themselves are durable, a dedicated case would have been appreciated for added protection during travel and storage.

In summary, the Sony WH-CH720N headphones offer an exceptional blend of performance, comfort, and convenience. Despite the lack of a carry case, they remain a solid choice for those seeking reliable wireless headphones with effective noise cancelation.; Bom cancelamento de ru√≠do e fone leve para usar por bastante horas; I recently invested in the Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations on multiple fronts. As an avid music lover and someone who appreciates a good pair of headphones, these have quickly become my go-to choice for a premium audio experience.

1. Comfortable Ear Coverage:

One of the standout features of these headphones is the generous size of the ear cups. They provide excellent coverage, enveloping my entire ears in a cocoon of sound. The over-ear design not only enhances comfort during long listening sessions but also effectively isolates ambient noise, allowing me to immerse myself completely in the music.

2. Superior Noise Cancelling:

The noise-cancelling technology on the WH-CH720N is simply outstanding. Whether I'm on a noisy commute or working in a bustling cafe, the headphones create a tranquil listening environment by effectively blocking out external disturbances. The adaptive nature of the noise cancellation ensures a seamless transition between different environments, providing a truly immersive experience.

3. Impressive Battery Life:

Battery life is a crucial factor for any wireless headphone user, and Sony has delivered in this department. The WH-CH720N boasts an impressive battery life, providing hours of uninterrupted music playback on a single charge. This is perfect for long flights, road trips, or simply when you don't want to worry about constantly recharging your headphones.

4. Seamless Wireless Connectivity:

Setting up the wireless connection was a breeze, thanks to the seamless Bluetooth pairing. The headphones quickly connect to my two devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance. The freedom of movement that wireless functionality offers adds to the overall convenience of these headphones.

5. Crisp Sound Quality:

Of course, none of these features would matter if the sound quality wasn't top-notch. Fortunately, the WH-CH720N delivers crisp and clear audio across various genres. The bass is punchy without being overwhelming, and the mids and highs are well-balanced, providing a rich and detailed listening experience.

6. Enhanced Experience with the Headphones App:

What sets the WH-CH720N apart is the fantastic user experience provided by the Headphones app. The app allows for easy customization of sound settings, enabling me to tailor the audio profile to my liking. Additionally, firmware updates and additional features are seamlessly delivered through the app, ensuring that my headphones stay current and optimized for the best performance.

In conclusion, the Sony WH-CH720N Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones have proven to be an excellent investment. The combination of comfort, noise cancellation, battery life, connectivity, and sound quality makes them a standout choice in the crowded market of wireless headphones. If you're in the market for a reliable and immersive audio experience, these headphones are definitely worth considering.; I have spent years fighting to find a decent pair of bluetooth headphones since no phone manufacturer wants to make a decent phone with a jack anymore (which is endlessly stupid, but I digress). I have tried everything form fancy expensive Galaxy Buds to a myriad of budget options, and all have the same problems. Flawed connectivity, noticeably glitchy, slightly reduced sound quality.

These finally fix it. The inclusion of an option to use a headphone jack on devices that let you is a great feature. Along with multipoint connect. They fit perfectly around my skinny neck (your mileage may very on that), so travel with them is a breeze. And for the sound quality, these are absolutely the best headphones for your money.

I was loathe to go to overears full time because I like being able to take one out to hear my surroundings, and every noise passthrough I used before was sucky. (usually the outside noise obnoxiously trebley). Not with these. I actually go to concerts to listen with my headphones on because it actually makes the concerts sound better than with no headphones. Extremely convincing, near perfect noise passthrough.

The app is easy to use and has a great selection of features: from custom EQs, to adjusting the noise pass through, to other various quality of life settings. The 3D adaptive sound feature is great, though a little tricky to set up at first, and noise cancellation is very good, though not the best in the world. The battery life is also almost unbelievable. I use these headphones a lot--sometimes all day--and I still only have to charge them once or twice a week. Multipoint connection is also a very nice plus if, say, I am working at my computer and still want to be able to answer phone calls hands-free.

There are some minor flaws with them, though. First sometimes very low bassey notes from the outside world can trigger the speakers in them and give you very loud, deep popping noises. (E.g., this occasionally happens when I am riding in the car and hitting bumps in the road). Occasional outside sounds in passthrough through will sound muddled. Also the noise cancellation--while quite good--isn't perfect for every situation. Specifically, it has more trouble than, say, Bose headphones with loud, sudden sounds like fireworks. But for the money, it is still the best noise cancellation and passthrough system you can buy.

Another (minor) complaint, though, is that the adaptive settings aren't always very great. It often thinks I am sitting and automatically turns on noise cancellation when I am very much driving or walking around town or once even ice skating--all situations where passthrough is crucial. And even if I am sitting, sometimes I really want passthrough on (like if I'm in a cafe), but it automatically tries to turn noise cancelling on annoyingly. Thankfully, it can be easily overridden in the app. These days, I usually just keep the adaptive sound setting off and adjust the settings to fit the situation but sometimes it will randomly go back to automatic/adaptive mode.

My final and complaint is with the microphone for phone calls. Sometimes it works perfectly and the other line can hear my fine, sometimes all they can hear is background noise, sometimes they really can't hear me at all. I am not sure if it is some sort of firmware issue or if the microphone placement is just too far from my mouth, but for phone calls it can be a tad unreliable. When it works, which is around 75% of the time, it's perfectly good even though I have to talk a little louder than I normally would sometimes.

But all those flaws aside, these are probably the best all-around headphones I have owned and for the $120 I paid for them it's a steal. They may be more expensive as I got them on sale, but I have used headphones multiple times the price that are poorer quality and less functional than these. I'd have paid upwards of twice the price for what I got.; Couldn‚Äôt get the price here for them. They‚Äôre awesome for commuting and keeping the rest of the room quiet; There's alot to appreciate with this one. Priced well, the audio adaptability is great and comfortable to my ears!"
"OneOdio A71 Over Ear Headphones with Mic, On-Line Volume & Share-Port Headsets for Gaming Office Phone Call DJÔºåWired Stereo Headphones with Detachable Boom Mic","2,899",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MToyNjAwNTU4Mzk5NjQ0MTc0OjE3MTkxNjkzOTU6c3BfYnRmOjMwMDE3MDExMzE0ODYzMjo6MDo6&url=%2FOneOdio-A71-Headphones-Professional-Adapter-Free%2Fdp%2FB08QT3D3RY%2Fref%3Dsr_1_117_sspa%3Fcrid%3D2XVH1RLCU6S20%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Efk3iSeXQEQSeatvuV9h7gCVgngl9vqTe8wv9nQ0d0e-7IE-z1bOh1G15BquS0Y7Lxr0TjmGg2wP8jPy7FtYkah0rBk2UHV-TbJo9VrPYouD9twpVBDvQfRBJRH0R0Mbz0hy7Q108p2WHfQNw3kI7gw-eCPYzYdnSUq_rXNbKBgOrIBQ7O65cKaE0uNociHio-bU8J0w3IkuH8uZuJzYvYs0H5PRBW5fwPfQV7B87Vw.4d_4dI87WUDVEmneuflqU2Y8HED6362x7eyir8bMZRA%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3Dheadphones%26qid%3D1719169395%26sprefix%3Dheadphones%252Caps%252C246%26sr%3D8-117-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9idGY%26psc%3D1,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ihRO2WFTS._SY450_.jpg,"INCREDIBLE HI-RES CERTIFIED SOUND: The Hi-Res logo is a of exceptional audio quality, awarded only to audio devices capable of expressing the most excellent art. Unlike ordinary headphones, Pro 10 deliver sound up to 20 KHz for the richest, most nuanced listening experience. Large, 50 millimeter speaker unit drivers combined with neodymium magnets; powerful bass, clear vocal, and crisp high tones form stereo sound.","This headphone is just the best. Just plug into your pc or laptop and just mess with your equalizers a bit and you can get such clear audio output.
The noise cancellation is also good when listening to music or playing games it helps you to listen clearly all the blasts, footsteps, the lows, the highs, etc.
The microphone is also good on these. Playing valo giving clear cut callouts for my teammates. Only one thing don't keep it so close to mouth cause it catches your breathing noise. Put you voice chat to push to talk so much better.
The inline audio slider and mute button helps a lot incase some background noise is annoying you this happened in my Google meet talks and switching tabs is a bit slow so a physical switch is such a life saver.
Can't miss about the comfort as they are so comfortable on the ears as they are big and the earcups are just so soft which is why the clamping force is good and audio output *chef's kiss*.
My usage was a whole day playing games, chatting with friends and also attending classes so they were on all the time.

A bit negatives but just scroll over these. Over a year of usage and the clamping force will disappear and the swivel too so be careful.
The earcups got worn out after a year but the comfort is still there so you will still use it because it's just a pleasure to keep them on.
The mic cable stopped giving audio output to the left earcup after 9 months of usage or so, but the mic was still working. Keep good care.
Mentioned above the mic will catch your breathing noise that's it.
I dunno it might be a fault with my wire but the mic was also catching the audio which was bring played and people could hear it. That was just one issue.

Lastly the best thing, the customer service they are just amazing. When you get your product just register on their website and inquire about the warranty. My mic cable was giving me issues and stopped working so contacting with them constantly helped me to get my replacement unit.
They are prompt in their response and always keep in touch and give updates about the replacement.

So without any doubt the oneodio A71 is worth it for its price. I got it for around 3k now another model named A71D is selling might be still good as they are basically the same.

Final note, if you want a budget pair of headphones with proper premium feeling and with mic also with amazing customer service you must pick these pair of headphones no doubt.

Happy listening and gaming.; Just got the product delivered in 3 days with Prime.

Pros :
1. Mic is superb - everyone I talk to on phone says that the voice is super clear, works with laptops, phones...etc Mic comes with a plastic controller having mute control, volume level control and play/pause button.
2. Headphone - Voice is natural and a bit enhanced when on laptops. But you won't miss on any clarity.
- You cannot expect a HiFi sound, but the vocals, and music contents are well presented with a warm note.

Cons :
1. The connecting cables catch the dust very easy - I would say the suck dust from nearby. But otherwise a good quality metal in them. The Mic is a flexible metalic cable - hard but flexible and good quality. Come attached to the cable and not attached to the headphone.
2. The adjustment band is in messy alignment.. Not sure if it is design issue or the materials issue. Some of the cheapest headphone are abl to give a better quality bands. I would expect it to come for 1-2 years at least. Not a deal breaker though.
3. The ear cups - though the leather used is soft, the phones by themselves are hard and press tight over your ears. After 30 mins, you will feel the pressure. It gets heated, if you don't have sufficient ventilation.

Having said both pros and cons, I like the product - value for the bucks you are paying. Need to see how long this would stay in performance with me.; I'll get straight to the point. These headphones have some of the most balanced sound I've heard.

Here are the cons I found so far:
- There is no active noise cancellation. That is expected because these headphones are not powered. They use AUX for audio
- These headphones have no Bluetooth, if you actually care about it. These headphones are made for gaming and studio use, and for those, the delay in signal caused by the wireless mode is not good.
- These headphones don't have that much bass. Sure, they are more bassy than other studio headphones, but not as much as regular use headphones. And that helps with making and listening to music. Games don't sound as exciting, and that is partly due to the balanced sound.
- The headphones are actually smaller in person. So try and steer clear of it if you have a big head.

The pros are here:
- The sound is really well balanced. From a critical listening standpoint, they do have a slightly higher bass and treble, but that makes the headphones more exciting to listen to. They can make both bassy and trebly music sound good because of the slight V shape sound.
- The microphone is provided within the AUX cable, and it sounds really good. Being a boom mic, it won't catch much background noise.
- The AUX cable is really long, and it is understandable since it is meant to be used for PC gaming and Studio use and the AUX ports are generally aren't in that much proximity
- There is another unique type of AUX cable provided, one side is a regular 3.5 mm stereo, and one side is a quarter inch bit. And that is a really amazing feature. It basically allows you to be able to use a wide variety of audio equipment ranging from phones and laptops to musical instruments and amps.
- When you are using the quarter inch bit on the headphones to use them with phones, you will have a 3.5 mm jack free on your headphones which allow others to also listen in to the music.
- The headphones have pretty low impedance (32 ohms), and that makes it usable by literally anything, from a puny phone to a strong amp. Though I won't suggest the amp because it can get really loud.

And that's it. In conclusion, these headphones are pretty nice with quite a few unique features at this price point. If anyone is wanting to join the audiophile world or just wants some good headphones to listen, I would highly recommend these.; Fully circumaural, so not direct pressure on my ears while wearing them! Love that because I get ear pain easily when wearing on-ear or in-ear headphones.
Very comfortable fit around my ear, great sound quality. Noise cancelling is about a 3/5 when listening at low volumes, like I do regularly, so I can still hear my kids argueing in another room in case I need to pay attention, but as soon as the volume is turned up a bit I cannot hear a thing going on around me. Depending on how you plan to use them, they will be a 5/5 for noise cancelling if you regularly listen at higher volumes.
Bonus: my husband says he can't hear my music when I am listening at high volumes so that's a benefit in my books too.

When wearing them around my neck, the ear pieces rotate to lay flat against my collar bones so they don't feel bulky and are comfortable to wear that way.

Also, if I've got makeup on, I used to hate wearing headphones that would rub my foundation off near my ears. The fabric on these ones doesn't ""soak up"" my makeup at all, and they fit gently enough that they don't leave marks on my makeup either.
All around, I definitely reccomend these. They are worth the price as I've paid a lot more and been really disppointed with some other brands. I would absolutely buy these again!; Ich wollte ein Kopfh√∂rer der die Musik so widergibt wie auf der Platte und das tut er. Wenn ich mehr B√§sse oder H√∂hen brauche stelle ich sie mir dementsprechend ein.

They've been great! The price was reasonable compared to other options, the sound quality is amazing with clear and powerful bass, the cushioning is really soft, and the wire quality is excellent. Plus, it came with a two-year warranty upon registration; I ordered these after hours of researching for decent headphones. These just popped as a recommendation by amazon. Read online reviews especially ones on amazon.com. I ve been listening to them for past 3 hours . Here is my initial feedback -
Sound Quality - Sound signature is V shape . Treble can be slightly sharp at times. Bass is good but at times lacks the extension. Instruments are clear with good separation. Overall sound from these are good but not overwhelming or fantastic. I was not blown away .
Comfort - this is where i am really impressed . The soft memory foam ear cups are really comfortable. I have been wearing these for past 3 hours and my ears dont feel anything. I have owned sony mdr xb450 and sennheiserHD 202 , and compared to them , these are way better.
Build Quality - its all plastic and shiny . I would have loved to see matte finish on these. The rexene leather is soft and good quality. But i dont think colors on these will last .

Box contains - 2 cables and Pouch for storage - which is nice addition.
Over all will give these 4/5; I've been using this October 2019 and I am very happy with the purchase I made. Its slightly heavy on the bass but overall feels okay not like those heavy bass headsets. The Mids and Highs are decent.

The Dual Input is something I appreciate having plugged one end into the phone/tablet and other into an instrument /amplifier. Great for Tutorial Apps. The Cushions are brilliant and comfortable for long usage (read 4-5 hours at one go). It does get sweaty but thats a part of wearing it for long hours anyways (I just flip one for few minutes and then other without actually taking it off entirely). The quality of the microphone is also decent where I've used it for Skype calls and no one ever had to complain about not being able to hear me well. Even the multiplayer games on Console or PC works just great with these.

I got this on sale and money spent was absolutely worth it and will recommend it to all who are looking at high quality headsets at affordable price point.

Update: Jun 2020
Been using these headsets since October 2019 and they are still going strong and nice. So much that I am planning to pick up their A70 Fusion or the A3 with Noise Cancellation ones to go along with.

Update: 2021
The headphones came apart. They just broke off and nothing I can do can set it right. Guess the build quality was just that much.; The OneOdio Studio Pro 50 are one of the best value for money headphones out there, with great comfort and sound quality. I bought them for Rs. 3799, and the closest competitor to these (for me) were the Sony XB550. But then you realise that these have far superior ear cushions and padding on the headband. Thus nothing beats them in comfort. They are over the year style, so your entire ear is covered by the cushions and provides for some decent sound stage. These are passive noise cancelling headphones, so they do a pretty good job at blocking most of the ambient noise. However in too noisy environments some outside noise can seep into them, though not much.
Next is build quality. Most of this headphone is made from plastic, but it is sturdy and I don't see it bending or breaking easily. The ear cups are made from memory protein leather. The headband extenders on both sides are metal. Overall, great build quality for this price.
Sound quality is something interesting here. Out of the box these are definitely a bit more inclined towards bass rather than flat, and to get some of the higher frequencies running you have to tune these a bit. But as soon as you do that, the mids and highs begin to pop up and you truly feel the sound out of these. The bass is great and the vocals are really pronounced and clear. The 50mm drivers do some great work here! Make sure to use some high quality audio to test these out!!
Overall, there is no better product here at this price and definitely ticks all the right boxes for everything to look out for in a headphone. I am extremely glad I bought these and can recommend them any day!; These pair of headphones are a bang for your buck.

I use them mainly for making and listening to music.

Sound quality- I have used many expensive headphones, like the Audio Technica m40s and Beyerdynamic DT 900, I must say the one odio ones blew my mind. I wouldn't say the headphones sound completely flat and neutral but they have a slight color In the mids and highs.

Build quality - The headphones have a solid frame and are quite flexible, for the price these headphones have a great build.

Comfort - The comfort level of these headphones is unmatched, a must-buy for users who plan to use them extensively, you won't even feel them on your head, thanks to the thick padding on the headband and soft huge earpads. These headphones sit over the ear so there is no discomfort at all. Even during the summers, I faced no sweating issues with them.

Sound isolation - It doesn't have any active noise cancellation, but they do a decent job at dimming background noise passively.

Maintenance - After using them for three years, for 4 hours a day, I must say these headphones have held up quite exceptionally, the coating has worn off quite a bit from the headband and cushions, the headband has also started to squeak a bit.

Overall I am quite satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend you buy it; Produto excelente pela faixa de pre√ßo, faixa de frequ√™ncia muito boa confort√°vel pode ser usado para monitorar e tb confer√™ncias e celulares recomendo; This review is for the brown/silver Oneaudio Pro 30 headphones. For the price you are not going to beat the sound quality. I have been difficult to please in audio products for years. Last few years as audiophile products prices has dropped I have been able to afford good quality audio equipment. My main headphones I now use are Sennheiser HD 6xx, Modded Monolith M650, various Sony bluetooth headphones. IEMS: Kzn AS10, Tin Audio T2 Po, Various Klipsh, Shure.

First thing the sound. Listening was done with lossless and MQA files. For the price these are very well balance with enough detail to get an idea what audiophiles look for in quality sound. Highs have decent detail. Not what a sub $50 over the ear headphone normally produces. mids are nice. Again, well balanced with decent detail. Well placed at just under forward sounding. Bass is strong without being boomy. Decent detail. high bass is acceptable and does not muddy the lower mids ACCEPT in music with more complicated lower mid accompanied with lots of bass . Over long listening sessions I felt the need to turn it down a bit but I did not feel it unpleasant. It's hard to peg down the sound style. It's not a V shaped sound as the highs are not pronounced and the bass while not overdone is a bit higher then most flat clinical headphones. These general sound better then 95% of the headphones at this price range. Sound-stage is good for a closed back headphone, especially for the price range. Instrument separation is good. General clarity is good. I have a hard time saying these would be good for STUDIO mixing as the emphasis on bass is a bit high for mixing since you would want as flat as response as possible. These are fun to relax and listen to. Again this is all better then what you would expect at this price range. Even in today's tough market. After sitting for hours with them I feel they are so close audiophile sound it's unbelievable at this price.

Comfort. Very comfortable and light. The pads are deep and soft. Again almost unheard of at this price range. Good clamping force. Soft headband. Only thing I noticed is slightly warm around the ears over an hour or two but nothing uncomfortable.

Build. Here is where it gets tricky. First off its not bad for the price. I would love to see them with less plastic. They have opted for low cost bulky plastic components. I believe they are bulky to give them extra strength. This isn't unusual in the lower cost market but I have seen better designs from competitors but with lower quality sound. The drivers are where it shines with a 90 mm higher quality driver. A good choice. Excellent comfort. You can tell they spent time to get the whole package right. No loose, weak or creaky parts or joints! If they had made these with more metal components I would have been shocked.

Design: Casual with enough small detail. Definitely not fashion cans like Beats but I feel they are on the edge of ""bulky"". I understandable this is to give the plastic extra strength.

Overall they did an excellent job deciding where to go with cutting costs and still making a good product. Although they don't go into great detail and emphasis on the warranty but it is better then average with a full year. I have heard it mentioned elsewhere that it's two years but can't confirm it.

I hope this is just the beginning for them. I can seem them building on this start to get their name out there and I will definitely be keeping an eye on this company. Hopefully we will see them making headphones with better materials but keeping the same attention to balancing the sound with comfort.; Got it for listening music and watching videos. Turn out to be only good for club music and that's that.; Super comfortable, great sound, solid bass. These are my second pair from this company, the first pair lasted almost 2 yrs (I wear headphones for about 10hrs a day). For the price I have no complaints at all.; These earphones sound very good for the price and are comfortable on the head and ears. There‚Äôs no real need for noise cancellation given the plush ear surrounds. I tested them with some UHD music and the highs are clear, mids are good, and the bass needed some EQ adjustment down. Definitely not a flat frequency response but easily fixed according to preference. Very good for tv dialogue. The cords that came with these phones are of commendable quality.

I have some KZ ZAS earbuds for music (which I absolutely love), but these are half the price and being used mostly for late night tv. I‚Äôd say these are a little less responsive and dynamic than the KZs but that‚Äôs the purpose here. Good buy."

Liked the place where buttons configured on the left cup and looks premium. Grey and golden makes it classy. Audio jack included and connects well. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.
Thank you very much,
Your customer Armaan."

It greatly improves sensitivity and connection stability while enjoying 50ms senseless latency of playing experience","Super light, great sound quality, ultrafast connectivity and comfortable; Good product; I was super tempted by the appearance and look of these headphones that led me to research more and go through the reviews.
I bought the Mint green which looks classy.
What I love about it:
- Nice finish
- Soft ear cushions and fit well around the ears
- gives an immersive listening experience
- Easy access buttons for volume, On/Off and ANC
- Sound quality is quite good for me
- Thoughtful of the brand to give extra pins for Piano jack and Airplane input too.

Slightly less points for:
- It's a little tight and not comfortable wearing for long time, at least for me as i have small ears, so it starts pressing on the jaw bone

Note: If the Mic doesn't work for call apps on a computer, go to Sound settings and make sure you have Srhythm selected under Output devices. My Pc had Realtek selected by default, changing it worked fine.; sound quality is great and comfortable to wear these headphones. battery back is good as well.; The ANC works too well , but again not to exaggerate anything, expect not complete noice block out experience within this price range . Its the best in the game in this price range .
Again, worth the investment.; I found this headphone which looks and to some extent has features of high-end headphone but at somewhat low cost. I got Rs 3000 discount on the sale price of Rs 8500 which is one of the reasons I bought it apart from some positive reviews of the product I saw before buying it.

The positive points about the headphone are:
- Over the ear headphone which actually covers your ears and does not sit on your ear
- Bluetooth setup and connection is easy and has good reception
- mic is good and sound quality during calls is clear but due to bluetooth range sometimes the voice breaks once you move a bit away from your phone/computer
- ANC seems to be working well
- charge capacity is good
- quite light-weight and easy control keys on the right side of the headphone to accept and reject calls/change track and change sound volume

Now there are few points which could have been better for a headphone at this price-range:
- The most frustrating point with this headphone is that its loudness capacity is quite low for a headphone like this and maximum volume does not really seems max (I always have to keep the headphone volume to max). For other good headphones used I found the loudness (max volume) is much much higher. So if you are into heavy metals and rock you may not find this headphone very useful.
- The bass quality is not too great
- Though it is actually an over the ear headphone, but I found it is a bit uncomfortable (atleast in hot and humid weather) when both the ears are covered for long time. That maybe also because I am used to inside the ear headphone mostly.
Overall I feel it is okay to buy this headphone if you want to mostly attend calls and hear light music.; for the BIG size it is showing in the ear, it does not cover medium size ears, causing sweat and pain much earlier, as early as 40 mins of usage.; Great product üëå; Amei muito, j√° estou usando faz 1 m√™s todos os dias quase por 2h e ainda n√£o recarrguei. A qualidade do som √© muito boa e isola bem o som de fora. Vale a pena cada centavo, al√©m de lindoo; I never spend a lot on headphones because I'm frugal but my old Bluetooth headphones finally kicked the bucket so I upgraded to these. These are some of the nicest headphones I've ever used, I've never had noise canceling headphones before so I find them quite amazing. So here are the things I like and dislike - overall I love them but there's some smaller problems that I hadn't expected.

Pro's:
-The noise cancelling feature is new and amazing to me, music sounds so much better than I've ever heard it before. I don't think I could go back to headphones without noise cancellation.
-It looks great - I got the colour mint green which I think looks very sleek and like an off-grey colour. Overall I like the design and feel like it's what I expected from the pictures.
-They're extremely comfortable, I have a smaller head so I don't need to adjust the size at all but it is possible. They're so comfy that I wanted to wear them to bed so I could listen to music while I fell asleep. The only reason I didn't is because I realized the noise cancellation would probably make me miss my alarm in the morning.
-They come with a carrying case that makes it easy to bring them anywhere with the charging cable/audio jack cable

Con's:
-The fabric of the carrying case is an unpleasant texture which is a shame since the case is so convenient. I hate touching it, I wish it were smooth or similar to the plastic-fabric muffs/band of the headphones
-I don't like how the muffs lay when I put the headphones around my neck which I do often/when someone tries to speak with me. It's not designed for that situation. The earmuffs also turn outwards, towards who I'm talking to, which would act like a speaker rather than lay flat against my chest where sound would be muffled. Not a huge problem but it's the only pair of over ear headphones I've had that face outwards rather than in.
-There's 4 buttons, the regular backward, pause/play, and forward and then a fourth button that I don't understand. If I hold it eliminates what sounds like static? And if I hold it again the static comes back - the instructions weren't clear on what that was or how to use it. (update: this is the noise cancelling feature)

UPDATE: Overall, if you're not an audio snob these are very nice and comparable to Beats for a fraction of the price. I've had them for roughly 2 months and the only criticism I have is that they're not great for calls - I often have videocalls via my computer and I've been told these emit a small echo-like sound which wasn't brought up to me until well after I reviewed these. If microphone quality is a concern I'd consider a different brand, personally I've had too many problems with headphone mics and I'm looking into good desk microphones to work alongside these headphones.

2+YEARS UPDATE: Long story short, they still work great - also changed 4 stars to 5. I bought these headphones in Dec 2021 and was shocked to learn they blew up as a ""you've got to get these"" item in 2023. Imagine my surprise when people were complimenting me on my 'on trend' headphones, I even came across a video recommending the headphones I'd had for over a year! But most surprising of all was returning to this product page today and realizing how many people had found my review helpful, I'm genuinely so grateful for that. I know it's silly to be sentimental about but I put a lot of time into my reviews. When you don't have a lot of money you do a lot of research before you buy anything, I rely on the testimonies of others so I try to make my reviews as useful as possible for people in the same boat. And for that reason I'd like to say - these headphones are a truly good investment if you're looking for bang for your buck and one of the best purchases I've ever made. These quickly became my work headphones because of their noise cancelling abilities around machinery, I now use them for hours everyday on the job. In a regular 40 hour work week I only need to charge them once a week, recently I've bumped that up to twice but that's more to stop myself from worrying about them dying unexpectedly (not because it's needed). They work just as well as the day they arrived, the appearance is deteriorating due to constant use though. Despite cleaning them frequently they look dingy and the plastic on the earpads has started to tear and peel as of the last 2 weeks. I came to this page to look at what other options this company sells and possibly re-buy these ones to eventually replace my first pair, I don't think they need to be outright replaced yet though, just the ear pads. I am slightly frustrated as the ear pads are replaceable (you can do this yourself easily and it's advertised as a feature in the listing) but I can't find earpads to replace them with. All the options to do so are from 3rd party companies and only come in black which wouldn't look good with my mint headphones. Still, I don't want to replace perfectly good headphones.; Despu√©s de unas semanas de uso (en los que no he vuelto a cargar la bater√≠a, despu√©s de la primera carga antes de usarlos) estoy muy satisfecho con estos auriculares.
C√≥modos, buena calidad de sonido, bater√≠a muy duradera. Compra maestra!
Para quienes les da calor y les provoca sudor, que prueben a ponerse un gorro de lana en verano. Creo que es buena comparaci√≥n, y quiz√° deban adquirir otro tipo de auriculares.
Recomendables!; Hij doet het goed en makkelijk bedienbaar; Je suis tr√®s satisfait de mes √©couteurs. Tr√®s bon rapport qualit√© prix."

One of the standout features is the impressive clarity they provide, allowing you to hear even the most subtle details in your music. The sound quality is top-notch, making for an immersive listening experience.
The build quality of these earphones is also noteworthy. Unlike many other wired earphones that feel flimsy and prone to damage, these have a sturdy and substantial cord. This gives me confidence that they will hold up well over time, even with regular use.
Overall, I highly recommend these earphones to anyone looking for a high-quality listening experience without breaking the bank. The combination of excellent sound quality, durable construction, and affordable price make them a smart purchase that is definitely worth the investment.; I am a musician by profession who also produces. I bought these for my son. The positives are build quality, sharpness in the mid and high range, but bass is not good enough to balance it out so it gets a little tiring for long listening as sound is not rounded enough. But I can't really complain because at this price point I don't have the right to. Overall... Go for it. It's sturdy and fits ears perfectly. Blocks all external sound.; This is a great product. It's sound quality, call quality and everything is good. I am not sure about the shortcuts but it doesn't matter that much. But many of you may face a problem. After connecting if earphone logo is not showing in your mobile that means your mobile do not support type-c connectivity devices except charging.
There is a simple solution to this. I cannot guarantee wheather this feature is available in all devices but you can check. After connecting, if earphone logo is not showing, then go to settings, search OTG (under networks and connections,p.b:- may vary device to device) and turn on the OTG option. It should solve the problem. If not then buy another product.; Sound quality is okay but not enough bass compared to other branded products. Then, the build of product is not sufficient as it hampers with comfort in the ears due to the rubber extensions (size optimization is required). Stable for long time use and performance is upto the mark.; Quality is good. Cable is sturdy.
Sound quality is good.
Value for money.; This is the best earphone. 110% reccomend. Using it since last 3-4 years. It's top notch. Everything is top notch. Long life. Good quality. Good sound. Good performance.; I'm so glad that I have ordered that earphones I love the quality of earphone; Pros:

1.Extra Bass Driver: The 10mm extra bass driver contributes to a noticeable low-frequency response, providing a satisfying bass experience for bass enthusiasts.
2.HD Sound: The earphones deliver clear and crisp HD sound, making them suitable for various music genres and multimedia content.
3.In-Line Controls: Convenient in-line controls for playback and call management add to the user-friendly design.
4.Comfortable Fit: The ergonomic design ensures a comfortable fit, suitable for extended usage without causing discomfort.
5.Tangle-Free Cable: The tangle-free cable design helps in reducing the hassle of untangling cords, contributing to overall convenience.

Cons:
1.Build Quality: The overall build quality feels average, with some users reporting durability issues over extended use.
2.Microphone Quality: The microphone quality is passable but may not meet the expectations of users who prioritize crystal-clear call audio.
3.Limited Noise Isolation: The earphones offer limited noise isolation, allowing external sounds to interfere with the listening experience, particularly in noisy environments.
4.Bass Dominance: While the extra bass driver is a highlight, it may overpower other frequencies, leading to a less balanced audio profile for those seeking a more neutral sound.
5.Lack of Extra Features: The earphones lack advanced features such as in-line volume control or noise-canceling capabilities, limiting their versatility."

In low cost enjoy music very nice loud.......
I purchased it Rs 599/- only.; I got it for 799/- within 24 hrs. Using it for 10 days now, don't have much complaints. I will sum up in pros and cons after my experience with the earphones. Reducing 1 star for the first CON in my review below.
PROS:
1) Cheaper than some of the other earphone brands with 12 months warranty as well.
2) Good Audio quality, I found it was better sounding than an Over the Ears Headphones I have from Cosmic Byte (G4000). Clear sound and good audio reproduction.
3) Battery life serves good at least for my taste as I am not a heavy user (I generally use it 2hours a day max.). Just FYI, I have charged the earphones twice in 10 days.
4) Comfortable earphones with very less weight and good ear fit.
5) Mic quality for calls is decent, not much noise cancellation for background noise but whatever is sent through is very clear and accurate.
CONS:
1) Biggest con for me personally is that I can't watch online youtube or twitch videos with this one (usually have to go 360p or lower for smoother experience) as it hampers the wifi speed on my mobile when connected to the mobile via bluetooth. This is happening because my wifi router is 2.4Ghz and it is interferring with the bluetooth signal to reduce internet speeds. A simple 5Ghz router would solve this issue, but as I don't have it, its become an issue. Also, I can tell if you run videos from mobile internet then you don't face this issue.
2) Only SBC bluetooth audio format supported hence not the best audio quality.
3) Left and Right ear plugs always confuse me while wearing it on, also the length of left and right side is not exactly the same, slight mismatch is present, which goes to show poor quality checks from the company.
4) Battery life could have been better or atleast charge time should have been reduced. It takes 1.5 hrs charge time for 6-8hrs battery life.
5) Battery indicator is very wrongly calibrated. From 100 to 70% discharging, it takes 5-6 hrs playtime, while from 70 to 10% it takes just 30 odd minutes. This again shows poor quality checks from the company.; i am using this last 4 years still its doesn't have any problem in sound ,bass, backup anything. Go for it. I love it.; Good overall; High price but average quality not very good not very bad; Overall performance is good and value for money product; Battery backup okay sound is clear but need vibrations when incoming call; This neckband is good quality is impressive build quality is also good but eartips and cable is missing from box . They forget to pack them . Otherwise this neckband is 4 star

Edit . I found eartips and cable actually they got dropped when I open it but this is not of use tips are small and big and cable has no quality even it does work yes the cable is not working
. So I would say battery backup is good . Bass is also good but calling is very very good . I can't expect that this earphones speak full number when call came .. value for money go for it"

Some reviews are saying that these press a lot on your ears but if that‚Äôs the case, then you should get the m40s cuz they are more comfortable, some of my friends have those. Btw I‚Äôm happy with these for rn but definitely will be upgrading to m40 or m50.; the sound is good , everything is good and the headphones are durable the only problem is that the wire is really long and these cannot be used outside with ease; Like: Sound Quality, Decent Build Quality

Dislike: Comfort, head crusher.; First of all, kudos to amazon for the excellent packaging and prompt delivery.
So, I come from that group of people who never spent more than 500 bucks for a pair of headphones. I've always used the pair that came along with my phone. I also had a Sony mdr-zx110 for sometime. You can say that this is my first real pair of high quality headphones. Here are my thoughts.

Packaging:
The box is neatly packed with some paperwork, a connector to a DAC, and the headphones themselves. No surprises there.

Build and Comfort:
I was quite surprised by how light they felt at first use. The leather cups and top padding are an absolute delight and the adjusting mechanism works like a charm. It is a bit tight initially, but gets better with use. The cable is 3m long, which can be a good or a bad thing. Personally, would have liked it to be a bit shorter. Even after listening with them for 4 hours straight, there was neither any heat build up nor was it getting uncomfortable. But it made my ears sweat more than I was expecting it to. Overall, absolute delight to use even for longer periods.

Sound quality:
I plugged it into my Moto X and listened to some Coldplay and some Indian film music. I was expecting it to blow my mind, but realised my phone was doing justice to these pair. It sounds amazing though, better than anything I have tried. But had this feeling it had more to offer. AudioFX does offer a much better listening experience when turned on.
So, I plugged it into my laptop( a HP with B&O audio) and the tables turned completely. It was unlike anything I've experienced. The sounds coming out were so natural, and so very clear. Was able to catch every note of every instrument, was finding new sounds in the tracks that I didn't know even existed. There is adequate bass and the treble is excellent. The mids are where these really shine. The vocals and instrumentals are mind-blowing. Every genre I listened to was absolutely amazing. I think these are best suited for classical, instrumental, and Jazz. I listened to some hip-hop and found the bass a bit short but nevertheless, they did sound incredible. I tried some games like COD,Battlefield and FIFA, it enhances the experience quite a lot. In FIFA, the crowd comes alive and the gunshots in COD are brilliantly reproduced.

Verdict:
If you are a casual listener who is looking for their first pair of high quality headphones, look no further. Absolutely loving every moment of using this pair. It introduced me to a whole new dimension in music. Every other headphone I use now just doesn't feel right. In short, its the best 3000 bucks I ever spent.; This is one of the best purchases i have made in recent times. The headphones are simply awesome bang for the buck. I purchased them from 3200 from Amazon and got the delivery in 2 days since the 2 day shipping was available. This review is being posted after about 2 weeks of usage.

Dividing the Review into Pros and Cons -

Pros

1. Excellent Soundstage.
2. Brilliant Clarity. Each instrument can be heard clearly and you will hear sounds that you never heard before.
3. Build Quality is sturdy and premium materials have been used. Considering that M20x are the starting range of the Audio Technica Headphone, i have to say they have done a really good job. Premium materials have been used, the foam at the top of the band and around the ear cups is of really good quality.

Cons

1. The wire is really long and while this can be a pro as well since it gives the ability to move around i would have like a shorter wire and preferably a detachable wire as is provided with the 40x and other models higher up in the range

2. They are big ! Not something that will be very easy to carry around and i rely on by earphones for taking along in my laptop bag. These are meant to be enjoyed at home for me. When worn properly your entire ears will fit in the ear cups. And this provided excellent sound quality and noise isolation. However, the size will need getting used to and now after 2 weeks i do not feel that awkward and am able to enjoy them despite the huge size.

3. Your ears will sweat since they are in the ear cups and while they cannot be worn for long intervals - that is more than 30 minutes at the start. Once you get used to them - after about 2 weeks and when sitting in an AC room you can easily listen to them for hours. The sound quality is so good that once you are accustomed to the size you enjoy them immensely.

At the end i would like to say that these are something that every music lover should have ! Yes, the sound quality is so good ! I listened to all sorts of music on these and i have to say that when used with an equalizer they are especially good. I personally use an App called ""Power Amp"" on Android, which works great. Than i also listen to a lot of Wynk and You Tube for which an app called ""Bass Equalizer"" does a really good job. This app will work with online music, that is the beauty of it.

The headphones have a lot of bass, their inbuilt signature is flat and for bass lovers, when used with the apps i mentioned they give sufficient bass. The music that excels the most on these headphones is live music, like MTV unplugged. And Acoustic music where guitars and Cellos are used.

In a nutshell, if you primarily listen to music on earphones since they are so much more convenient and easy to carry than these will be a revelation for you.; Realmente uma das melhores compras que eu j√° fiz. O n√≠vel de detalhamento sonoro √© consideravelmente melhor do que o do akg K92 que tive a oportunidade de testar durante um m√™s. Ao ouvir a m√∫sica Rumble do skrillex, que ganhou o grammy, fui capaz de captar micro sons muito baixinhos, frequ√™ncias extremamente espec√≠ficas que foram colocadas na m√∫sica apenas para ambienta√ß√£o e ‚Äúamortecimento‚Äù, al√©m disso, a constru√ß√£o √© muito boa e n√£o parece que vai quebrar t√£o cedo. Super recomendo!; For a while I have been looking at setting up my own home studio for streaming, gaming, and music. I've been looking for decent pair of studio headphones for a while when I saw these. I saw the low price for them and was like ""they're a good brand, just might not be the quality I'm looking for."", I took the chance and ordered them. Two days later they came in and I put them through their paces and was shocked and excited about the sound quality and the comfort! these were exactly what I was looking for to get started on putting my studio together! Thank Audio-Technica!; +. Tr√®s bonne puissance sonore.
+. Excellente isolation sonore.
+. La palette des sons est tr√®s riche.
-. Les basses sont un peu trop en avant ce qui cr√©e un l√©ger d√©s√©quilibre.
-. Le casque serre un ""tout petit"" peu trop fort.
Je pense qu'il est difficile de faire mieux pour ce prix.; Really comfortable to wear for long periods. The cord is a good length and they feel pretty robust and fairly light too.

They fit well on different sized heads as you can easily adjust them and the sound quality is great too.

I ended up returning them because I had lost my main pair and ended up locating them again so I no longer required these. However, if my main pair ever fails me this will be my go to for purchase again as I really enjoyed my time with them. There‚Äôs a lot of clarity in the sound which is exactly what I need when field recording. I also enjoyed the comfortability whilst recording for long sessions too.

I‚Äôve also had issues with headphones in the past always dropping off my head which is really frustrating. This wasn‚Äôt a problem with these at all. I‚Äôd highly recommend them and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be purchasing them again in the future once my current headphones fail eventually.

I also think the price is really reasonable for these. What you get for the price is great.; Good brand, good sound"

ÊúâÁ∑ö„ÇÇ„Åü„Åæ„Å´„ÅØËâØ„ÅÑ„Åß„Åô„Å≠„ÄÇ; I got these for my 8 year old son and these headphones have absolutely no right to sound this good for $20. I am an audiophile with 30 years of listening experience and I am absolutely stunned at what they have been able to achieve at such a low price point. Simply put, this level of sound quality just wouldn't have been possible even 10 years ago.

What strikes you most about the sound is the sense of dynamics and rhythmic drive. Even out of a bare iPhone 6 with no headphone amp, these 'phones deliver a nice energy to the music, following rhythmic lines quickly and easily. The bass in particular came through with authority and weight and I was impressed at how solid and punchy it sounded - again, for this price point. This is not nearly a high resolution set of 'phones by any stretch - for example, the treble is slightly rolled off to be sure, but personally I'd much prefer treble that is rolled off and still pleasing, rather than the shrill sound that is far too common with cheap gear. They seemed to work reasonably well directly out of my iPhone and Macbook too, sounding just fine directly from the headphone jack with no amp needed. But of course they DID sound much much better with one of my home headphone amps (Naim Audio Headline in the context of an all-Naim system), where they even began to even start to give you a tiny bit of ""snap"" - but then again, using a set of $20 headphones with an $800 headphone amp is pretty ridiculous and unlikely! But it was a fun experiment.

Lastly, the headphones themselves seemed much higher quality than the price would suggest. The earpieces were soft and overall they were reasonably comfortable. All in all, you just can't go wrong with these, and I was simply not expecting this at only 20 bucks. What have you got to lose?; I bought these to use on public transit on my way to and from work. I wanted a cheap pair in case they got broken or stolen. I must admit, when I first opened the package they arrived in I wasn't impressed, but I gave them a chance. I had read all of the negative comments about them. I have had them for a few weeks now and I like them. They are comfortable, the sound is decent, there is more bass than I expected. I also have a pair of studio beats and a pair of studio AKGs that I love. For the price, if something happens to them, I would get another pair. The negative remarks I read must be people who are very picky and hard to please. You can't expect good quality from inexpensive headphones. I am pleased for the price I paid. They definitely don't compare to my beats or AKGs but they aren't supposed to.; Clarity is awesome! A great buy. At first it is tight over the ears but with a few expanding pulls it become easy to fit. A must have product."

Amazing Noise Cancellation .It has Bluetooth connectivity with multiple devices and also got ox cable for wired connectivity. I highly recommend it, if you want to spend monet on great wireless headphone.; 1,Appearances is good, good fit perfect balanced weight goes smooth and easy over the ears. But too much or usage might get little warmth but that‚Äôs okay I must say.
2. Value for money : yes sounds good clear voice and all instruments but can‚Äôt expect too loud sound and heavy bass. Because it‚Äôs simply not designed for heavy musics.
3.connectivity it‚Äôs very much better in this devise. Well I‚Äôve seen some connection drops in the darker area (I.e phones in pocket, phone in the bag or in the glove box of a car) but not too bad I must say, it fights really hard and good to maintain good connection.
4.build quality & attention: build quality is fair I can say a bit of mettle and major combination of soft plastic and cushion makes it light and strong. And yes people will look at what your wearing they show some good attention.

Conclusion :Just had this gig for some days that‚Äôs all . So far so good I can say. But the way they build this and tech used in this it should easily last for about 2-3 years. But be sure to buy some extra warranty for 2 years or something. Because JBL are such a brand where they show the best in the day and hides the worst for the night. I‚Äôve experienced it before down the line after manufacturing warranty there will be some issues that gives you surprises. Later you wish to repair it or simply buy a new one would your hard choice to make.; I like this product for the value for money it provides. I've been using this headphone for the past week and I'm happy to report that my experience has been pleasant while using these for a person who's not a hardcore audiophile.

PROs:
(a) Comfortable over the ear fit for average ear size; headphones do not feel heavy over long use
(b) Over par, more than advertised battery life. Easily lasts a week with heavy usage and ANC turned off. And 3-4 days with moderate ANC usage.
(c) App support is amazing on android. Provides the following features:
(i) Active Noise Cancellation
(ii) Ambient Noise Aware
(iii) Talkthrough
(iv) Self voice aware volume control
(v) Equalizer support (bass, extra bass modes pre-configured - +ve experience using them)
(vi) Separate Audio and Video modes for consuming content
(d) Almost negligible noise bleed
(e) Solid build quality. Tactile buttons. Travel friendly (foldable ear cups)

Some minor CONs:
(a) ANC could be better. Not very strong ANC
(b) Button placement could be better
(c) Foam in the ear muffs is built to last and not comfy if cups lay over your ear cartilages for long duration (if you have bigger ears).
(d) dark blue colour just looks horrendously cheap in daylight as outside shell material is plastic. Go for black, white or purple (if it ever comes back in stock); The ear pads are too small .. they hurt after few minutes of usage .
There was a weird line that looks like a crack on the side of the headphones and this isn't only on my product.
The Bass of the headphones is trash as well. The headband is tight and if extended they float over the head instead of resting when extended. The build quality of the Headband is as good as the Boat771 feels like it'll snap. Overall I'd rather the Boat 751 more then the JBL 770 In terms of Bass, Comfort, vocals .. the only up this headphones got over the Boat751 is the Noise cancellation.. which isn't even that good.
These headphones aren't worth 6k at all; Pros:
+ Super audio quality pretty much at all frequency level
+ 10 meter Bluetooth range with quick pairing
+ Better microphone quality
+ Better noise cancellation
+ Super battery life
+ Companior app to adjust audio mode and equalizer
+ Appropriate packaging

Cons:
- Little costlier; ; Everything is fine except for the crackling sound that occurs during calls üìû, which happens consistently in every call. This makes me frustrated, honestly. However, other than that, normal audio sounds good and has quality.
One point to note is that it's not suitable for people who prefer high bass audio. Also, the building quality is good considering its price. Battery-wise, I would say it provides long duration.
Connectivity is fast enough to say it fast connectivity.
And jbl app is the main hero here, without app it's not worth using.
Noise cancellation: 3 out of 5

Value for money? : ....... May be.....may be not.... Personal opinion.

Charging: 4 out of 5; The headphones fit quite well. It is apt for all kind of people. It has got great comfort in its cushions as well as it is soft and comfortable. Its appearance also feels great. Quite a great one without anything fancy. It can be folded to fit into any bags for these. Coming to the quality, it offers a great deal of high quality surround sound feel but lags behind a little bit of bass boost. It has Bluetooth v5.3 making it very much easy to connect. Software updates are available for both headphones software as well as the languages in use. The applications covers a lot of options for us to configure the device. It is a great choice if you can buy during the sales.; O fone tem uma excelente qualidade, o custo benef√≠cio vale muito. O produto √© original, seu cancelamento de ru√≠do muito bom. Uma pena que n√£o d√° pra trocar as borrachas conforme o uso pois com o tempo elas v√£o gastando. Do resto o material √© muito bom. Vale a pena; Qualidade excelente, n√£o esperava menos.
A qualidade de √°udio √© muito boa e o encaixe tamb√©m, achei muito confort√°vel e se adapta a diversos formatos de cabe√ßa, mas acho importante ressaltar que ele pode ser apertado nas orelhas e a parte de espuma n√£o √© grande o suficiente para se encaixar do jeito mais confort√°vel, o que n√£o me incomoda, mas √© algo para considerar.
Como ele se encaixa muito bem, eu posso usar em v√°rias atividades di√°rias, inclusive para me exercitar, e ele permanece fixo sem nem amea√ßar cair.
A dura√ß√£o da bateria √© extraordin√°ria e eu posso us√°-lo confortavelmente durante v√°rias horas de estudo.
Recomendo, √≥timo custo-benef√≠cio.; Vamos l√°!

em rela√ß√£o a entrega:

chegou r√°pido, por volta de 10 dias a encomenda j√° estava na minha casa, veio perfeitamente embalado e nada amassado

em rela√ß√£o a est√©tica do fone:

muito bonito, n√£o √© muito leve e nem muito pesado, peso ideal!! O seu tamanho tamb√©m √© ideal, pois n√£o √© muito grande, ele √© dobr√°vel o que ajuda caso queira guardar na bolsa, vem com tr√™s bot√µes e a loga marca da jbl! Ele √© fosco lind√≠ssimo

em rela√ß√£o a conforto:

√ìtimo! Ele √© justo e n√£o fica folgado na cabe√ßa, mas n√£o se preocupe, n√£o √© t√£o apertado a ponta de incomodar, uso ele pra fazer muscula√ß√£o, corrida, crossfit e outros exerc√≠cios que exigem muitos movimentos, ele simplesmente n√£o sai do lugar, eu tinha essa preocupa√ß√£o, mas superou minhas expectativas.

em rela√ß√£o ao som:

Espetacular! O volume √© alto, abafa muito bem os ru√≠dos, voc√™ n√£o consegue ouvir o que as pessoas dizem ao redor, um ponto interessante dele √© que vc pode se afastar o quanto for que o fone n√£o desconecta, n√£o baixa o som ou qualquer coisa do tipo

em rela√ß√£o a bateria:

√© surreal a dura√ß√£o da bateria, estou usando h√° uma semana e ela n√£o est√° nem na metade!! Obs: uso todos os dias por volta de 2hrs a 3hrs, acredito que deve durar mais ou menos duas semanas tranquilamente

Por fim, se voc√™ busca um fone com o pre√ßo bom, com durabilidade de bateria espetacular, com som bom, voc√™ precisa comprar esse fone!!! Apenas comprem, n√£o ir√£o se arrepender; Estava h√° muito tempo buscando um fone de ouvido Bluetooth com cancelamento de ru√≠do ativo at√© 500 reais, at√© me deparar com esse da JBL. Opini√£o ap√≥s um m√™s de uso: espuma muito confort√°vel, utilizo o fone o dia todo (e uso √≥culos), se encaixa bem na cabe√ßa e n√£o tive problemas nem correndo at√© o metr√¥. Possui cabo p2 remov√≠vel, mas devido a dura√ß√£o da bateria, s√≥ usei para testar (carrego o fone uma vez a cada 2/3 dias, com uso continuo). Cancelamento de ru√≠do bom (nada excepcional, mas cumpre seu papel). Apresenta ru√≠do em trepida√ß√µes (como em trens/metr√¥), possivelmente vindo do microfone, mas nada que atrapalhe muito a experi√™ncia. Padr√£o de qualidade sonora cl√°ssica da JBL, com foco nos graves acentuados. Recomendo a compra!; Good product, so far i everything is good."

JBL vs Sony XM5

Audio Quality: Its up to your preference. They both have a different sound signature. I found JBL offering more clarity in terms of music experience and if you switch to Sony right after JBL you'll feel there's some compression or processing being done. As an example - if these both were a glass window, you'll feel that there's a 90% transparent film on XM5 vs no film on JBL.

Standalone you'll like both they are really good also you can adjust audio to your liking in both. One thing in favor of JBL is that it has a personalized sound setting - it can't be a deciding factor but it boosts frequencies basis your preference and it does make a 10-15% difference in music experience.

Noise Canceling: Both are at par, XM5 may be slightly better but not by a huge margin. You'll still hear some noises inside both headphones. Maybe you'll hear more Hmmm noises on JBL and more Grrr noises on XM5. That being said there's not really a huge difference when you look at the price.

Noise Canceling on Calls: Here JBL is better, I recorded a call where I switched between both these headphones side by side on the same call. There was a hissing noise from Sony's mic however JBL was super silent and surprisingly captured better depth.

App experience: Sony has really good app but there's a learning curve to it. JBL on the other hand has a simplest app, just click on the few things and you are sorted. To put it in context - JBL app is like apple iPhone simple UI, let's you do your stuff and you wont be lost, Sony's app is like Android - you have lots and lots of options and you'll probably use 5-10 settings max but you can get lost.

Why is JBL not Popular then?
It doesn't mean it is not good, there's some catching up to do by the marketing team.

Why are there so many negative comments?
I have no idea, because of those comments I wend to check the device at store and bought it later.

Shall I buy it then?
of course, try to look for discount better offers negotiate with the sales person. Usually XM5 are available around INR 22K best price and these you should aim for 19K as best price on sale.; Clear sound quality with good comfort. I recommend to those who want to listen for long hours.; ; These are the best headphones you can buy under 25k. The noice cancellation is great also the call quality is good. The customization options available in the app makes it sound better.; Volume is extremely slow cannot enjoy the song played performance is not up to the mark; First impressions is just wow, soo soft and light weight while wearing; Having used headphones of Sony ,Bowers and Wilkins,Senneheiser very much disappointed with the overall sound of JBL tour one m2. The sound stage is good , mids , lows ,high sound almost perfect but the volume is very very poor. It can't even compete with xm3 /xm4's when it comes to anc and sound. The app is clean and easy to use . Other features works well but very much disappointed with the volume; I have purchased it for around 20k on the day of release. The quality of sound is top notch, fits perfectly with no harm on longer use. Gets a bag to travel. Loved it; Achei excepcional a fun√ß√£o do ‚Äúnoise cancelling‚Äù. Muito simples de desativar para ouvir o som ambiente. Os controles ‚Äúhands free‚Äù com gestos e leves toques nos phones s√£o √≥timos. Agora o que realmente impressiona √© a qualidade do som. Estou ouvindo m√∫sicas que conhe√ßo h√° anos, e parecem ser novas grava√ß√µes, posso ouvir com precis√£o detalhes e nuances de instrumentos e voz que simplesmente n√£o conhecia. Parece caro, mas vale cada centavo investido.; Package was supposed to be delivered 3 days after I ordered it, but I received it after only a day.

The Zeb Bang Pro comes in an ergonomic and sleek design that fits comfortably in my ears. They are lightweight and stay securely in place even during workouts. The earbuds also have touch-sensitive controls for play/pause, skip tracks, and volume adjustment, which are quite responsive.

**Sound Quality:**
In terms of sound quality, these earbuds deliver crisp and clear audio. The bass is punchy, the mids are well-balanced, and the highs are sharp. Whether I'm listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls, the audio quality has been consistently impressive.

**Connectivity:**
Pairing the Zeb Bang Pro with my devices was a breeze. The Bluetooth connection has been stable, and I haven't experienced any dropouts during usage. These earbuds also support mono mode, allowing me to use either earbud individually if needed.

**Battery Life:**
One of the standout features of the Zeb Bang Pro is its exceptional battery life. With around 7-8 hours of playback time on a single charge, I rarely find myself needing to recharge them. The charging case provides additional backup, extending the total usage time to a substantial length.

**Call Quality:**
Call quality is another area where these earbuds shine. The built-in microphone captures clear audio, and I've had no issues with call clarity, whether indoors or in noisy environments.

**IPX4 Rating:**
The IPX4 rating makes the Zeb Bang Pro sweat and splash-resistant, making them suitable for workouts and outdoor activities. However, they may not be suitable for submersion in water.

In conclusion, the Zebronics Zeb Bang Pro wireless earbuds are a solid choice for those seeking a budget-friendly yet high-quality audio experience. Their comfortable design, impressive sound quality, long battery life, and ease of use make them a commendable option in the wireless earbud market.

One of the standout features is the impressive clarity they provide, allowing you to hear even the most subtle details in your music. The sound quality is top-notch, making for an immersive listening experience.
The build quality of these earphones is also noteworthy. Unlike many other wired earphones that feel flimsy and prone to damage, these have a sturdy and substantial cord. This gives me confidence that they will hold up well over time, even with regular use.
Overall, I highly recommend these earphones to anyone looking for a high-quality listening experience without breaking the bank. The combination of excellent sound quality, durable construction, and affordable price make them a smart purchase that is definitely worth the investment.; I am a musician by profession who also produces. I bought these for my son. The positives are build quality, sharpness in the mid and high range, but bass is not good enough to balance it out so it gets a little tiring for long listening as sound is not rounded enough. But I can't really complain because at this price point I don't have the right to. Overall... Go for it. It's sturdy and fits ears perfectly. Blocks all external sound.; This is a great product. It's sound quality, call quality and everything is good. I am not sure about the shortcuts but it doesn't matter that much. But many of you may face a problem. After connecting if earphone logo is not showing in your mobile that means your mobile do not support type-c connectivity devices except charging.
There is a simple solution to this. I cannot guarantee wheather this feature is available in all devices but you can check. After connecting, if earphone logo is not showing, then go to settings, search OTG (under networks and connections,p.b:- may vary device to device) and turn on the OTG option. It should solve the problem. If not then buy another product.; Sound quality is okay but not enough bass compared to other branded products. Then, the build of product is not sufficient as it hampers with comfort in the ears due to the rubber extensions (size optimization is required). Stable for long time use and performance is upto the mark.; Quality is good. Cable is sturdy.
Sound quality is good.
Value for money.; This is the best earphone. 110% reccomend. Using it since last 3-4 years. It's top notch. Everything is top notch. Long life. Good quality. Good sound. Good performance.; I'm so glad that I have ordered that earphones I love the quality of earphone; Pros:

1.Extra Bass Driver: The 10mm extra bass driver contributes to a noticeable low-frequency response, providing a satisfying bass experience for bass enthusiasts.
2.HD Sound: The earphones deliver clear and crisp HD sound, making them suitable for various music genres and multimedia content.
3.In-Line Controls: Convenient in-line controls for playback and call management add to the user-friendly design.
4.Comfortable Fit: The ergonomic design ensures a comfortable fit, suitable for extended usage without causing discomfort.
5.Tangle-Free Cable: The tangle-free cable design helps in reducing the hassle of untangling cords, contributing to overall convenience.

Cons:
1.Build Quality: The overall build quality feels average, with some users reporting durability issues over extended use.
2.Microphone Quality: The microphone quality is passable but may not meet the expectations of users who prioritize crystal-clear call audio.
3.Limited Noise Isolation: The earphones offer limited noise isolation, allowing external sounds to interfere with the listening experience, particularly in noisy environments.
4.Bass Dominance: While the extra bass driver is a highlight, it may overpower other frequencies, leading to a less balanced audio profile for those seeking a more neutral sound.
5.Lack of Extra Features: The earphones lack advanced features such as in-line volume control or noise-canceling capabilities, limiting their versatility."

We can hear outside noise. So we can judge if any other vehicle coming near and give a sign for overtake using horn. We can use as a neckband or airpod.; Writing this review after 45 days of using. Still works great except few bugs sometimes (rarely).

PROS:
The sound quality is great for price, average battery life, very comfortable to my ears, pretty fast bluetooth connectivity, connects with multiple devices with no problem

CONS:
It kinda lags a bit when you move while wearing it, but its not disturbing as it stops quickly. It lags heavily if you move away from your phone in like 2 meters. The radius is really low. The volume increasing/decreasing function only works in my laptop. There is a slight latency for first few seconds after you connect it. And it has this useless mode called ""gaming mode"", which on turning on, a guy says ""time to fight"" or smth in an optimus prime voice.; Didn't actually believe these earbuds would be so good. The bass is just awesome and the music is so clear and even if there is a loud noise outside can't hear it at all....
Really worth buying these buds for the price. They fit and feel very light on the ears. Looks are good. Pairing is simple. Connectivity is good so far.; Serves its purpose, you are aware of the surrounding while wearing it. But it tends to hurt your ears soon. Battery back is good , touch response is accurate, good aesthetics. Sound quality is good keeping in view that these are not in ear. Bass is average as compared to in ear which is obvious however in quiter places good bass can be felt. Yes you can run wearing these not going to fell in any instances.; Everything is good but value of money
No Dual Pairing Option avilable, No app control features avilable, Sound Quality good but bass is not good; Colour is very good and his finishing such a very precious look like very premium and very awesome and backup is very good; Best value for money pods which doesn't go inside the ear. Great for communication. Decent bass. Music volume enough for light listeners. Will definitely recommend for those who has ear irritations with pods which go inside the ear. Lightweight. Doesn't feel heavy after long usage.; From price point of view, this over the ear earphones perform well with decent sound volume keeping ear health in mind.

The major problem I faced is it's not comfortable to wear for longer duration. It starts paining. It might need time to get used to perhaps.
Those looking for noise cancellation feature, this doesn't have that. But good for those who are health conscious."

UI:
Power On. Hold the center button for 2 seconds and the earphones with say in a Japanese/Indian woman's voice, ""power On, battery about 70%"". She does not sound Chinese like the cheap Chinese headphones. Her voice volume level is not very high either.

BT pairing:
Turn off the headset, press and hold to center button but keep holding the same button. The headsets voice will say, Bluetooth pairing"". Once connected, it will say, ""Bluetooth connected"". If BT disconnects, the voice says, ""Bluetooth disconnected"".

Next track:
Press and hold the + button for 2 seconds and the headset will make a cute ""chime"" and load the next song in the playlist of any app. I like this feature of the chime because this way I know the headset has accepted the command and loading the next track. However, holding the button for 2 second everytime you want to change songs can get annoying and painful if you want to skip a couple of songs of just skipping endlessly waiting for the right song to play. Buttons aren't very soft but do have a tactile click to ensure you feel the click when pressed.

Power off: just like power on, hold the center button for 2 seconds and the headset will turn off.

Volume up/down: No audible feedback, just volume increase or decrease.

Status LED:
Blue: when On and slow blinking when connected to bt. When in pairing mode, the same light blinks quickly in the same blue colour.

Orange: while charging. Solid on.
Green/off: 90% and above.

Physical clues: tiny nub on the left ear plug to denote left side. Only reputed brands have it.
Same tiny bump is made in the volume up button on the controller to denote volume +.
Coloured Dots on the plastic controller to denotr left and right channel.
Ear plugs are colour coded and fit very well in my ears. Most of the ear plugs fall out of my ears while talking. These don't. I use the smallest one.

What does Sony offer?
A very neat guide on how to insert the ear plugs in your ears the most comfortable way and ensure the best seal for clear audio. I've never known that you can pull you ear up from the top corner and gently place the ear plug into your ear canal. Once placed comfortably, drop the ear and let the ear canal seal in.

Audio App. It's basically a music player designed to detect the sony earphones. If you use spotify you can use this app to setup an equaliser. It plays MP3 from your storage too. My phone already has a built in Equalizer. I don't use any eq because the sound stage on these is flat. So all types of audio sounds great.

FAQ
Is it flimsy?
No, but feels like you might damage it if you're not careful.

Does it really last 25hr?
Yes, I've tested it sort of. And never managed to run out of battery.

How much did you spend on it?
1.6k

Audio lag?
None. I tested it with Android TV, LG web os, Android phone, ps4 and iPad. No issues of lag or disconnection or audio drop on super quiet moments of the song.

Bass?
Very decent and controlled.
Vocals?
Very clear
Treble?
Sharp and crisp.
Loudness?
You can listen at full volume without much discomfort. But I'd suggest not to.

I compared it with JBL wave tws100. The sound is very similar but a we bit less bass on flat eq.
80% Better than boat airdopes.
30% better than OnePlus bulletsZ.; I will just sum it up, Sony delivers in quality on all fronts, good battery,good bass,clear sound, comfortable, good connectivity,good mic and the sound overall is Rich. Only thing i am concerned about is the quality of material used on wires,very soft and lean, somehow i feel like the material isn't durable even though after almost 4 months, it's still new and strong.; I purchased this item, trusting the brand value of Sony. But so far this is the poorest quality sound I have ever experienced in any earphone. Utterly disappointed. To be honest it sounds like a cheap road side earphone. No bass at all. No high sound even if you keep max volume. Total loss for the amount. I have used Boat and JBL earlier and they are much better compared to this cheap product. Also no magnet for earpieces. Weak quality.; I am an old customer of sony, but I was confused about this product due to the reviews. But it is what actually I want, according to sound it lacks volume but soundstage is good, trebles work perfectly, vocals are clear, bass is soothing and deep. I like the integration of application which tells me my listening hours and set an equalizer according to my preference. I don't know much about DSEE upscaling but it makes a difference, listening to these earphones feels like listening to wired earphones with no lag and weird sound upscaling which other TWS does. Build quality will be a concern for rough users but not for me, it is pretty good for me. The neck part is not stiff which makes it easy to carry. I am a designer, According to a designer's perspective I would it has attention to details like the left and right are separated even with a color difference. Although, I didn't like the long press to change controls system and its not customizable. These earphones are waterproof and have sufficient battery life to support through my busy weeks. Also we can change the language of the instructor of earphones, I chose Japanese because I am a big fan of anime. Also the buds are non magnetic, but it dosen't creates much problem. At last buy these only when you aren't a rough user and wants high volume.; I once carried it in my backpack along with my smartwatch. I don't know if this caused any signal interference but it just doesn't work properly after that. For now, it works if you bring your phone 1 cm close to the antenna (the small rectangular box on the left) but if you place your phone on the table or keep it in your pocket, it stops working. So it's just pointless to use it anymore.

I don't know if this is something common with Bluetooth headphones, neckbands, and all. But I don't think this should have happened. Something is wrong with these products. I'd better stay with wired headphones to avoid the frustration of wireless gadgets.

The sound quality, the app support, the battery and the design are so good. You can buy it if you want a cheap and quality neckband. But just don't keep it near other Bluetooth devices.; Tive dois WI-C200 que duraram 4 anos, √≥timos, e acredito que s√≥ duraram 4 anos porque era usado no sol e no suor.

Exactly what I wanted. Sound is great. They fit well in the ear, and the cable is well balanced, so they don‚Äôt fall out unless they get snagged on something. And the battery seems to last forever. Good Sony quality.; TL;DR: These minimalist headphones from Sony do everything I need them to do, and I can wear them for hours on end with no discomfort.

These headphones are great! For whatever reason, my ears are the wrong shape for many in-ear headphones (""earbuds""), unless they are incredibly small: after about 10 minutes of use, my ears are hurting so bad I can't wear them anymore. I've found that the solution for me is ""neckband"" headphones, where the electronics are stored in the neck band, and the earbuds can be extremely minimal.

These headphones are incredibly light-weight, fit comfortably in my ears, and have enough battery life to get me through any task I've used them for. The microphone is good for phone calls, though it picks up a good deal of background noise (FYI, in case you're trying to talk while you do something semi-noisy in the background). The build quality is all what you would expect from Sony, who have been making consumer electronics as long as I've been alive.

They have no ANC (active noise cancelling), but at the $20 price point I paid for them, that would really have been expecting too much.

The sound quality is GREAT _for what I'm doing_. I mainly listen to podcasts or make phone calls with them. I have only listened to a little bit of music with them, and do not consider myself an audiophile (let's blame minor hearing loss), so I can't comment on the quality of the bass, muddiness, or any of the other audiophile stuff.

My only complaint is that because the ""neckband"" is really just a cord, these can sometimes shift around as you are moving. I'm not sure I could recommend them for doing any kind of bouncing physical activity (plyometrics, cardio, sit ups, etc.) unless you have some way to hold them in place.

Overall I would definitely buy these again, but since they're from Sony I don't expect I'll have to any time soon."

Design and Construction Quality:
The JBL C100SI showcases an elegant, understated design that radiates sophistication. Constructed from durable materials, these earphones blend longevity with a premium touch.

The lightweight design makes these earphones a suitable choice for extended listening sessions, be it during commutes, workouts, or leisure time at home.

At their price range, the JBL C100SI emerges as a compelling option for those seeking reliable, high-quality in-ear headphones.; BUT...>>>>>
Let‚Äôs know about its DURABILITY according to me when using this daily with care. So according to me this product is not durable at all in terms of its poor quality rubber material based CABLE which usually always tends to get tangled and wears out really fast when kept in a bag or a pouch and hence as time goes by it leads to affecting its performance in many ways in the long run and so my review is based on one of the major issues that i faced and so this is how it started..........
So first of all AMAZON is not at all blamed for the fault of this product as they packaged it well and delivered it on time before the expected delivery date and i am completely satisfied with AMAZON & it‚Äôs SERVICES!!!!!
And so it‚Äôs the company that did not design this product to last for more than a year or less than that!!!!!!!!

Anyway I Bought this product on Amazon in the MONTH of OCTOBER in the YEAR 2019 and everything went smooth after opening the package as I enjoyed this pair of earphones so much so that I did not realize that it's cable design, durability and built quality was really poor and hence I kept on using it and it never failed on me and always worked well but all of a sudden in the MONTH of MARCH in the YEAR 2020 which is two months from when i posted my review about this product, i had a major issue and it was that the right earphone all of a sudden stopped working out of nowhere while listening to music one day and later it was discovered by me that it would only work if I keep moving the top cable of the right earphone which is attached the 1 Button Remote With The Microphone and so it would start working and stop working as soon as I let go of the cable and this means that there was some loose connection between the Button Remote and the cable which should not happen as it cost a lot of money and jBL is well known company and they have outstanding products with fairly good prices compared to BOSE which is better but really highly overpriced. So currently I will call jBL CUSTOMER CARE and ask them to resolve the issue by either repairing my earphones or if not repairable that replace it with a new one as its still under its WARRANTY PERIOD!!!!!
So I will put an update as soon as I‚Äôm done solving my issue!!!!!

FINAL VERDICT: IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET WHICH IS BELOW RS 600/- or BELOW RS 700/-
THEN!!!!!
AND ONCE AGAIN ONLY THEN!!!!! GO FOR THIS PRODUCT AS IT‚ÄôS A GREAT PAIR OF EARPHONES UNDER YOUR BUDGET AT A HUGE DISCOUNTED PRICE!!!!!
BUT IF YOU BUDGET IS BELOW RS 1000/- AND YOU LOVE jBL SIGNATURE SOUND THEN GO FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE THE TANGLE FREE CABLE AS THEY WILL DEFINITELY LAST LONGER AS IN MORE THAN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND NOT GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT :)

AND SO GUYS I WOULD RECOMMEND WHENEVER YOU PURCHASE ANY PAIR OF EARPHONES OF ANY KIND OF COMPANY PLEASE DO BUY THE ONES WITH THE TANGLE-FREE CABLE AS I HAVE A PAIR of HEADPHONES WITH A TANGLE-FREE CABLE AND IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 3 YEARS BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO IT AT ALL AND IT STILL WORKS WELL.

SO GO AND GET SOME GOOD PAIR OF EARPHONES if needed AT A VERY GOOD PRICE ON Amazon.in
AS THEY USUALLY PROVIDE GOOD AFTER SALE SERVICES ACCORDING TO ME!!!!!!!!!!

Thanks to all of you who read and understand my review.

Let‚Äôs talk about all important aspects,

Look / feel / comfort:
5 star for all 3.
It is very light weight and cushioning is way better than I expected. The plastic quality is amazing.
The on/off and anc indication lights are bit bright - it gives sort of cheap headphones feeling so I applied a tape to reduce the intensity. The box is also very sturdy and looks good.

Sound :
Bass is quite low but it is there. I am a bass lover but still not disappointed with these as the overall sound is very clear and pleasant.
Turning on the ANC reduces overall bass and gives it a lounge effect (lofi song with normal bass effect) - I like it. If Bass is your priority then this would not be a good buy for you ! You can always install a third party app for equaliser and change it for your preference.

ANC
You can enable ANC anytime. When the headphones are not connected to any device, no music playing, even when the headset is not switched ON. Not all headphones offer this feature.
ANC is not amazing and it doesn‚Äôt block all the outside noise but it‚Äôs quiet unique what I noticed.
If you are listening to Music at volume around 60%+ then the ANC will stop almost all the noise around you and you can enjoy to the music.
If you keep the volume around 50% or less the ANC allows slightly more noise to come in but without bass/ huskyneas to it.
So you can use it as transparency mode with low volume. And at higher volume it works well as ANC.
ANC without music is good when you are walking outside in crowd, it keeps you aware of the surroundings and still keeps the noise down. If you are in a room with few people then you will be able to hear them in a robotic tone but in caf√©‚Äôs with more people - it reduces the noise surprisingly well.
ANC will not disappoint you. I use AirPod pros and I am not disappointed.

Mic
Take calls with ANC ON. It sounds superb. Both the ends - you and the other person gets to hear only vocals and the background noise is gone by 90%.
I tested it on a busy road and the person was able to hear me absolutely clear and so do I with ANC ON. Without ANC ot is okayish.

There are not enough reviews on YouTube for this headset. So, before buying I was not very sure but somehow I ordered them and now I absolutely love them. I assure you if are not a pure bass lover you can go for it blindly.; ANC: Useless. Changes ur perception of sounds/noises around you and also lessens them a bit but it's not significantly positive difference. There is this pressure thing that happens inside ears too due to anc feature. Also, sound quality gets muffled with this feature on so this feature is almost useless.

Battery: Good.

Comfort: Good, pads are great. Not over-ear tho, it's on-ear. But again, pads are sooooooo sooooooft. I can use these while sleeping. Light weight as well.

Build Quality: Looks and feels good, that's all I can say.

Latency of sound: Verrrry less. Lag is not noticable to me at all, pretty good.

Mic: 4/10.

Sound Quality: Bass is good, not exceptional or overpowering or brain rattling or 'EXXTRA', just serviceable. Sound is clear, vocals etc. What these do is not bad at all. Perfectly usable.

Sound is actually really good after you put the headphones on your ears properly.

My recommendation would be a green light. But... buyers can also choose Tribit Tune headphones at this price instead. I haven't tried them but I heard they may have better sound, perhaps. You be the judge. At least their mic is definitely better. I was gonna buy that Tribit one but chose these Boult ones for the looks and ANC. I am not disappointed with Boult, except for mic. Mic is crap.; This headphone is amazing. It is like bringing PVR to home. I want to let you know that I have ordered a second one for my son after hearing its quality. There is no headphone that can match its sound quality, its bass and its volume. But please keep in mind that high frequencies are suppressed (to compare, they are less than 60% of Sony 110A and less than 40% of Sony MDR-XB450AP; I own both of them). But I see this more as a delimitation (designed deliberately) rather than a limitation because at this volume, high frequencies of the level of Sony MDR-XB450AP can blow the ear drums. Even with its current moderated design, I cannot hear it at more than 60% volume on my laptop because the ear drums begin hurting. This level of bass cannot be found in any other brand (as long as I could not find in all the headphones I have used till now). It is perfect for high adrenaline game lovers. My son has loved it and hence my second purchase. I am a ""heavy bass lover"" and hence, this is my kind of headphone.

Update 01: I got my second headphone today. There is no match of its bass quality in headphones of this price range. If you are a real bass lover (and can tolerate really punching bass), this is your kind of headphone. I absolutely love it. Today I experienced one more thing. It creates an envelope of vocals making them match with the bass. The same experience was with mid range sounds (400 Hz to 1 KHz). It however keeps the high frequencies out of this envelope. This is very unique as every song sounds different on this headphone. I am glad that I now own two of this. It is out of market now and hence I feel I am lucky to have grabbed two pieces.

Update 02: I have received my third headphone of this brand; this time for my elder son. He loved it so much that he asked for one exclusively for him. I again repeat my experiences; now that my first headphone is more than six months old. The audio clarity in this headphone is unmatchable especially in the mid range and bass zones. I have several headphones (Sony - 3, Miniso - 1, Zebronics - 1, and Boult - 3). But I enjoy this headphone the most. I have used it continuously at stretch for six hours at 50% volume. The ear does not hurt and the experience is amazing. Even with punching bass, it is so much soothing to the ears as the high frequencies are right-sized. In my view, the available headphones even up to 1K do not match its quality. This headphone is amazing!!"

One of the standout features is the impressive clarity they provide, allowing you to hear even the most subtle details in your music. The sound quality is top-notch, making for an immersive listening experience.
The build quality of these earphones is also noteworthy. Unlike many other wired earphones that feel flimsy and prone to damage, these have a sturdy and substantial cord. This gives me confidence that they will hold up well over time, even with regular use.
Overall, I highly recommend these earphones to anyone looking for a high-quality listening experience without breaking the bank. The combination of excellent sound quality, durable construction, and affordable price make them a smart purchase that is definitely worth the investment.; I am a musician by profession who also produces. I bought these for my son. The positives are build quality, sharpness in the mid and high range, but bass is not good enough to balance it out so it gets a little tiring for long listening as sound is not rounded enough. But I can't really complain because at this price point I don't have the right to. Overall... Go for it. It's sturdy and fits ears perfectly. Blocks all external sound.; This is a great product. It's sound quality, call quality and everything is good. I am not sure about the shortcuts but it doesn't matter that much. But many of you may face a problem. After connecting if earphone logo is not showing in your mobile that means your mobile do not support type-c connectivity devices except charging.
There is a simple solution to this. I cannot guarantee wheather this feature is available in all devices but you can check. After connecting, if earphone logo is not showing, then go to settings, search OTG (under networks and connections,p.b:- may vary device to device) and turn on the OTG option. It should solve the problem. If not then buy another product.; Sound quality is okay but not enough bass compared to other branded products. Then, the build of product is not sufficient as it hampers with comfort in the ears due to the rubber extensions (size optimization is required). Stable for long time use and performance is upto the mark.; Quality is good. Cable is sturdy.
Sound quality is good.
Value for money.; This is the best earphone. 110% reccomend. Using it since last 3-4 years. It's top notch. Everything is top notch. Long life. Good quality. Good sound. Good performance.; I'm so glad that I have ordered that earphones I love the quality of earphone; Pros:

1.Extra Bass Driver: The 10mm extra bass driver contributes to a noticeable low-frequency response, providing a satisfying bass experience for bass enthusiasts.
2.HD Sound: The earphones deliver clear and crisp HD sound, making them suitable for various music genres and multimedia content.
3.In-Line Controls: Convenient in-line controls for playback and call management add to the user-friendly design.
4.Comfortable Fit: The ergonomic design ensures a comfortable fit, suitable for extended usage without causing discomfort.
5.Tangle-Free Cable: The tangle-free cable design helps in reducing the hassle of untangling cords, contributing to overall convenience.

Cons:
1.Build Quality: The overall build quality feels average, with some users reporting durability issues over extended use.
2.Microphone Quality: The microphone quality is passable but may not meet the expectations of users who prioritize crystal-clear call audio.
3.Limited Noise Isolation: The earphones offer limited noise isolation, allowing external sounds to interfere with the listening experience, particularly in noisy environments.
4.Bass Dominance: While the extra bass driver is a highlight, it may overpower other frequencies, leading to a less balanced audio profile for those seeking a more neutral sound.
5.Lack of Extra Features: The earphones lack advanced features such as in-line volume control or noise-canceling capabilities, limiting their versatility."

Your headset is shipped in power saver mode. The headset is only 10% charged. Failure to do so may cause connectivity issues.,"Pros:
1. Really long battery life - one charge would last me a week of regular use.
2. Sturdy build - I move around pretty roughly and the never saw the wires tearing anywhere even after 2 years
3. Decent sound - I am not an audiophile. Don't know much about trebble, bass, highs, lows. The sound was good.

Cons:
1. Once the battery percentage is below 20, you can't listen to music as it keeps shouting ""Oops! Battery low"" every five seconds. This was the most irritating part and kept me wondering why it is even there.
2. It picks a lot of noise while calling if you are in a slightly busy space like office, or road. So not meant for calling
3. The rubber grip that helps to hold it in place came out easily as it would rub against my bag. Since then, I couldn't use it properly as the earphones would fall off.; This is product is very impressive with many fuctions like sound quality and it's durability of battery power. Service is also nice to reach to the customer. At this range they value for your money. Also light weighted product to feel comfortable.; Overall bass and treble balance is good, and music is good. Battery life is excellent, Icharge it once every two weeks. What I don't like is that the right side is heavier than the left side for the additional control switch present, which add to weight. Except this, its a very good product.; Just received the product. Yet to use for some time before I can give a detailed review. At the outset, product seems good. But I was very put off by the poor quality of the USB-C Cable. It does not work. Tried calling Amazon to report this, but only got automated messages with a promise to call back in one minute which did not happen! I hope to receive a replacement USB-C Cable of better quality which works well. This is a small accessory but the poor quality is tarnishing the name of a good brand like BoAT. Very sad!; I am posting this review after i am using ut for 1 month, see everything is good sound, battery, noise cancellation.
But the most worst thing is those 2 hook like structure which makes your earbud fix to you ear sp it won't fall but after 30 min u will feel pain in the where it stucks, and after like 1 hrs it gets worse. So main. Problem is those little outbreak on earpiece.
Rest is good in this price I don't see any change in sound after changing the mode. But everything is balanced.
If you are talking about calling experience it is good not best but good.; 1. The Product Was Good,Without Any Damage.
2. The Earphones Battery Was Insane, Nearly 2Weeks Without Charge.
3. The Earphones Has Good Durability,Water Resistance.
4. The Price Was Really Ok,Good.
5. The BeastXp Mode Was Really Nice,Noise Cancellation Was Good,Low Latency Was Ok.; Durability - The only negative point and the biggest issue is the durability. I bought this neckband in Nov 2023 and in 6 months, one of the ears has stopped working. This is the standard issue of all Boat earphones.
Sound quality - Great sound quality. I can easily differentiate between the different layers of music. Audio is also clear. Never had an issue with hearing. Even the microphone is good.
Battery life - Great battery life! I have charged the band only a few times. Even after using 4-5 hours every day, I didn't need to recharge the battery for the whole week.; Nothing spectacular but will get you through the day. Sound quality is average no noise cancellation but that can go by without noticing . Durability is surely a plus one. Light weight . No complains so far."

If you're buying this by thinking that it would good for gaming purpose than please do not buy this because the sound of gunshots or other activities reaches your ear too late even in its beast mode.

So I had with 0 expectations reading the reviews I got it for a good price at 2800 so i just went for it.
At first when I got the headphones I was dissapointed when I heard coz I put max volume on my phone nd the bass nd sound was low BUT THATS THE MISTAKE I THINK MOST PPL PUTTING THE REVIEWS COZ THATS DEFAULT SOUND which is very low
You will have to put a song or play video it won't work otherwise AND THEN MANUALLY INCREASE THE SOUND BY CLICKING THE VOLUME BUTTONS ON THE HEADPHONES TILL U HERE A SOUND TICK SOUND WHICH MEANS IT REACHED MAX VOLUME.
I did not know this I just found it and UFF the sound and bass increased SIGNIFICANLTY.
SO REMEMBER TO DO THIS THIS WHEN U BUY THE HEADPHONES
After doing that And you still want even more bass and sound then idk do you want ur head to explode or somethin coz it has VERY LOUD AND GOOD SOUND AND BASS!!
OH Yes it's comfortable too not for too long but enough time life 5 or 6 hrs IF u have big ears it might hurt after sometime but for me it's PERFECT.; I have been using the headphones (TUNE 760) for more than a month, here is my review

At first (2 days of purchasing) I was very disappointed because I felt that the sound quality was very lacking, the base and loudness disappointed me, but after a week, it started to sound very very good, I think it needed a burn period, because this headphone is now sounding very very good for me.

Build Quality - the build quality is good, no major issues, the pad is soft.

Comfort - the headphone is comfortable, but one issue is that the clamping force is a bit tight, maybe because I have a big head. Another thing is, even though this is an over read headphone it is not that big, so some part of my ear gets a bit uncomfortable after long use, but if u adjust and find the correct comfortable position, you cab wear it for a long time, I watched a 3 hr movie without any issues

Battery - omg, one of the best part of this headphone, claims 50 hr without noise cancellation, I think it lives upto the mark. You don't have to worry about battery

Sound quality - I'm not an audiophile, let me clear it up. The sound quality I felt was really good and I was very impressed, after the burn in period, so if you are buying this give it at least 1 week before judging it, trust me it really really gets better. The base was not that high, but not lacking also, was upto the mark.

Noise cancellation - it wasn't really that great, could slightly reduce the fan noise that's it, I wouldn't say it is useless, but not that bad either, could reduce the noise of tv from next room when I listened to music, so it did came in handy also with noise cancellation the sound quality I felt improved a bit.

Conclusion - as I said, I was really disappointed at first with the purchase, thought I wasted the money(6.5k) but now I'm really really enjoyed it, watching movies was the best experience with dolby music profile in my phone. I'd say it is really worth the money if ur looking for a headphone around 7k; Pros: good sturdy build and good connectivity and battery life, and aesthetically looks good on you. Active Noise Cancelling is great too.

Cons (likely):

* Charging port doesn't allow for using while charging. I had this in my last headphones (non-brand, cheaper!) and it's so convenient that you miss it and curse whoever is lacking behind in this basic feature. But the good battery backup leaves you plenty time to recharge.

* Too tight. Again, a basic feature IMO to make it feather light which again, a lot of cheaper non-brand headphones are offering, such a shame to see it lacking too. Ears will get hot even in winter/AC. But great if you're a runner, they won't come off.

* Multipoint connection is better than others as it allows you to fully switch between two devices rather divide the audio between calling and music mode. BUT again, the only downside (that maybe only I'm seeing on my Windows PC) that when I switch away from it to my phone, my pc gets entirely disconnected (unlike Android that puts the connection on standby) and I have to re-connect from windows after switching back to it.

* Very little bass. And I feel like ANC might me filtering some of it out, especially at large volume, as the most bass I get at is weirdly at ~80% volume.

Verdict: Well budgeted ANC headphones with lots of good features.; battery and durability -amazing,
sound quality and comfort -great,
noise cancellation -okayish,
mic quality -absolute trash.

all the other reviews speak about the sound quality. it's great in that aspect. nothing special to comment about

These headphones are super tough and last a long time, which is awesome. One thing though, you can't use them while charging, like the Apple mouse. But hey, they charge crazy fast ‚Äì 30-40% in a few minutes, and fully in just 1.5 hours. So, even though you can't use them while charging, you'll be back to wireless mode pretty quickly.

the headphones seem to not have enough processing power to provide good mic quality alongside good sound quality. and when you turn on noise cancelling the mic quality gets even worse. I can't attend calls when im outside, the mic pics up too much noise.

They boot up in noise-canceling mode, which can be useful but drains the battery unnecessarily when not needed. Additionally, they don't automatically power down if noise-cancelling remains active, leading to overnight battery depletion.; Item is good but bass is not as per jbl quality. Further, ear comfort is less. Thank you; These headphones have saved me with the outside disturbance. I purchased it because of Noise cancellation and easy usage. Headphones look classy and the sound quality is amazing. It has both Bluetooth and wired connectivity which comes in handy. Buttons are very helpful to switch from non-NC to NC and even change to next or previous collection. Mic quality works without any disturbance..

Here are the key highlights that make these earphones a fantastic choice:

**Exceptional Sound Quality:** The Bombastic Bass is truly remarkable. Whether I'm listening to music or watching videos, the sound is rich and immersive. The audio clarity and depth are excellent, making every listening experience enjoyable.

**Fast Charging:** The fast charging feature is a game-changer. With just 10 minutes of charge, I get 20 hours of music playback. This is incredibly convenient for someone with a busy schedule. I never have to worry about running out of battery.

**Long Battery Life:** The 30-hour battery life on a full charge is outstanding. I can use the earphones for extended periods without needing to recharge frequently. This makes them perfect for long trips, workouts, and daily commutes.

Overall, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless In-Ear Earphones offer exceptional value for money. They combine excellent sound quality, fast charging, long battery life, and a comfortable fit in a stylish package. I highly recommend these earphones to anyone looking for a high-quality audio experience.; There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.

The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.
Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.

You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.

As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand‚Äôs audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.
If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.

That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.

They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.
The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.; One plus bullet is worth for money. Sound quality is amazing with clear voice feature. Design n material of product is worthy üôå. And got at best of it's price...so definitely no complaint at all.; Been using the Z series past 4 years was quiet satisfied but i was bit spectical about the Z2 ANC in terms of ear fitment and noise cancellation to my suprise its working too good and satisfied with the product and the cost price.; Sound is good everything is alright provided it is hard many times to connect neckband from Bluetooth,either I have to off it or forgot it and pair it again.
Product is of good quality, comfortable in ears and can use easily while doing other activities,battery is okay.Only problem is to connect it from android phone.; I bought this one because of the ANC, and i am quite impressed with the noice cancellation. Eartips are small though but not a problem i can buy it seperately. I was not expecting the sound quality because I use iem earphone as well but the sound quality is quite impressive, best for music like edm mix. Bass is impressive also. Not for music like classical but other than that it is good to listen other genres of music. Connectivity is quite fast and easy and switching between devices as well. Satisfied with battery life as well.; I charge it once a week and it works effortlessly. It‚Äôs very comfortable to use and the neck band is adjustable. I like the quality of sound and would recommend it. I use iPhone and it pairs perfect with it.; Good battery, good sound , call quality nice , gaming not good ,look ok.; The sound quality is very good. The battery life is outstanding. Best of all though is when you click the buds together with their magnets they turn off. Pull them apart and they turn back on. No button to fiddle with. All buds should be like this.; This brand is recognized becaus of the quality of its products and this item is not the exception. perfect for sports and outdoors activities.; La puntualidad, presentaci√≥n me gust√≥ much√≠simo; Good quality, little bigger the end of the neck band because of a bigger battery. Sound and noise cancelation better than previous model. Ear tips smaller and lighter, for me hold really good even running, better bass and treble.; Precis vad jag s√∂kte efter"

BULD:
Out of the box, the build quality is a put off, as the plastic used feels cheap, but that also makes it lightweight. Also, the oversized pleather earpads while very plush and comfortable, are of a very low density foam, and are liable to tear when removed. Clamping force of the headband is on the lower side, which makes the pads comfortable but causes the headband to create a pressure point on the top of my head.

SOUND:
Right out of the box, these cans sounded way too bright and V-shaped for my liking, with the treble being sibilant and harsh. The bass sounded bloated and loose, and the midrange sounded recessed, giving it the impression of a mass-market, V-shaped set of cans.

However, after about 8-hours of burn-in, the SQ improved considerably, with the treble scaling down to relatively tolerable levels, the bass tightening up somewhat to reveal some sub-bass rumble, resulting in some of the midrange emerging from the veil of the bloated bass.

After about 16-hours, I think they have settled down to their designed performance levels with a largely balanced sound signature - although the bass is still a bit hollow, and the treble still has some strident, sibilant peaks.

CABLES:
The 3.5mm-3.5mm cable with in-line mic degrades the sound quality, so to get the optimal SQ, one must use the 3.5mm-6.3mm cable from a single-ended 3.5mm output. Cable quality is just about passable.

PAIRINGS:
Bright/Neutral sources are to be avoided, as it just exaggerates the lurking sibilance in the treble region. This did not sound good with neutral/analytical DAC/Amps like the Earmen Eagle, FiiO KA3, or the Hidizs S9 Pro, and it was only with a relatively warmer DAC/Amp like the Shanling UA2/UA3 that the peaky treble got under some semblance of control.

NOTE:
Standard 100mm replacement pads will not fit these, and I was not able to get a Brainwavz 100mm round pad mounted on this without risking tearing them. These need larger pads like the 110mm Brainwavz XL pads.

SUMMARY:
In many ways, these Monitor 40 headphones reminded me of the Philips SHL3300 - a budget, DJ-style, studio headphone from 2015/15 - an underrated gem from Philips that is still one of my favorite headphones in the sub-5K category - although it was launched way before Philips began making budget audiophile-grade legends like the SHP9500/9600.

Although they were marketed as bassy, DJ-style headphones, in reality, they were surprisingly balanced - with tight, articulate bass, clean midrange, and a smooth, highly resolving, sibilance-free treble. And they retailed for only 2,500/- rupees in India, ($50/- in the US) those days.

The Monitor 40/60 does come close, but still is not as good at detail-retrieval, or as tight and impactful in the bass region, and is nowhere as well built as the SHL3300. Moreover, they are not as resolving or fatigue-free a listen as the Philips.

The relatively cheap build quality, that slightly hollow bass, and that occasionally harsh, sibilant treble are what prevented me from giving these otherwise surprisingly good, budget, DJ-style headphones a 5-star rating.; You can Hear Stuff that you haven't before, you will get Nice immersive experience with it & If you EQ them, then Belive me you will fell in Love with it, I have Oneodio Pro 10, Mid are better on them but overall I will Highly Recommended this headphone, Please EQ them, then Used it (I had attached my EQ Graph); very descent ear experience for home recording & streaming smule, facebook live etc. peope with old age can also use. highly satisfied; got these for djing/mixing music at home because i needed somethint that didnt have all the artificial enhancements my other headset has. First thing I noticed was how crisp and clean the sound is. Second thing I noticed was how I couldnt hear much bads. Third thing I noticed is how much my mixes improved, including the bass due to the clarity of everything. Super comfy and wired so dont need to worry about batteries or software. Folding features are a bit finicky and you will want to be gently, but thats fine for at home for me.; I‚Äôve had at least 15 pairs of headphones in my life. In ear, over ear, on ear, open back, semi open, etc. I‚Äôve never heard anything better.

These 50mm drivers have brightness and clarity like 40‚Äôs, but with the bass reproduction and power of a 50 mm set.

The treble is crisp, accurate, and clear. Even at full send on my iPhone 12, I hear no signs of sibilance. Silky smooth.

The mids are‚Ä¶.I‚Äôve never heard this much space from a headphone. These are NOT open back. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs hard to describe. The separation of spaces and layers in beats is incredible. And this is in RAP. I played ‚ÄúI Want to Know What Love Is‚Äù by Foreigner and almost cried. I‚Äôve played these on every genre I can think of. Electronic, rap, hip hop, rock, alternative, indie, VGM, EDM‚Ä¶just try them.

The bass reproduction is pretty accurate with a tinge of boominess. Any bass lines that aren‚Äôt sub range will smack you in the head. And the subs are soooo articulate and you can really feel them. Full send is gonna make you feel like you‚Äôre in the middle of a party. Play ‚ÄúP Power‚Äù by Gunna.

If I had a minor gripe, it‚Äôd be with how much they swivel. They‚Äôre big and comfortable. Super lightweight.

I haven‚Äôt felt music until I put these on. These are addictive as hell to listen to. The best part? I only have like 6 hrs of burn on them. They‚Äôre only going to sound BETTER. Other companies should be embarrassed. S+ headphone.; Me parecen super c√≥modos y sin duda cumplen con lo que se anuncia, la escena sonora es impresionante, y aun mas por el precio, adem√°s vienen con 3 cables y uno de estos con micr√≥fono, he comprado auriculares mucho mas caros y solo vienen con un cable, los compr√© reacondicionados, estado impoluto, no os dej√©is enga√±ar por las marcas o los precios, los chinos estan dando la calidad y sin alardes; Da kann man nicht mehr schreiben.

La sensazione √® quella di ritrovarsi tra le mani un prodotto comunque di buona fattura ad un prezzo inferiore rispetto alle solite marche note. In dotazione ci sono tre cavi utilissimi come descritto nella scheda prodotto.
Ottimo rapporto qualit√†/prezzo, vedremo se dureranno, la qualit√† dell'imbottitura sembra comunque migliore e pi√π durevole delle mie precedenti sennheiser,pagate lo stesso tanto diversi anni fa, e ora completamente inutilizzabili per via del completo disgregamento dell'imbottitura."

EN RESUMEN: aud√≠fonos con buenos bajos potentes y con sonido claro y si quieres que no se te descargue tan r√°pido el aud√≠fono derecho desactiva el asistente de voz.; Tl;dr - Here‚Äôs what you probably came here to find out:

- Sound quality is phenomenal. Deep bass and rich crystal clear highs. Hands down better than AirPods Pro 2, and significantly so imo.

- Battery life is the longest I‚Äôve ever experienced, once again shaming Apple.

- Noise cancelling is great. For this, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs equal to AirPods Pro 2, if not slightly better.

- They fit very snugly in my ears and don‚Äôt fall out with movement. They come with three pairs of ear tips, each a different size.

- Very good construction and premium feel. They also look really good.

- The charging case can either be charged with a type-C wire, or on any wireless charger by laying them down on the charging pad.

- The Skullcandy IQ app is actually useful with features such as custom EQ, voice control configuration, ANC controls, etc.

Long version:

Borrowed my Wife‚Äôs AirPods Pro 2 off and on for a week before deciding to give these a go as they were 50% off, and as someone who listens to metal and hard rock, these things absolutely murder Apple‚Äôs flagship buds. As far as sound quality and loudness, going from the AirPods Pro 2 to these was like going from ramen noodles to premium ribeye. The bass is right where it should be, and the treble is crystal clear and clean. Loud is an understatement. I use Spotify Premium and am happy with the EQ within that app, but the EQ within the Skullcandy app is really great as well. These are made well and feel great. Battery is roughly 6-7 hours, so really great. They fit great, are very comfortable, and don‚Äôt fall out with movement. All in all, these buds are amazing. Apple can‚Äôt compete.; Bought for my son with sensory needs as they're noise cancelling. We were so impressed with the quality of the sound - definitely on a par with AirPods and half the price!! Excellent value for money - he's always got them in. My brother even purchased a pair because of how good they are for the price point; Super produit, des basses tr√®s solides mais des aigu√´s un peu en retrait, le port est confortable (j‚Äôai les oreilles assez fragiles, la forme s‚Äôadapt√© parfaitement si vous avez des oreilles plis petites que la moyenne).
Les commandes vocales sont un plus, simplement dommage qu‚Äôil faille laisser le logiciel en anglais, une mise √† jour pour l‚Äôutiliser en fran√ßais serait bienvenue !

Unlike ordinary headphones, Pro 10 deliver sound up to 20 KHz for the richest, most nuanced listening experience. Large, 50 millimeter speaker unit drivers combined with neodymium magnets; powerful bass, clear vocal, and crisp high tones form stereo sound.","Top quality product with excellent colourful sound for home entertainment & very comfortable for long hours of listening.
Does a very good job at blocking outside sounds.; The Monitor 40 model does not exist on OneOdio's own website, but going by the specifications, design, and pricing, I am presuming it has been discontinued and is now replaced by the Monitor 60 model.

BULD:
Out of the box, the build quality is a put off, as the plastic used feels cheap, but that also makes it lightweight. Also, the oversized pleather earpads while very plush and comfortable, are of a very low density foam, and are liable to tear when removed. Clamping force of the headband is on the lower side, which makes the pads comfortable but causes the headband to create a pressure point on the top of my head.

SOUND:
Right out of the box, these cans sounded way too bright and V-shaped for my liking, with the treble being sibilant and harsh. The bass sounded bloated and loose, and the midrange sounded recessed, giving it the impression of a mass-market, V-shaped set of cans.

However, after about 8-hours of burn-in, the SQ improved considerably, with the treble scaling down to relatively tolerable levels, the bass tightening up somewhat to reveal some sub-bass rumble, resulting in some of the midrange emerging from the veil of the bloated bass.

After about 16-hours, I think they have settled down to their designed performance levels with a largely balanced sound signature - although the bass is still a bit hollow, and the treble still has some strident, sibilant peaks.

CABLES:
The 3.5mm-3.5mm cable with in-line mic degrades the sound quality, so to get the optimal SQ, one must use the 3.5mm-6.3mm cable from a single-ended 3.5mm output. Cable quality is just about passable.

PAIRINGS:
Bright/Neutral sources are to be avoided, as it just exaggerates the lurking sibilance in the treble region. This did not sound good with neutral/analytical DAC/Amps like the Earmen Eagle, FiiO KA3, or the Hidizs S9 Pro, and it was only with a relatively warmer DAC/Amp like the Shanling UA2/UA3 that the peaky treble got under some semblance of control.

NOTE:
Standard 100mm replacement pads will not fit these, and I was not able to get a Brainwavz 100mm round pad mounted on this without risking tearing them. These need larger pads like the 110mm Brainwavz XL pads.

SUMMARY:
In many ways, these Monitor 40 headphones reminded me of the Philips SHL3300 - a budget, DJ-style, studio headphone from 2015/15 - an underrated gem from Philips that is still one of my favorite headphones in the sub-5K category - although it was launched way before Philips began making budget audiophile-grade legends like the SHP9500/9600.

Although they were marketed as bassy, DJ-style headphones, in reality, they were surprisingly balanced - with tight, articulate bass, clean midrange, and a smooth, highly resolving, sibilance-free treble. And they retailed for only 2,500/- rupees in India, ($50/- in the US) those days.

The Monitor 40/60 does come close, but still is not as good at detail-retrieval, or as tight and impactful in the bass region, and is nowhere as well built as the SHL3300. Moreover, they are not as resolving or fatigue-free a listen as the Philips.

The relatively cheap build quality, that slightly hollow bass, and that occasionally harsh, sibilant treble are what prevented me from giving these otherwise surprisingly good, budget, DJ-style headphones a 5-star rating.; You can Hear Stuff that you haven't before, you will get Nice immersive experience with it & If you EQ them, then Belive me you will fell in Love with it, I have Oneodio Pro 10, Mid are better on them but overall I will Highly Recommended this headphone, Please EQ them, then Used it (I had attached my EQ Graph); very descent ear experience for home recording & streaming smule, facebook live etc. peope with old age can also use. highly satisfied; got these for djing/mixing music at home because i needed somethint that didnt have all the artificial enhancements my other headset has. First thing I noticed was how crisp and clean the sound is. Second thing I noticed was how I couldnt hear much bads. Third thing I noticed is how much my mixes improved, including the bass due to the clarity of everything. Super comfy and wired so dont need to worry about batteries or software. Folding features are a bit finicky and you will want to be gently, but thats fine for at home for me.; I‚Äôve had at least 15 pairs of headphones in my life. In ear, over ear, on ear, open back, semi open, etc. I‚Äôve never heard anything better.

These 50mm drivers have brightness and clarity like 40‚Äôs, but with the bass reproduction and power of a 50 mm set.

The treble is crisp, accurate, and clear. Even at full send on my iPhone 12, I hear no signs of sibilance. Silky smooth.

The mids are‚Ä¶.I‚Äôve never heard this much space from a headphone. These are NOT open back. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs hard to describe. The separation of spaces and layers in beats is incredible. And this is in RAP. I played ‚ÄúI Want to Know What Love Is‚Äù by Foreigner and almost cried. I‚Äôve played these on every genre I can think of. Electronic, rap, hip hop, rock, alternative, indie, VGM, EDM‚Ä¶just try them.

The bass reproduction is pretty accurate with a tinge of boominess. Any bass lines that aren‚Äôt sub range will smack you in the head. And the subs are soooo articulate and you can really feel them. Full send is gonna make you feel like you‚Äôre in the middle of a party. Play ‚ÄúP Power‚Äù by Gunna.

If I had a minor gripe, it‚Äôd be with how much they swivel. They‚Äôre big and comfortable. Super lightweight.

I haven‚Äôt felt music until I put these on. These are addictive as hell to listen to. The best part? I only have like 6 hrs of burn on them. They‚Äôre only going to sound BETTER. Other companies should be embarrassed. S+ headphone.; Me parecen super c√≥modos y sin duda cumplen con lo que se anuncia, la escena sonora es impresionante, y aun mas por el precio, adem√°s vienen con 3 cables y uno de estos con micr√≥fono, he comprado auriculares mucho mas caros y solo vienen con un cable, los compr√© reacondicionados, estado impoluto, no os dej√©is enga√±ar por las marcas o los precios, los chinos estan dando la calidad y sin alardes; Da kann man nicht mehr schreiben.

La sensazione √® quella di ritrovarsi tra le mani un prodotto comunque di buona fattura ad un prezzo inferiore rispetto alle solite marche note. In dotazione ci sono tre cavi utilissimi come descritto nella scheda prodotto.
Ottimo rapporto qualit√†/prezzo, vedremo se dureranno, la qualit√† dell'imbottitura sembra comunque migliore e pi√π durevole delle mie precedenti sennheiser,pagate lo stesso tanto diversi anni fa, e ora completamente inutilizzabili per via del completo disgregamento dell'imbottitura."

Bass is fine but less volume so you need to listen at high sound but you will enjoy.

Mic quality is nice and less disturbance than other earphones go for it.

Just material quality can be better but can not complaint if I see low price I get it for.; Disappointed with the purchase. Right ear piece is not working after 8 days. Please don't purchase it. It's simply not worth it. It didn't even last a month. The volume button is just as how piece. It won't work you know. This company is trying to fool us with their products.; At this price point, this is a good, durable earphones I ever bought! The mic is average and other all controls work fine. The stereo separation is no so good. So, I don't recommend it for gaming or watching movies with Dolby Atmos audio. The sound quality is not up to the mark, the sound is very detailed but i feel like the sound is echoing. First i thought the fault is in my laptop but i face the same problem with the other devices too. Overall, a good earphones at this price point and for regular use.; Purchased: 22 October 2023 | Reviewed: 16 March 2024
I've been using these earphones now since 5 months approx. with both my windows laptop and iphone SE1 and these earphones have been working fine with both, at this price point all I could ask.
The issues I've faced and would like to highlight:
1) I'm doubtful with with the durability/longetivity of these earphones since only after 3 months of purchase (in Dec 2023) the left side earphone stopped working completely on normal regular usage.
2) The volume control and connect/disconnect buttons are compatible with my cellphone iPhone SE1, but not with my windows 11 laptop. But now these also have become irresponsive over the period of 5 months, as now it takes harder to press the button to get a response also sometimes the click registers very late or not at all.
The physical condition of earphones after 5 months of normal regular usage is in the image for your reference. I can assure It hasn't been a rough use at all.; Bass is awesome, quality is worth it I loved it, do try.; Okay Okay Types. I don't think this can be use for longer period as its build is very normal quality. But if you want to have a decent earphone, you can take this.; Don't buy to talk calls.because it's microphone is not good enough I was tested 3-4 pieces but it's doesn't works properly.

If they update microphone quality it will be nice.

The only problem is mic"

1. Really long battery life - one charge would last me a week of regular use.
2. Sturdy build - I move around pretty roughly and the never saw the wires tearing anywhere even after 2 years
3. Decent sound - I am not an audiophile. Don't know much about trebble, bass, highs, lows. The sound was good.

Cons:
1. Once the battery percentage is below 20, you can't listen to music as it keeps shouting ""Oops! Battery low"" every five seconds. This was the most irritating part and kept me wondering why it is even there.
2. It picks a lot of noise while calling if you are in a slightly busy space like office, or road. So not meant for calling
3. The rubber grip that helps to hold it in place came out easily as it would rub against my bag. Since then, I couldn't use it properly as the earphones would fall off.; This is product is very impressive with many fuctions like sound quality and it's durability of battery power. Service is also nice to reach to the customer. At this range they value for your money. Also light weighted product to feel comfortable.; Overall bass and treble balance is good, and music is good. Battery life is excellent, Icharge it once every two weeks. What I don't like is that the right side is heavier than the left side for the additional control switch present, which add to weight. Except this, its a very good product.; Just received the product. Yet to use for some time before I can give a detailed review. At the outset, product seems good. But I was very put off by the poor quality of the USB-C Cable. It does not work. Tried calling Amazon to report this, but only got automated messages with a promise to call back in one minute which did not happen! I hope to receive a replacement USB-C Cable of better quality which works well. This is a small accessory but the poor quality is tarnishing the name of a good brand like BoAT. Very sad!; I am posting this review after i am using ut for 1 month, see everything is good sound, battery, noise cancellation.
But the most worst thing is those 2 hook like structure which makes your earbud fix to you ear sp it won't fall but after 30 min u will feel pain in the where it stucks, and after like 1 hrs it gets worse. So main. Problem is those little outbreak on earpiece.
Rest is good in this price I don't see any change in sound after changing the mode. But everything is balanced.
If you are talking about calling experience it is good not best but good.; 1. The Product Was Good,Without Any Damage.
2. The Earphones Battery Was Insane, Nearly 2Weeks Without Charge.
3. The Earphones Has Good Durability,Water Resistance.
4. The Price Was Really Ok,Good.
5. The BeastXp Mode Was Really Nice,Noise Cancellation Was Good,Low Latency Was Ok.; Durability - The only negative point and the biggest issue is the durability. I bought this neckband in Nov 2023 and in 6 months, one of the ears has stopped working. This is the standard issue of all Boat earphones.
Sound quality - Great sound quality. I can easily differentiate between the different layers of music. Audio is also clear. Never had an issue with hearing. Even the microphone is good.
Battery life - Great battery life! I have charged the band only a few times. Even after using 4-5 hours every day, I didn't need to recharge the battery for the whole week.; Nothing spectacular but will get you through the day. Sound quality is average no noise cancellation but that can go by without noticing . Durability is surely a plus one. Light weight . No complains so far."

Water Resistant: Yes; Design: Canal phone; Headphone Jack: 3.5mm; 6 months warranty,"Bass, noice isolation, appearance, mic quality during call all are well you can go with it without any dilemma.; I recently got my hands on a pair of Samsung earphones, and I have mixed feelings about this product. On the one hand, they excel in terms of features and audio quality, but on the other, their long-term durability is a significant concern when it comes to the wired version.

First, let's discuss the positive aspects. The Samsung earphones come packed with features that enhance the listening experience. The sound quality is impressive, delivering crisp and clear audio across a wide range of frequencies. They also offer great noise isolation, which is perfect for shutting out the outside world and immersing yourself in your music or podcasts.

The earphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods, and they fit securely in your ears, which is a big plus for active individuals or commuters. The in-line microphone and remote control make it easy to manage calls and playback without reaching for your phone, adding convenience to your daily routine.

However, the Achilles' heel of these earphones is their durability, especially when it comes to the wired version. Over time, I found that the wires tend to fray and weaken, leading to audio issues and sometimes complete loss of functionality. It's disappointing to see such a great product compromised by the relatively short lifespan of the wires.

If you're considering purchasing these Samsung earphones, I'd strongly recommend the wireless version for better durability. While they come at a higher price point, they eliminate the wire-related durability concerns and provide a more extended period of reliable usage.

In conclusion, the Samsung earphones offer excellent audio quality and a range of features that enhance the listening experience. However, if you opt for the wired version, be prepared for potential durability issues with the wires over time. For a more lasting and hassle-free experience, the wireless option may be the way to go.; ordered Samsung Original EHS64 Wired in Ear Earphones with Mic & good for daily use.
good clarity for long calls & music. ear buds fit well in ears unlike TWS ear buds which are very uncomfortable. samsung wired earphones are very reliable and much better than many other brands.
however, it does not have any noise cancellation. mic quality for calls is loud and clear.; The sound quality is very nice . Overall good.; This is not same Ehs64 model. Old Ehs64 version was far better than this new version headphone. Quality is different, bass is low, vocals are not crisp than old ehs64. Old ehs64 origin was china. This new is made in Vietnam totally not best. Good for normal user. Old was good in every segment like low, mids and high. Since 2013 still working fine without any problems, no one can beat this headphone in terms of sound quality, but this new version is not my taste. Not bad but not best.; Worthy product, travel friendly.

From its stylish design to its outstanding audio performance, it has exceeded my expectations in every way.
Design and Build:
The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek and modern design of the Boat Neckband. The combination of black and silver accents gives it a premium look, and it's incredibly lightweight, making it comfortable to wear for extended periods. The flexible neckband design ensures a secure fit around my neck, even during rigorous workouts or when I'm on the move.

Sound Quality:
The sound quality of these neckbands is nothing short of exceptional. The Boat Neckband delivers rich, clear, and well-balanced audio. The bass is punchy without overpowering the mids and highs, allowing me to enjoy a wide range of music genres with utmost clarity. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tracks or taking calls, the audio quality is consistently impressive.

Battery Life:
One of the standout features of the Boat Neckband is its impressive battery life. I can easily go through several days of moderate use on a single charge. This is incredibly convenient, as I no longer have to worry about constantly recharging them, making them perfect for long trips or days filled with back-to-back meetings.

Connectivity:
Pairing the Boat Neckband with my devices is a breeze. The Bluetooth connectivity is stable and quick, and I've had no issues with dropouts or disconnections. The device also has a decent Bluetooth range, allowing me to move around my home without losing connection quality.

Comfort and Convenience:
These neckbands are designed with comfort in mind. The earbuds fit snugly in my ears, and the neckband doesn't cause any discomfort, even during extended wear. The in-line controls are intuitive, making it easy to adjust the volume, change tracks, or take calls without reaching for my phone.

Call Quality:
The built-in microphone provides crystal-clear call quality. I've had numerous conversations, and the person on the other end has always reported that my voice comes through loud and clear, even in noisy environments.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Boat Neckband has proven to be an excellent investment. It combines style, comfort, and exceptional sound quality into one impressive package. Whether you're a music enthusiast or need a reliable hands-free calling solution, these neckbands deliver on all fronts. I wholeheartedly recommend the Boat Neckband to anyone in search of a top-notch wireless audio experience.; Noise cancellation ok, battery is good, sound quality ok, ok; Not worth for money. Can't hear clear sound and base; The two device pairing and simultaneous use on both the devices is a great feature when you don't want to constantly change devices using button or something. The sound quality is also excellent for the price. There are still two things that bother me. The feature of magnetic bus is kinda a gimmic, it doesn't turn the earbus on or off. But the feature of two device simultaneous pairing make up for it. Sometime when I turn the earphone on it doesn't seem to connect to my phone instantly, I have to manually do it and in other cases it perfectly does that. The other thing is build quality is okay, but can't argue for the price it's good enough. Only if they used rubberised plastic instead of textured one, would've had a better feel to it.; Less battery life; Been using it since a week and they're really comfortable. I got it delivered in two days without delivery charge and it's worth spending ‚Çπ1000 on. It's quality is really good. It has great battery life too since I noticed that it charged up in an hour and works for like 30 minutes with no disturbance.; A very good neckband with good sound quality and connectivity is also good.; This is so good but not well"

Your headset is shipped in power saver mode. The headset is only 10% charged. Failure to do so may cause connectivity issues.,"; If you are willing to buy this Earbud just read my honest review about this product!

Worts product. I purchased it in the sale for 599rs and as mentioned.. it has BT 5.0, etc. features! All are fake not even a single thing is true! but instead, it has these cons below.

1. Bad Connectivity, Bad Range (Probably BT 2.0 or worse)
2. Below Average Bass and Treble.
3. Not Good For Calling as well! (The other person can't hear you clearly)
4. Charges fast but could not last 3 days or so while keeping it unused.
5. You have to turn it on manually every time you keep it in the box, by touching and holding the back of it.

THE WARRANTY CLAIM PROCESS.

So it came faulty in the first place but I keep using it because I had a warranty of a year.

THE FAULT - its right bud had less noise as compared to the left one.

So I started using it I managed to hear the unbalanced sound problem for a month and after 2 months I went to the Ptron service center to replace it, they replaced it after a week of time they took for the warranty claim but before the warranty claim you have to mail the Ptron care and register the complaint first then they will send you the Ticker number of your product then you have to keep it and shot it to the customer service executive then they will replace it in the warranty.

so after it got replaced I faced an even worse problem than I had before with my first product!
this product that they have replaced was renewed and it came sealed! (I figured after a few days)
Then when I paired these buds they started giving audio stutters.. wtf? I have replaced it with a new one and I got an even worse product It will not give you constant audio output always stutters in the audio no matter how close your device is.

then I went to the service center and told them that this was not working properly I couldn't even hear the sound! I want to replace it again. then the female executive said that you can only replace it once!
I was like wtf? This is a total scam that Ptron is doing.. and this was the worst product that I have ever purchased I should have gone for Boat instead I still regret buying these earbuds and it's still in warranty by the time I'm writing this review and its unusable as they refused to replace it as it still has 6 months warranty left. :) SHAME ON THIS COMPANY. DON'T BUY THEIR PRODUCT."

The battery is very good but the charging cable is very short in length.
Built quality is very good feels premium. It's quite smaller than expected and I faced but fitting issue it's quite loose on my head
Connectivity is very fast & Dual Pairing.

Overall I'm satisfied because these days good headphones at affordable range rarely exist. This headphone completes my need of a portable and folding headphone with long lasting battery. The only issue which I found is the sound leakage rest is fine.; I've been using these headphones for a while now. The build quality is excellent and they're definitely not as heavy as some of the other reviews suggest. They're a little tighter around the ears, but that's not a problem for me. It helps with the passive noise cancellation, which is cool. The sound quality is quite good, and listening to music on these is a lot of fun. You can tweak the sound using several equalizers in the app. Keep tweaking until you find what works best for you. These headphones can also be used to consume media other than music, such as videos. The headphones come with Bluetooth 5.0 and AUX support in case you run out of battery. So far, I haven't had any problems with the connection. It's stable and works well when you move around a bit. The battery is the best thing about this product. It easily lasts well over a week on one charge, which is great because I use it every day. So far, I've been really pleased with this product. They're a little pricey, but they're definitely worth it!; The fit is good. Sound quality is outstanding also build quality is premium very comfortable.; These are absolute steal in this price! The design, colour, sound quality and battery life are amazing. The battery life is actually super amazing! I use them for 5 hours straight and the battery doesn't even drop down 1% which is mind boggling. For someone like me who listens to music for long hours, the battery life is a blessing. My head is a little sensitive so it starts hurting though, otherwise I can wear them for 10 hours straight. I got these on 11th May and Today is 18th may. I recieved them at 40% that I have charged them only once till 80% and used them continuosly everyday. I still have that 80% battery left. The colour is beautiful. The sound quality is really nice for the price range. Better than Boat ones for sure! The bass and the treble is perfect. The music feels heavenly at 80% volume. Even though the body is plastic, it feels premium. I was doubtful about this colour due to lack of photos and reviews but I am super glad I went for these, they look classy! Calling is also much better than the boat ones I had earlier. All-in-all, you will not be disappointed after using these.; Fast charging and long-lasting for me cuz I dont use it continuously all day
Sound wise its good
Quality of the product top notch. Came with dust bag,2 types of charges cable and leather quality is sooo goood and soft and it doesn't affect the ears but it will if u gonna use for a long time like any headphone does .
Calls -I dont think its good, the other person can hear you only if there is no distractions like fan and background noises and ull hear all the background noise when ur listening to songs.
So I think there is more options out there for this price so look for other options.; After using completely for 2 days (only removing it for sleep), i can say that sound quality is really good, the sound mixing is good and the overall sound feels dynamic but it causes pain after an hour or two. Then, there is significant sound leakage when the volume is above 80.

i was listening to music, when my parents was sleeping, they literally woke up due to sound leakage from the headphone. To give perspective, when the headphone is listened on max volume, outside people can hear it as sound 20 or 30. This is bad....

So buy this if u want an good looking headphone with good sound output but remember the cons: heavy, can't wear it for long hours, sound leakage

i am thinking of returning it.. to get a over the ear headphones; ; Buenos aud√≠fonos, calidad en el sonido y en el volumen. Por el tipo de aud√≠fono no ofrece un aislamiento completo del ruido pero la esponja hace muy bien su trabajo para camcelqr sobresalientemente el ruido exterior.
Una ventaja es que son Muy ligeros y c√≥modos por lo que puedes usarlos durante mucho tiempo si. Que sean molestos por el peso o que lastimen la cabeza y orejas.

La mayor ventaja que le veo es el aplicaci√≥n que se puede descargar para configurar el tipo ecualuzacion que se desea dependiendo del g√©nero.; The bass boost on these are crazy. They do cinch to your head nicely where they won't fall off so easily like other headphones I've had. They charge pretty fast and the battery life for me last a while because I'm a music fan so I love to listen to music for hours on end. I think it's a good value I wish they were a little bit cheaper but they are definitely a good deal and they do go wherever you go bluetooth availability and it also has an aux cord just in case. I love them. And the color is a plus as well also the cushioning on the ear portion is soft it does get a little sweaty though. Also they are very loud which I love as well and they are noise canceling.; I have been a fan of Anker cords so when I found nd myself looking for a set of headphones, these stood out to me. the reviews were good, the battery life promise kind of hooked me and so I thought I'd give them a shot. I was not disappointed! The sound is amazing compared to ones I have used before. The ear pads are smaller than full coverage so they aren't the best for noise cancelling (but somewhat). They connected very easily and feel nice on my ears. The battery life is amazing. I have charged them in the week or so since I got them but only because of habit (my old ones could barely go a day).
The one problem I have with them is they feel wide and big on my head and I wish I could make the adjustable band a bit smaller to be more snug on my head. I just have a small head so if you have a large one, great, lol!
Anyway, I'm impressed and hope they last me for a long time to come.; Der Klang dieses Kopfh√∂rers ist gut - aber auch nicht mehr. Es fehlt etwas an Klarheit, daf√ºr ist die Lautst√§rke sehr gut und der Bass abartig - und f√ºr mein Empfinden viel zu viel wenn man den Bass-Boost aktiviert. Der Tragekomfort ist ok, wenngleich dieser Kopfh√∂rer schon deutlich auf die Ohren dr√ºckt. Die Bluetooth Verbindung und Reichweite ist tadellos, die Akku-Laufzeit exzellent.
Das Beste aber an dem Kopfh√∂rer ist das wirklich exzellente Preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis: All das um nur EUR 20.- ist nat√ºrlich der Hammer - deswegen trotz der angef√ºhrten Mankos 5 Sterne.; Amazing quality, amazing sound, beautiful clear microphones, lovely bass, unmatched battery life, fits well and easy to setup, as an audiophile who has owned over 20 pairs of headphones, at this price point, they are unmatched, with an amazing free app that syncs your equaliser settings between devices"

They offer all the important features like Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), spatial audio, and good battery life. The app support is excellent, and the build quality is very good.

The ANC is awesome, and the sound quality is impressive. For gaming, it provides low latency modes, which is great. The sound quality is great with various modes to choose from. You can clearly separate out all the vocals and instruments, and the bass does not overpower anything. Overall, these earphones provide great value for the price and have been a fantastic choice for me.; After six months with the Realme Buds Wireless 3, they prove to be a budget-friendly choice with decent performance. The sound quality is good for its price range, offering clear highs and balanced mids. The battery life is impressive, lasting up to 20 hours on a single charge. The lightweight and comfortable design make them suitable for extended use. However, the bass can be underwhelming for bass-heavy genres, and the Bluetooth connection occasionally drops. The in-line controls feel a bit flimsy. Overall, these headphones are a solid choice for casual listeners seeking affordability and comfort.; Ok so this is the review after a day of usage as i will devide this review in parts so I can explain everything...

Battery:- As I said I got this earbuds yesterday and battery percentage was 80% I didn't charge it and used it around 12 hrs but today its showing 30% I am a Heavy user for earbuds but battery is amazing if you charge it once you can easily use this for 3-4 days I am satisfied

Build:- At first glance it looks shiny plastic build but when you hold it in your hands you will feel the qualty and hardness of the earbuds as well as wires. In 1700 the build is great it's justifies the price the buttons are steady and properly working just one issue that after a long time of use I feel slight pain in my left year but may be it is just me. Also these earbuds are very easy to carry in pockets so don't worry the material is very flexible and strong

ANC:- ANC is pretty descent I never used any earbuds before having any ANC features(previously I used Boat Nirvana ION) it's my first time using it and its good I mean in bus or train it will gonna help me to get rid of unwanted sounds to be honest it cuts 30-40% of outside sounds its descent.

Sound Quality:- Guyz TBH The Sound Quality is amazing let me explain it in detail. So vocals are crystal clear no issue in that. The trebles are amazing. I mean when you listen the songs you will gonna notice all kinds of instruments that are used in the music and also all the small small details you will definitely going to hear those too. I mean the sound seperations are just on point in this price. Let's talk about BASS and if you are a BASS lover just buy it. I am a Basshead I love Extra boosted heavy BASS and these earbuds are made for it. Also you can customise the soundtype in app settings so don't worry... overall its best in sound quality I am in love with this earbuds.

App:- As I mentioned earlier that this earbuds supports realme link app which means there are a lots of customizations which you can do in the app such as there are 4 eq modes
1. Vocals: Basically focuses on movie or videos or if you joined classes using this its good.
2.Original sound: In this mode the music will feel flat with no base but clear audio.
3.pure bass: This is the same as original sound but with bass which I am using it will give clear vocals thumpy bass and amazing trebles.
4. Deep Bass: in this mode the Bass will going to takeover the vocals and trebles and all you can feel is Heavy BASS.

There are more features like You can customize the Bass by activating the Bass function, You can turn on ANC, Transperancy or Off the ANC in the app.

Spatial audio: Sometimes it can create a good 3d surround sounds but not everytime so its just 50-50 like watching movies in this mode will give you a good experience.

Game mode without the game mode you can feel the latency but after turning it on the latency reduces if you are a casual gamer and play games for fun I mean daily 2-3 hrs of gameplay just to enjoy with friends and hangout with them you will going to enjoy it but if you are looking for professional gaming this is not the right one for you.

Extras:- it has bluetooth 5.3 and magnetic off and on feature which I am loving in this as soon as you seprate those earbuds it will get connected instantly that's good I have used Boat nirvana ION and I lost the case and I bought this and one thing I can say that this is far better then those the sound quality build features ANC as well as in everything if you are buying it don't think just trust me you never going to regret.... IT'S THE BEST EARBUDS IN MARKET RIGHT NOW!!!!; I recently bought the Realme Wireless Buds and I'm impressed. The sound quality is excellent, with clear highs and punchy bass. They're very comfortable, and the multiple ear tips helped me get a perfect fit. Battery life is solid, The quick charge feature is handy. Connectivity has been stable and the touch controls are intuitive. Overall, they offer great value for the price and are a fantastic option for budget-friendly wireless earbuds. Highly recommended!; Overall, the product is value for money which comes with the best sound, ANC, Dual device connectivity and built quality, but the earpieces cannot be the most comfortable and can also cause pain for the people with small ears, I checked on internet about this problem and i found that many other customers also feels the same so I will suggest that one should consider about this before buying Realme Buds Wireless 3 in-Ear Bluetooth Headphones,"

Huge Sound stage, amazing imaging. It can be super intimate or huge sounding depending on the track.
Tight impactful bass, not even remotely sloppy.
Super detailed mids, they are insane...
Detailed treble but less harsh of treble compared to the Arya V3 Stealth and Arya Organic. Plus you get a better warranty (2 years) vs 1 with the arya line. Also the headband is higher quality and overall build quality is a noticeable step up vs the Arya line.

They really sound high end and so satisfying to listen to...my endgame headphones!; Very good sounding and extremely well designed headphones. Best at this price range.; Even without any EQ, these have a very pleasant tonality and a very satisfying bass, better controlled and with better slam than the Audeze LCD-2 Classic. Compared to the Sennheiser HD800S, I can hear much more detail in the textured sounds such as the shaker that starts at 2:47 in Nextra by Deadmau5 or in the guitar from Yellow by Coldplay.

What I don't like about them is the unit variation. I heard two pairs which were new, one of them was flawless and the other one had very weak bass which didn't improve even after a week of burn-in. Eventually I returned both pairs and got an HE1000se, which has a slight boost in clarity over the Stealth, at the cost of some reduction in bass volume.; E' stato scritto di tutto su questa magnifica cuffia di HIFIMAN, sia commenti appropriati che esagerazioni.

After about half an hour of burning the headphones in with some 24bit Flac songs i went ahead to test it.

Played multiple songs and movies via the Walkman , X3 amp , Note 9 phone.

First impressions:

Build : The build quality is excellent, it's all plastic that seems like it is made to last and keep it light for comfort. The mechanism also feels reliable.
So 5/5

Comfort:
Very good , not fatigued after 1 hour , No unwarranted peaks in any frequencies.
Its winters here in the north so it also doubled up as a scarf insulating my ears from the peircing cold.

Sound isolation:

Well what would one expect from an open back , it's terrible.
But it is what it is.
You have to be alone and in a quite environment to listen to these.
Sound will leak both ways.

Package contents:
Well the box that comes with it is unimpressive, it is a waste like soft cardboard box which is labeled as ""frustration free"" packaging, it's all nonsense.
If it was a good quality box one would use it to keep the headphones after use safely,and won't throw it away.
No i will have to purchase a headphone case adding more to the environmental damage.
You get two cables one being a 6mm and one 3.5mm with a 6mm to3.5mm converter plug.
Sennheiser took good care in that area.

Sound :
Well i come from using the following in order of magnitude

Most vintage models of Sony tape walkman headphones and earphones
Mdr xb 60ex
Mdr xb500
Mdr xb 90ex
Mdr xb 75ap ( Skull rattler )
Mdr ex220
Asus rog headset
Xba H3 ( My personal favorite in all areas )
Shure se 846 ( Skull breaker , My almost perfect set but gets beaten in High frequency department)

As you can see there is only two over the ear headphones.
Now i have always been disappointed by the music of over the head headphones due to lack of proper Isolation and driver limitations.

Being my first open back This HD559 is no different to closed back in music department.

Music coming out of it is unimpressive , you get almost no proper bass rumbles in the tracks that have them but maybe it's my fault.
(more on that later).
The soundstage although quite good does not impress you enough to warrant the sacrifice in sound isolation and lower frequencies.
Sometimes some songs get tinny and empty, sometimes they come out good but never great.
Apart from that i maybe wrong with my eqs and settings i will update after a week of listening.

Movies : WTF
This has blown all my in ear headphones far away , nothing comes close to the immersive theater like experience while pairing it with the X3 amp and switching on the xfi.
You are instantly placed in a premium position of a proper dts tuned theater seat.
All the action is all around you and dialog of the actors are clear and crisp even during intense explosions and gunfire.
Things are properly imaged bodies dropping to the ground , bullets whirring past you thunders in the sky everything is represented perfectly.
Imaging is more vertical than horizontal.

Now the bass : While the music had no bass on it , on movies while on xfi turned on the bass reaches skull rattling levels without getting distorted or overlapping any other frequencies.
It is unreal and brings a huge smile on your face and the only reason i did not return these back.
The explosions shake you bullets fired seem real , thunders are near to being real.

For movies this is the ultimate solution for me the END GAME so to say.

Haven't tested it yet on games but have heard quite a praise for them in that regard.

Conclusion:

These mysterious headphones struggle to pump up the proper bass notes on music but will pummel your head in movies.
Maybe i am doing something wrong on my amp but i have tried to bring it on the music by various ways.

The world shattering bass is there waiting to be unleashed but with mysterious ways.

The mids are perfect for both Male and females all the frequencies are present and quite powerful.

The highs are a bit laid back and roll off at the highest levels quite quickly , whenever you will need them desperately they will bail out on you.
But overall they are fine.

Is it worth the money ?.
For movies absolutely. 100%
For music Maybe
For games , haven't tested yet but i am confident they will excel in that department.

Very good product.
Highly satisfied.; I bought these in Aug ( about 5 months back), so a long term review ig?
tldr: I Have absolutely loved them since the day I received them and highly recommend for the open back option!
PS: the open back hype is real guys, there is a huge difference
Prior to buying them I had tried the:
1. Sony XM300 - great comfort and noise cancellation - hated the sound, found it too bassy
2. AKG MX50 - didn't find anything great about the sound, the build quality was amazing, the earcups didnt go over my ears, sorta stayed on top of them
3. Some IEMs - great for the price but very unreliable, usually not comfy

So going into this my priority was straight - No compromise on sound, neutral sound (tho, if needed prefer bass over sparkle), good build quality, well known brand that has good warranty, price/performance ratio
Note: I didn't care about the sound cancellation as I live in a fairly quite place

For what I wanted, these are perfect in every sense. The sound signature is close enough to the HD6XX series while being almost half the price (in India atleast), the comfort is top notch even with specs, not too bassy while still being enjoyable in songs that need bass (a bit warm, great for long sessions), the tremble has never pierced my ears.
Only downside I see is, i wish they were more portable.; I primarily bought this for competitive FPS gaming, Modern Warfare, CS:GO, The Finals and the likes of it. I also listen to good music and here's my review:

-Outstanding Soundstage
-Imaging is very accurate
-Drivers are well tuned and are on the neutral side.
-The bass is perfect for an openback headset, although some might argue that it's sometimes a bit more overwhelming sometimes.
-Overall the robust quality, comfortable over the ear fit makes it wearable for long gaming sessions.

Very happy with the purchase, HD599SE is a good gaming companion and is very good for Movies and Music too.; O fone √© leve confortavel, som execelente , para quem gosta de uma boa musica e assitir um seriado.Tenho varios fone de ouvido, mas este vai ser aquele de cabeceira , uso para tudo. fantastico.; Son maravillosos, de eso o hay duda: Excelente extensi√≥n musical, excelente soundstage; tienen mucho cuerpo (Raz√≥n por la que quer√≠a unos aud√≠fonos circumaurales open back); al ser abiertos no hay rebotes de audio, no se como se le dice pero no retumban en la cabeza como con unos cerrados; su fuerte son sin duda los graves, eso si, por el contrario pecan en los agudos, sin embargo no es algo malo, si uno viene de aud√≠fonos m√°s comerciales son muy c√°lidos de escuchar y sobre todo c√≥modos, pero si uno ya es audiofilo reacio, probablemente no les guste tanto porque no son planos, a mi por otro lado, me encantan, era justo lo que quer√≠a. Tambi√©n me gustar√≠a mencionar que si que necesitan un poco de amplificaci√≥n, no solo por los 50 Ohm's, en general se oyen mejor con una amplificaci√≥n dedicada.; The quality of these exceeds anything I had before! Though, being open-back, they're not suitable to use in work/public spaces.

An Apple USB-to-3.5mm dongle makes them even better.; Je re-d√©couvre certains morceaux de musique de mani√®re plus complexe, plus compl√®te qu'avec mon ancien casque filaire !

- Call quality is excellent plus it cuts off ambient noise while you are talking which is great. So if you are into taking lot of calls then this is the perfect choice as it keeps you focused as well ensures the quality of your voice renders perfectly to the listener on the other side.
- Looks modern and sleek.
- ANC is really good with choice of setting the level unlike QC35ii where there is zero, mid, high with NC700 you can choose individual range for what is low what is mid and high.
- Ear pads are really of great quality and fit perfectly
- Sound quality is balanced renders natural sounds without adding too much of effect but if you like thump then may not be the best one out there.
- Touch controls are really good esp to pause by just double tapping is really neat
- Putting it in the case is pretty easy unlike the foldable qc35ii. I've read reviews where people preferred foldable ones but in my personal preference keeping it in the box is pretty easy compared to qc35ii where you had to figure out which side to fold and then take care while putting it in the box that you have used the padding perfectly.

Cons
- The metal band makes it a little heavy compared to qc35ii and you can feel it during the initial use but will get used to it.
- Butons are very flimsy and don't give the feel as qc35ii controls, they have tried to make them small and sleek but in doing so have made them really to thin and looks to be of cheap quality
- Not much difference in sound quality compared to qc35ii so not a big upgrade if you are planning for.
- Pairing with the app to start using it.; Build quality is very good. Sound is just super, I personally like balnced bass and optimized for all sorts of sounds. It serves that purpose. Yeah, price little high but over all product is good. One thing is, AUX cable they designed like, headphone side 2.5 mm and other side 3.5 mm jack. May be they wanted to use only their accessories :); Immaculate sound quality, great build, fabulous ANC - an all-round winner!; Astounding noise cancellation, beautiful design and poor quality software support.

1. The noise cancellation is unrivalled. A truly worthy competitor in this field. Compare it with the world‚Äôs topmost racing cars in the field of noise cancellation.

2. It looks and feels like a piece of modern art. If you have an eye for sleek design, minimalism and ‚Äúless is more‚Äù thought process, you would appreciate these. Pitch it against any other headphone in the market side by side, and you could see the difference in build quality and design superiority.

3. Software. Bose should fire at least half of its software engineering people. Looks like Bose doesn‚Äôt quiet really know what Quality Software means in 2021. Buggy iOS app, pathetic support site etc. it looks like Bose spent a ton of money in hiring top notch UI/UX designers and cut corners by hiring stupid and cheap app developers. The can‚Äôt be said to be reliable at all. It looks like force fit component in an otherwise beautiful and rock solid product which is worthy of being put at MOMA (Museum of Modern Art). I am guessing Bose relies heavily on third party software developers who don‚Äôt have any idea of what a ‚ÄúBose‚Äù product really means and who the ‚ÄúBose‚Äù people are. In all, software is a huge let down.

4. Innovation and features. The world has made major technological advancements extremely fast and Bose seems still locked in its own research labs and in their ivory towers. Why Bose? Why the attitude? Why are you not adopting the best codecs available out there? Who says you have to clutter your product? Look at Sony and Apple and learn from their best success. Don‚Äôt think that you can remain hidden in your own research labs and can do all the innovation yourself. Because, a day might come, you will be paying a heavy price for this. If you don‚Äôt innovate and compete, you will die.

Summary:
This product would have been an undisputed leader 3 years ago, but not right now. Sorry Bose, others like Sony and Apple have worked very very hard and they deserve the respect and the market a bit more than you for this product.; Awesome noise cancelling headphones ever; It's just been 1 day since I received them and I can't get over how sturdy, compact and beautful these are. Having worn it for more than an hour, I felt no discomfort at all. Its multi-device connection also works well - it's connected simultaneously to my laptop and mobile.; Son unos aud√≠fonos incre√≠bles con una gran cancelaci√≥n de ruido , tambi√©n cubren bien los o√≠dos y son c√≥modos , las personas de cabeza grande no tienen nada que tener , yo los compr√© por qu√© quer√≠a unos que cubrieran el o√≠do completo , fueran c√≥modos y de gran calidad de materiales y estos lo son; Love everything about the headphone/headset.

The bluetooth connectivity is breeze and the sleep/wake up mode is really fast and accurate as it detects the headset being worn.

The only con i have is the battery life lasts for a day and required to be charged. But it is not a deal breaker.

I use this more for Microsoft Teams call or phone call, the audio is crystal clear and the mic is pretty good.

The NC is definitely very good for the cost of the headphones.; These are not perfect as headphones go, but they are literally the nicest noise cancelling headphones that any amount of money can buy. They have their ups and downs. I'm going to talk in depth about each of these, but overall these are the best noise cancelling headphones money can buy, so even when it comes to their downsides, you can't do better.

First, if you're a regular consumer, you'll be blown away by the sound quality. However, if you're an audiophile used to audiophile grade open back headphones like the Sennheiser HD800, these fall short of audiophile levels of sound quality. Let me explain why that is.

Sound quality wise, the sound quality is overall spectacular, but it has two problems. Bass is way overemphasized, and the treble is rolled off. The treble issue is in my opinion the only really major flaw you have to deal with in these headphones. It's really a shame. Even with EQ, there's no good way to make up for the treble problem because the high end is just always a little lacking.

Bass is massively overemphasized, but everyone seems to do that these days, and most people seem to love it. Thankfully, you can just lower the bass in the EQ and it works fine, but from an audiophile perspective it's still a mark against it. You can also raise the bass if you want to lose your hearing and cause brain damage from the thump. These things will thump so hard that it'll give you a concussion.

Aside from those two downsides, instruments sound absolutely spectacular with amazing definition, separation, and clarity, it's just really unfortunate that they rolled off the treble. It'd be nice if the bass wasn't so overemphasized, but the bass at least is understandable since it seems to be what most people want. I will say however that the mid is absolutely spectacular, so there's that.

Even at their best, if you're a real audiophile, these don't hold up to the sound quality of high end audiophile open back headphones by Sennheiser like the HD650 or HD800. These are consumer grade, very top end consumer grade, but they don't reach the heights of real audiophile territory. For most people though, these will blow you away.

Noise cancelling wise, these are the best money can buy. I've tried other noise cancelling headphones, and these destroy everything that I've ever tried. It's a night and day difference in terms of the overall quality and effectiveness of the noise cancelling compared to other noise cancelling headphones.

However, they're not totally perfect. I have a bunch of air filter fans running full blast all the time, and it reduces their volume by 90+%, but it's a little inconsistent. Some of the inconsistency comes from just how the headphones sit in my head, if I get them just right, it mutes probably 98% of the sound, but if they're just a little off, it drops to between 90-95%. Sometimes it just seems to work better than other times with no apparent explanation. 90% is still a ton of noise reduction. Be aware though that you can still hear things, they're just quiet. Like if you pass a fan while walking, you can still hear it, it's just quiet.

There is sometimes a slight amount of pressure from the noise cancellation, but it's very minimal, and a lot of the time there's actually none.

Next, we get into the real premium stuff. You're paying like $400 for this, so let's talk about what you're really paying for: the creature comforts and luxury that get overlooked at lower price ranges...

For example, the case for these headphones is simply amazing. It feels extremely premium, it has a nice touch, it's light but durable, it has this lovely leathery material that is a joy to hold. It just feels like a million bucks. Even the zipper is nice! The internal layout is likewise spacious, protective and just overall very high quality.

Same with the headphones themselves. As an object that you hold in your hand, these things simply feel incredible. They're unbelievably light, I don't know how they made it feel this light. The headband literally feels like a cloud, it almost melts in your hand. I've never felt anything like it. It is insanely soft with this beautiful smooth leather feeling, yet it doesn't collapse when you wear it. I don't even understand how that works, but it does.

These are the most comfortable set of headphones I have ever put on my head by far. It feels like you're wearing a cloud. It's crazy. The clamp force is so low that I can wear these for hours and hours on end and they just feel insanely comfortable the entire time.

Even just holding these headphones physically, they feel like a million bucks. Like they've got these buttery smooth moving collapsible cans, yet they feel solid and durable, and they have this lovely smooth feeling to them.

These are the things you're really paying for when you pay $400. It's just all those little details and luxuries that really make it. They put a lot of luxury into the things outside the actual speakers, and it shows. They feel super premium in your hands, they're a beautiful shape, they're insanely comfortable to wear, they have this elegant simple design to them, and their case is outstanding. Seriously, if you hold the case and headphones of any of the other noise cancelling headphones in your hands, they just don't feel as nice as this.

Overall, I really wish they hadn't rolled off the treble. That's its one major flaw. However, these are so good that I can't go back to anything else (other than my open back audiophile sennheisers for serious listening). These are like the ultimate casual headphones for every day use. Watching TV? Use these. Going on an airplane? Use these. Going to the gym? Use these. Going for a walk? Use these. Unless all you want to do is sit down and seriously listen to some high quality music in a quiet room with audiophile headphones, you should be using these.

These are your ultimate every day use headphones. If you're a normal consumer who doesn't care about audiophile grade stuff, these will absolutely blow your mind.

First time I‚Äôm trying to understand the Hi-Res headphones, definitely there is a noticeable difference when I listened first time with this Sennheiser HD660S2. But this needs an Amplifier/DAC, without amp/dac it‚Äôs not good, not portable like any other wireless headphones. I‚Äôm happy I bought this headphones, it‚Äôs amazing to listen some of the Hi-Res tracks.; Lamentablemente, hoy d√≠a resulta dif√≠cil encontrar auriculares tradicionales, sin pilas ni bater√≠a, para conectar por cable a un amplificador. Preguntando por unos as√≠ en unos grandes almacenes, los dependientes me pusieron una cara que parec√≠a que acababa uno de llegar de Marte. No ten√≠an, claro. Historia repetida en otras tiendas del centro de Madrid. ¬°Incre√≠ble pero cierto! As√≠ que recurr√≠ a Amazon, y me mandaron √©stos desde una tienda en Bilbao. Algo caros, pero el sonido es maravilloso. Los graves son potentes, muy potentes, pero al ser abiertos hacia fuera no causan presi√≥n grave en los o√≠dos. Tampoco restan brillo a todas las dem√°s gamas de sonidos. Excelente definici√≥n, claridad, transparencia, agudos brillantes pero sin resultar estridentes. Son justo lo que quer√≠a para escucha tranquila de m√∫sica cl√°sica. No los he probado a√∫n con chunda-chunda moderno, as√≠ que no puedo opinar a este respecto. Grandes, no demasiado pesados para su volumen, muy c√≥modos de llevar puestos largo rato, incluso con gafas. Totalmente recomendados para audi√≥filos que busquen una escucha clara, definida y tranquila. El √∫nico ""pero"" es que el cable es demasiado corto, pero se soluciona con un alargador. ¬øSeguir√° siendo posible encontrar auriculares de esta calidad en el futuro? Digan lo que digan, la conexi√≥n por cable a un amplificador da un sonido mucho m√°s claro y potente que el d√©bil bluetooth a un m√≥vil (puag), que, como mucho, se intenta compensar con unos graves bomb√°sticos pero indefinidos que restan calidad al resto de la gama de sonidos. En fin, muy contento con estos auriculares de alta gama a un precio relativamente razonable para la calidad de sonido que ofrecen.; Beim Abholen dachte ich schon, das Paket sei leer........ Er ist ultraleicht - und doch solide, stabil und robust. Er ist sehr handlich, l√§sst sich gut anfassen, auf- und absetzen, ohne dass man das Gef√ºhl hat, er rutscht einem aus der Hand. Sitzt sehr angenehm - hoher Tragekomfort. Der Klang ist au√üergew√∂hnlich gut! Alles sauber, brilliant, deutlich, differenziert, kraftvoll - ohne aber zu erschlagen. W√ºrde ich jederzeit wieder kaufen.; Dispositivo solido, leggero ed estremamente comodo.
Riproduzione caratterizzata da perfetto controllo dei medi e degli alti con bassi adeguati e articolati che non invadono in maniera esagerata la scena sonora che pur essendo intima convince l'utente a non abbandonare l'ascolto anche dopo molte ore.
_______________

¬ª COSTRUZIONE

Materiali plastici di ottima fattura costituiscono il corpo principale di archetto e altoparlanti.
I padiglioni morbidi e vellutati risultano molto comodi e solidamente applicati.
Un inserto in schiuma sapientemente modellato applicato alla sommit√† dell'archetto, consente di mantenere molto alto il livello di comfort anche dopo lunghe sessioni di ascolto.

Buona la regolazione dell'archetto che si adatta perfettamente a qualunque conformazione fisica. Durante le prime ore di ascolto, la forza di serraggio pu√≤ risultare elevata, ma in breve tempo le cuffie sembreranno modellarsi alla propria conformazione fisica, non dando alcun tipo di fastidio neppure in presenza di occhiali.

I cavi in dotazione sono discreti, interessante il fatto che venga fornito un cavo bilanciato da 4,4 mm cosa assolutamente non scontata.

¬ª PRESTAZIONI

Si tratta di cuffie estremamente poco efficienti ad alta impedenza, di conseguenza non possono essere utilizzate in maniera soddisfacente con un semplice smartphone o collegate direttamente alla scheda audio interna di un PC.

E' necessario dare loro piena energia, attraverso un amplificatore in grado di erogare la potenza necessaria a pilotare i driver in ogni circostanza, ad esempio: HifiMan EF400 oppure Topping A90-D.

Frequenze alte ben riprodotte e dettagliate mai sibilanti, eccessivamente penetranti o fastidiose.
Frequenze basse riprodotte con precisione, presenti e mai ""ruffiane"", non cercano di sorprendere rischiando di impastare il risultato, rendendo il brano troppo scuro e fangoso.
Poco presenti le sub-basse, manca la sensazione fisica della vibrazione che riescono a dare altre cuffie come le HifiMan Ananda Stealth o le HifiMan XS.

La scena sonora √® molto dettagliata, permette all'ascoltatore di determinare con precisione la posizione di ogni sorgente sonora, tuttavia si tratta di una scena abbastanza piccola, molto intima. Non necessariamente si tratta di una caratteristica negativa, direi che invece contribuisce ad evitare l'affaticamento da ascolto, tuttavia un soundstage cos√¨ ridimensionato infonde meno la sensazione di grandiosit√†, di maestosit√† quando si ascoltano ad esempio brani orchestrali o colonne sonore che vorrebbero trasmettere sensazioni di epicit√†.

¬ª CONCLUSIONI

Ottimo dispositivo la cui caratteristica pi√π sorprendente per quanto mi riguarda √® il perfetto controllo, qualunque sia il brano riprodotto o la sequenza musicale in atto.

Le HD660S2 saranno in grado di riprodurre le basse e le alte senza distorsioni, fastidi (es. sibilanti) ma soprattutto senza affaticamento da ascolto, la sensazione infatti √® quella di poterle tenere tutto il giorno passando da un brano all'altro senza soluzione di continuit√†.; I read all the reviews and watched all the YouTube videos on the Sennheiser 600 series and nearly all of the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù dismiss the 660s2 and say the 650 or 600 are better, so I took their advice and bought some 650‚Äôs.

They were surely right - what a stunning set of headphones, sound amazing, so comfortable, well built‚Ä¶but I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking the 660s2‚Äôs looked a bit cooler and were developed much more recently, so must be good too. I caved in and bought some and within an hour the 650‚Äôs went on eBay.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the 650‚Äôs are an excellent headphone, but the 660s2‚Äôs beat them in every department imo. Not by much though at all, it‚Äôs very subtle differences. They feel slightly comfier, lighter and yes I think they look nicer. Sound wise, there‚Äôs more bass, slightly wider soundstage and a bit more detail, just a bit more pleasing all round to my ear.

Only downside is they‚Äôre twice the price of the 650 and no way they‚Äôre twice as good, so if you‚Äôre after a bargain go for the 650‚Äôs every day of the week; Confortable et d‚Äôexcellente qualit√© de son."

1. Really long battery life - one charge would last me a week of regular use.
2. Sturdy build - I move around pretty roughly and the never saw the wires tearing anywhere even after 2 years
3. Decent sound - I am not an audiophile. Don't know much about trebble, bass, highs, lows. The sound was good.

Cons:
1. Once the battery percentage is below 20, you can't listen to music as it keeps shouting ""Oops! Battery low"" every five seconds. This was the most irritating part and kept me wondering why it is even there.
2. It picks a lot of noise while calling if you are in a slightly busy space like office, or road. So not meant for calling
3. The rubber grip that helps to hold it in place came out easily as it would rub against my bag. Since then, I couldn't use it properly as the earphones would fall off.; This is product is very impressive with many fuctions like sound quality and it's durability of battery power. Service is also nice to reach to the customer. At this range they value for your money. Also light weighted product to feel comfortable.; Overall bass and treble balance is good, and music is good. Battery life is excellent, Icharge it once every two weeks. What I don't like is that the right side is heavier than the left side for the additional control switch present, which add to weight. Except this, its a very good product.; Just received the product. Yet to use for some time before I can give a detailed review. At the outset, product seems good. But I was very put off by the poor quality of the USB-C Cable. It does not work. Tried calling Amazon to report this, but only got automated messages with a promise to call back in one minute which did not happen! I hope to receive a replacement USB-C Cable of better quality which works well. This is a small accessory but the poor quality is tarnishing the name of a good brand like BoAT. Very sad!; I am posting this review after i am using ut for 1 month, see everything is good sound, battery, noise cancellation.
But the most worst thing is those 2 hook like structure which makes your earbud fix to you ear sp it won't fall but after 30 min u will feel pain in the where it stucks, and after like 1 hrs it gets worse. So main. Problem is those little outbreak on earpiece.
Rest is good in this price I don't see any change in sound after changing the mode. But everything is balanced.
If you are talking about calling experience it is good not best but good.; 1. The Product Was Good,Without Any Damage.
2. The Earphones Battery Was Insane, Nearly 2Weeks Without Charge.
3. The Earphones Has Good Durability,Water Resistance.
4. The Price Was Really Ok,Good.
5. The BeastXp Mode Was Really Nice,Noise Cancellation Was Good,Low Latency Was Ok.; Durability - The only negative point and the biggest issue is the durability. I bought this neckband in Nov 2023 and in 6 months, one of the ears has stopped working. This is the standard issue of all Boat earphones.
Sound quality - Great sound quality. I can easily differentiate between the different layers of music. Audio is also clear. Never had an issue with hearing. Even the microphone is good.
Battery life - Great battery life! I have charged the band only a few times. Even after using 4-5 hours every day, I didn't need to recharge the battery for the whole week.; Nothing spectacular but will get you through the day. Sound quality is average no noise cancellation but that can go by without noticing . Durability is surely a plus one. Light weight . No complains so far."

It also pairs without any problem with android devices, all you need to do is go to the bluetooth menu and pair it, while your headphones are in pairing mode. If you like bass, and lots of it, I would suggest the XB series of Sony, but if you want a balanced hearing experience (maybe a little bass heavy, but not like Sony XB series) you can go for these pair of headphones. Overall, it is a good product. Amazon's service was very good, it delivered the product on time and hassle free.; Listen to dolby atmos music from Apple Music and you feel nirvana!I purchased for this experience only although supplied pods with lightening connector which you get with iphone 11 or 12 are more than sufficient for lossless and atmos !; I think it's best on logo looks pretty cool in it nice design 100% for the design nice one go for it .; When it's connected with wire it's produce excellent sound but when wireless it's sound quality reduce . Not value for the money.; The battery runs out in a couple of hours; They are not bad, but don't expect the sound quality or the ANC to be great. The build quality is a joke. The plastic below both the hinges broke after a while and Apple wouldn't help me. They were discourteous when I chatted with them and finally agreed to fix them I paid like half of what they cost. Wow thanks Apple. I fixed it as well as I could but it looks hideous now lol.

They are comfortable but the cushions won't last even a year. Mine lasted for about 6 months and I had to replace them. They may last longer if you don't use them regularly. The noise cancellation was impressive at first, but it didn't last too. The ANC grew weaker and weaker and quickly became a very ordinary pair of $100 headset.

I still use them after all these years because they still sound decent. Also, if you're on Android, please don't buy Beats (or Airpods). They disconnect a lot and consume more battery on Android. On iOS, they work flawlessly and I would even recommend this had it not for the range of problems I faced over the years.

Oh and keep in mind that these still rely on micro USB for charging. In 2022.; Please don't buy it. Apple has downgraded the quality of beats that they had in the past. They did it just because of their own product and removing beats out of competition.; don't buy this product low build quality hinges will broke in 6 months and apple centre wont repair it even if its in warranty period.; Nach kurzem Ausflug zu Sony WH-1000MX4 stellte ich schnell fest, dass diese nichts, aber wirklich nichts, f√ºr meine Anwendung waren. Sicherlich hatten diese guten bis sehr guten Klang, aber meine f√ºr mich wichtigen Eigenschaften waren katastrophal.

Die Headsets werden bei mir im Wesentlichen vor und im Schlaf oder beim TV genutzt. Sie d√ºrfen also nicht rutschen und m√ºssen angenehm zu tragen sein. Klang und ANC ist wichtig, aber es wird keine Perfektion ben√∂tigt.

Die Beats Studio3 sind klein, sitzen extrem fest, sind dabei aber nicht unangenehm zu tragen. Sie haben einen Top-Klang und Rauschunterdr√ºckung. Zudem erkennt der Apple TV das Headset und man kann per einem einzigen Knopfdruck TV √ºber Headset h√∂ren. Bei Sony WH-1000XM4 funktioniert dies gar nicht und die Sony sind extrem leicht und rutschen st√§ndig runter.

Nach kurzem Versuch mit Sony bin ich wieder bei den Beats Studio3 gelandet und bereue den Ausflug zu Sony: Vertane Zeit und Geld.; Produkten har n√•gra √•r p√• nacken men uppfyller √§nd√• alla kraven tycker jag (2024). Beats e f√∂r dem med musik √• detalj intresse inte f√∂r den som kommer k√∂pa √• anv√§nda 2 g√•nger sen l√•ta den ligga √• samla damm. 5/5; Geluid is super , noice cancelling is goed. Draag continu comfort is groot. Heb deze voor mijn partner gekocht en draag hem al meer dan twee jaar.
Batterij blijft sterk , zeer snel opgeladen en lange speelduur +8u.
Draag hem door weer en wind tijdens hardlopen , is per ongeluk al paar keer helemaal doorgeregend . Maar blijft het onverminderd goed doen. Wat je noemt kwaliteit !! Doet meer dan je van het verwacht .
Aanrader en geld dubbel en dwars waard !; Very comfy headphones the padding is amazing. I've not had to use them for an extended time yet but they feel like they will be fine for that.

The colour looked lovely (I have the grey / gold)

They don't feel too heavy on the head but there's enough weight to remind you that they are on your head.

They even come with a lovely travel case which will be great when I'm on the move and don't want them getting damaged which is a great bonus.

Sound wise very nice my music sounds great on them and has definitely gotten me listening to music more in my free time.

The only con is the app is pretty basic and borderline useless I thought maybe id be able to adjust the sound levels and bass like I can with my earphones from another bran but alas you can basically check the battery level and change the name of your headphones.; Los auriculares Beats Studio3 Wireless con cancelaci√≥n de ruido son una experiencia auditiva que te transporta a un mundo de m√∫sica sin distracciones.

One of the standout features is the impressive clarity they provide, allowing you to hear even the most subtle details in your music. The sound quality is top-notch, making for an immersive listening experience.
The build quality of these earphones is also noteworthy. Unlike many other wired earphones that feel flimsy and prone to damage, these have a sturdy and substantial cord. This gives me confidence that they will hold up well over time, even with regular use.
Overall, I highly recommend these earphones to anyone looking for a high-quality listening experience without breaking the bank. The combination of excellent sound quality, durable construction, and affordable price make them a smart purchase that is definitely worth the investment.; I am a musician by profession who also produces. I bought these for my son. The positives are build quality, sharpness in the mid and high range, but bass is not good enough to balance it out so it gets a little tiring for long listening as sound is not rounded enough. But I can't really complain because at this price point I don't have the right to. Overall... Go for it. It's sturdy and fits ears perfectly. Blocks all external sound.; This is a great product. It's sound quality, call quality and everything is good. I am not sure about the shortcuts but it doesn't matter that much. But many of you may face a problem. After connecting if earphone logo is not showing in your mobile that means your mobile do not support type-c connectivity devices except charging.
There is a simple solution to this. I cannot guarantee wheather this feature is available in all devices but you can check. After connecting, if earphone logo is not showing, then go to settings, search OTG (under networks and connections,p.b:- may vary device to device) and turn on the OTG option. It should solve the problem. If not then buy another product.; Sound quality is okay but not enough bass compared to other branded products. Then, the build of product is not sufficient as it hampers with comfort in the ears due to the rubber extensions (size optimization is required). Stable for long time use and performance is upto the mark.; Quality is good. Cable is sturdy.
Sound quality is good.
Value for money.; This is the best earphone. 110% reccomend. Using it since last 3-4 years. It's top notch. Everything is top notch. Long life. Good quality. Good sound. Good performance.; I'm so glad that I have ordered that earphones I love the quality of earphone; Pros:

1.Extra Bass Driver: The 10mm extra bass driver contributes to a noticeable low-frequency response, providing a satisfying bass experience for bass enthusiasts.
2.HD Sound: The earphones deliver clear and crisp HD sound, making them suitable for various music genres and multimedia content.
3.In-Line Controls: Convenient in-line controls for playback and call management add to the user-friendly design.
4.Comfortable Fit: The ergonomic design ensures a comfortable fit, suitable for extended usage without causing discomfort.
5.Tangle-Free Cable: The tangle-free cable design helps in reducing the hassle of untangling cords, contributing to overall convenience.

Cons:
1.Build Quality: The overall build quality feels average, with some users reporting durability issues over extended use.
2.Microphone Quality: The microphone quality is passable but may not meet the expectations of users who prioritize crystal-clear call audio.
3.Limited Noise Isolation: The earphones offer limited noise isolation, allowing external sounds to interfere with the listening experience, particularly in noisy environments.
4.Bass Dominance: While the extra bass driver is a highlight, it may overpower other frequencies, leading to a less balanced audio profile for those seeking a more neutral sound.
5.Lack of Extra Features: The earphones lack advanced features such as in-line volume control or noise-canceling capabilities, limiting their versatility."

High-quality sound, supreme durability, and maximum comfort. These are the headphones you've been looking for .","I bought pro-30 headphone in October 2019, and I've been using them for over 4.6 years now. They've been great! The price was reasonable compared to other options, the sound quality is amazing with clear and powerful bass, the cushioning is really soft, and the wire quality is excellent. Plus, it came with a two-year warranty upon registration; I ordered these after hours of researching for decent headphones. These just popped as a recommendation by amazon. Read online reviews especially ones on amazon.com. I ve been listening to them for past 3 hours . Here is my initial feedback -
Sound Quality - Sound signature is V shape . Treble can be slightly sharp at times. Bass is good but at times lacks the extension. Instruments are clear with good separation. Overall sound from these are good but not overwhelming or fantastic. I was not blown away .
Comfort - this is where i am really impressed . The soft memory foam ear cups are really comfortable. I have been wearing these for past 3 hours and my ears dont feel anything. I have owned sony mdr xb450 and sennheiserHD 202 , and compared to them , these are way better.
Build Quality - its all plastic and shiny . I would have loved to see matte finish on these. The rexene leather is soft and good quality. But i dont think colors on these will last .

Box contains - 2 cables and Pouch for storage - which is nice addition.
Over all will give these 4/5; I've been using this October 2019 and I am very happy with the purchase I made. Its slightly heavy on the bass but overall feels okay not like those heavy bass headsets. The Mids and Highs are decent.

The Dual Input is something I appreciate having plugged one end into the phone/tablet and other into an instrument /amplifier. Great for Tutorial Apps. The Cushions are brilliant and comfortable for long usage (read 4-5 hours at one go). It does get sweaty but thats a part of wearing it for long hours anyways (I just flip one for few minutes and then other without actually taking it off entirely). The quality of the microphone is also decent where I've used it for Skype calls and no one ever had to complain about not being able to hear me well. Even the multiplayer games on Console or PC works just great with these.

I got this on sale and money spent was absolutely worth it and will recommend it to all who are looking at high quality headsets at affordable price point.

Update: Jun 2020
Been using these headsets since October 2019 and they are still going strong and nice. So much that I am planning to pick up their A70 Fusion or the A3 with Noise Cancellation ones to go along with.

Update: 2021
The headphones came apart. They just broke off and nothing I can do can set it right. Guess the build quality was just that much.; The OneOdio Studio Pro 50 are one of the best value for money headphones out there, with great comfort and sound quality. I bought them for Rs. 3799, and the closest competitor to these (for me) were the Sony XB550. But then you realise that these have far superior ear cushions and padding on the headband. Thus nothing beats them in comfort. They are over the year style, so your entire ear is covered by the cushions and provides for some decent sound stage. These are passive noise cancelling headphones, so they do a pretty good job at blocking most of the ambient noise. However in too noisy environments some outside noise can seep into them, though not much.
Next is build quality. Most of this headphone is made from plastic, but it is sturdy and I don't see it bending or breaking easily. The ear cups are made from memory protein leather. The headband extenders on both sides are metal. Overall, great build quality for this price.
Sound quality is something interesting here. Out of the box these are definitely a bit more inclined towards bass rather than flat, and to get some of the higher frequencies running you have to tune these a bit. But as soon as you do that, the mids and highs begin to pop up and you truly feel the sound out of these. The bass is great and the vocals are really pronounced and clear. The 50mm drivers do some great work here! Make sure to use some high quality audio to test these out!!
Overall, there is no better product here at this price and definitely ticks all the right boxes for everything to look out for in a headphone. I am extremely glad I bought these and can recommend them any day!; These pair of headphones are a bang for your buck.

I use them mainly for making and listening to music.

Sound quality- I have used many expensive headphones, like the Audio Technica m40s and Beyerdynamic DT 900, I must say the one odio ones blew my mind. I wouldn't say the headphones sound completely flat and neutral but they have a slight color In the mids and highs.

Build quality - The headphones have a solid frame and are quite flexible, for the price these headphones have a great build.

Comfort - The comfort level of these headphones is unmatched, a must-buy for users who plan to use them extensively, you won't even feel them on your head, thanks to the thick padding on the headband and soft huge earpads. These headphones sit over the ear so there is no discomfort at all. Even during the summers, I faced no sweating issues with them.

Sound isolation - It doesn't have any active noise cancellation, but they do a decent job at dimming background noise passively.

Maintenance - After using them for three years, for 4 hours a day, I must say these headphones have held up quite exceptionally, the coating has worn off quite a bit from the headband and cushions, the headband has also started to squeak a bit.

Overall I am quite satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend you buy it; Produto excelente pela faixa de pre√ßo, faixa de frequ√™ncia muito boa confort√°vel pode ser usado para monitorar e tb confer√™ncias e celulares recomendo; This review is for the brown/silver Oneaudio Pro 30 headphones. For the price you are not going to beat the sound quality. I have been difficult to please in audio products for years. Last few years as audiophile products prices has dropped I have been able to afford good quality audio equipment. My main headphones I now use are Sennheiser HD 6xx, Modded Monolith M650, various Sony bluetooth headphones. IEMS: Kzn AS10, Tin Audio T2 Po, Various Klipsh, Shure.

First thing the sound. Listening was done with lossless and MQA files. For the price these are very well balance with enough detail to get an idea what audiophiles look for in quality sound. Highs have decent detail. Not what a sub $50 over the ear headphone normally produces. mids are nice. Again, well balanced with decent detail. Well placed at just under forward sounding. Bass is strong without being boomy. Decent detail. high bass is acceptable and does not muddy the lower mids ACCEPT in music with more complicated lower mid accompanied with lots of bass . Over long listening sessions I felt the need to turn it down a bit but I did not feel it unpleasant. It's hard to peg down the sound style. It's not a V shaped sound as the highs are not pronounced and the bass while not overdone is a bit higher then most flat clinical headphones. These general sound better then 95% of the headphones at this price range. Sound-stage is good for a closed back headphone, especially for the price range. Instrument separation is good. General clarity is good. I have a hard time saying these would be good for STUDIO mixing as the emphasis on bass is a bit high for mixing since you would want as flat as response as possible. These are fun to relax and listen to. Again this is all better then what you would expect at this price range. Even in today's tough market. After sitting for hours with them I feel they are so close audiophile sound it's unbelievable at this price.

Comfort. Very comfortable and light. The pads are deep and soft. Again almost unheard of at this price range. Good clamping force. Soft headband. Only thing I noticed is slightly warm around the ears over an hour or two but nothing uncomfortable.

Build. Here is where it gets tricky. First off its not bad for the price. I would love to see them with less plastic. They have opted for low cost bulky plastic components. I believe they are bulky to give them extra strength. This isn't unusual in the lower cost market but I have seen better designs from competitors but with lower quality sound. The drivers are where it shines with a 90 mm higher quality driver. A good choice. Excellent comfort. You can tell they spent time to get the whole package right. No loose, weak or creaky parts or joints! If they had made these with more metal components I would have been shocked.

Design: Casual with enough small detail. Definitely not fashion cans like Beats but I feel they are on the edge of ""bulky"". I understandable this is to give the plastic extra strength.

Overall they did an excellent job deciding where to go with cutting costs and still making a good product. Although they don't go into great detail and emphasis on the warranty but it is better then average with a full year. I have heard it mentioned elsewhere that it's two years but can't confirm it.

I hope this is just the beginning for them. I can seem them building on this start to get their name out there and I will definitely be keeping an eye on this company. Hopefully we will see them making headphones with better materials but keeping the same attention to balancing the sound with comfort.; Got it for listening music and watching videos. Turn out to be only good for club music and that's that.; Super comfortable, great sound, solid bass. These are my second pair from this company, the first pair lasted almost 2 yrs (I wear headphones for about 10hrs a day). For the price I have no complaints at all.; These earphones sound very good for the price and are comfortable on the head and ears. There‚Äôs no real need for noise cancellation given the plush ear surrounds. I tested them with some UHD music and the highs are clear, mids are good, and the bass needed some EQ adjustment down. Definitely not a flat frequency response but easily fixed according to preference. Very good for tv dialogue. The cords that came with these phones are of commendable quality.

I have some KZ ZAS earbuds for music (which I absolutely love), but these are half the price and being used mostly for late night tv. I‚Äôd say these are a little less responsive and dynamic than the KZs but that‚Äôs the purpose here. Good buy."

Liked the place where buttons configured on the left cup and looks premium. Grey and golden makes it classy. Audio jack included and connects well. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. The headset was precharged upto 90%. This is my first day use, will write detailed review after a month; This is one of the best headphone I have used till date. The bass is too good and it's sound quality is amazing, and workout can be also done with ease while wearing them. But it's build quality, is not that good.
One of my relatives was just casually checking it and suddenly it developed a crack and then the next day it broke. So if you are a rough user of headphones, I prefer to go with something else. Otherwise, they are one of the best in segment and affordable. ( I personally request hammer to introduce new headphones in their lineup as fast as they can).; Background audio overlaps any song or scene. Battery life is super low compared to any other product in price range. Aesthetic is so bad coz its bulky and simply so ugly. Practicality is non existent. If you wear this and specs simultaneously, it hurts above the ears.
I personally will never buy anything from HAMMER ever again . Anybody reading this , don't ever preffer this brand and go for anything that provides valur for money. If i could give Negative Stars i would give you.
Such a waste of money, i would much rather burn it than but this ever again.; Value to money. Battery duration is good. Noise blocking. Heavy bass.; Probably I am the 1st one to review the Bash Max.. the latest varient which are just launched by HAMMER.
The unboxing experience was one of a kind..!! One of the best experience.

The headphones are good for long hour listening as i just completed a 6hr session. And i haven't charged the headphones yet.. not even a single time..!
Headphones seems stylish and sturdy with nice tech...!
I don't think it cancel the noise that much.. and also doesn't have a good mic function.

Headphones are premium looking and feel..
For ‚Çπ2000 they are worth it... I haven't connected the charger yet for checking the charging speed and battery backup..
I am using it for watching Lectures.. they are very comfortable and sound i tried @100 percentage but its very loud.. so 60-70 is the best rang..
I haven't tried the type c to type c connector for wired function will update the same

Check me on Instagram @yash.hemani; Product is very good .cushions are very soft .sound is also good; Pros : nice build quality, it can be foldeable form two sides , powerfull bass , battery backup as said
Cons : sound will leak in full volume when some one is too close to you , low Bluetooth range; I like this headphones about looks, but i dislike about this headphones that it's volume is very high sometimes and sometimes it's very low and i thought that when it's charging is above 40 to 50 it's charge gone very fast and last thing this headphones mic is not that much good quality so kindly check about those things.
Thank you very much,

I bought the Mint green which looks classy.
What I love about it:
- Nice finish
- Soft ear cushions and fit well around the ears
- gives an immersive listening experience
- Easy access buttons for volume, On/Off and ANC
- Sound quality is quite good for me
- Thoughtful of the brand to give extra pins for Piano jack and Airplane input too.

Slightly less points for:
- It's a little tight and not comfortable wearing for long time, at least for me as i have small ears, so it starts pressing on the jaw bone

Note: If the Mic doesn't work for call apps on a computer, go to Sound settings and make sure you have Srhythm selected under Output devices. My Pc had Realtek selected by default, changing it worked fine.; sound quality is great and comfortable to wear these headphones. battery back is good as well.; The ANC works too well , but again not to exaggerate anything, expect not complete noice block out experience within this price range . Its the best in the game in this price range .
Again, worth the investment.; I found this headphone which looks and to some extent has features of high-end headphone but at somewhat low cost. I got Rs 3000 discount on the sale price of Rs 8500 which is one of the reasons I bought it apart from some positive reviews of the product I saw before buying it.

The positive points about the headphone are:
- Over the ear headphone which actually covers your ears and does not sit on your ear
- Bluetooth setup and connection is easy and has good reception
- mic is good and sound quality during calls is clear but due to bluetooth range sometimes the voice breaks once you move a bit away from your phone/computer
- ANC seems to be working well
- charge capacity is good
- quite light-weight and easy control keys on the right side of the headphone to accept and reject calls/change track and change sound volume

Now there are few points which could have been better for a headphone at this price-range:
- The most frustrating point with this headphone is that its loudness capacity is quite low for a headphone like this and maximum volume does not really seems max (I always have to keep the headphone volume to max). For other good headphones used I found the loudness (max volume) is much much higher. So if you are into heavy metals and rock you may not find this headphone very useful.
- The bass quality is not too great
- Though it is actually an over the ear headphone, but I found it is a bit uncomfortable (atleast in hot and humid weather) when both the ears are covered for long time. That maybe also because I am used to inside the ear headphone mostly.
Overall I feel it is okay to buy this headphone if you want to mostly attend calls and hear light music.; for the BIG size it is showing in the ear, it does not cover medium size ears, causing sweat and pain much earlier, as early as 40 mins of usage.; Great product üëå; Amei muito, j√° estou usando faz 1 m√™s todos os dias quase por 2h e ainda n√£o recarrguei. A qualidade do som √© muito boa e isola bem o som de fora. Vale a pena cada centavo, al√©m de lindoo; I never spend a lot on headphones because I'm frugal but my old Bluetooth headphones finally kicked the bucket so I upgraded to these. These are some of the nicest headphones I've ever used, I've never had noise canceling headphones before so I find them quite amazing. So here are the things I like and dislike - overall I love them but there's some smaller problems that I hadn't expected.

Pro's:
-The noise cancelling feature is new and amazing to me, music sounds so much better than I've ever heard it before. I don't think I could go back to headphones without noise cancellation.
-It looks great - I got the colour mint green which I think looks very sleek and like an off-grey colour. Overall I like the design and feel like it's what I expected from the pictures.
-They're extremely comfortable, I have a smaller head so I don't need to adjust the size at all but it is possible. They're so comfy that I wanted to wear them to bed so I could listen to music while I fell asleep. The only reason I didn't is because I realized the noise cancellation would probably make me miss my alarm in the morning.
-They come with a carrying case that makes it easy to bring them anywhere with the charging cable/audio jack cable

Con's:
-The fabric of the carrying case is an unpleasant texture which is a shame since the case is so convenient. I hate touching it, I wish it were smooth or similar to the plastic-fabric muffs/band of the headphones
-I don't like how the muffs lay when I put the headphones around my neck which I do often/when someone tries to speak with me. It's not designed for that situation. The earmuffs also turn outwards, towards who I'm talking to, which would act like a speaker rather than lay flat against my chest where sound would be muffled. Not a huge problem but it's the only pair of over ear headphones I've had that face outwards rather than in.
-There's 4 buttons, the regular backward, pause/play, and forward and then a fourth button that I don't understand. If I hold it eliminates what sounds like static? And if I hold it again the static comes back - the instructions weren't clear on what that was or how to use it. (update: this is the noise cancelling feature)

UPDATE: Overall, if you're not an audio snob these are very nice and comparable to Beats for a fraction of the price. I've had them for roughly 2 months and the only criticism I have is that they're not great for calls - I often have videocalls via my computer and I've been told these emit a small echo-like sound which wasn't brought up to me until well after I reviewed these. If microphone quality is a concern I'd consider a different brand, personally I've had too many problems with headphone mics and I'm looking into good desk microphones to work alongside these headphones.

2+YEARS UPDATE: Long story short, they still work great - also changed 4 stars to 5. I bought these headphones in Dec 2021 and was shocked to learn they blew up as a ""you've got to get these"" item in 2023. Imagine my surprise when people were complimenting me on my 'on trend' headphones, I even came across a video recommending the headphones I'd had for over a year! But most surprising of all was returning to this product page today and realizing how many people had found my review helpful, I'm genuinely so grateful for that. I know it's silly to be sentimental about but I put a lot of time into my reviews. When you don't have a lot of money you do a lot of research before you buy anything, I rely on the testimonies of others so I try to make my reviews as useful as possible for people in the same boat. And for that reason I'd like to say - these headphones are a truly good investment if you're looking for bang for your buck and one of the best purchases I've ever made. These quickly became my work headphones because of their noise cancelling abilities around machinery, I now use them for hours everyday on the job. In a regular 40 hour work week I only need to charge them once a week, recently I've bumped that up to twice but that's more to stop myself from worrying about them dying unexpectedly (not because it's needed). They work just as well as the day they arrived, the appearance is deteriorating due to constant use though. Despite cleaning them frequently they look dingy and the plastic on the earpads has started to tear and peel as of the last 2 weeks. I came to this page to look at what other options this company sells and possibly re-buy these ones to eventually replace my first pair, I don't think they need to be outright replaced yet though, just the ear pads. I am slightly frustrated as the ear pads are replaceable (you can do this yourself easily and it's advertised as a feature in the listing) but I can't find earpads to replace them with. All the options to do so are from 3rd party companies and only come in black which wouldn't look good with my mint headphones. Still, I don't want to replace perfectly good headphones.; Despu√©s de unas semanas de uso (en los que no he vuelto a cargar la bater√≠a, despu√©s de la primera carga antes de usarlos) estoy muy satisfecho con estos auriculares.
C√≥modos, buena calidad de sonido, bater√≠a muy duradera. Compra maestra!

As convenient and helpful wireless earphones are (I own a pair of AirPods Pro) ill always use a wired headphone for the following reasons
: better sound quality due to less transmission loss
: better mic quality
: safety (wireless earphones are more prone to being hacked )

Now to talk in more detail about the EarPods
They offer great vocals and the sound is really well balanced , these aren‚Äôt very bass heavy but they still have a very decent punch. I love the fact that it gets a tiny remote with the mic and physical buttons to control the music .
Yes it doesn‚Äôt have Spatial Audio or noise cancellation , but if you‚Äôve ever used an AirPods Pro I think you‚Äôll only really miss the noise cancellation .
The wires do seem a bit fragile as they aren‚Äôt braided but for the price I don‚Äôt really have much to complain .; it‚Äôs great, no compromise in music quality but the wire feels like it would break anytime.; It‚Äôs fake not working properly; So I have been using apple earphone for a year now and let me tell you it is worth it. The sound quality and wire quality is amazing. At first i was skeptical about the wire quality as it is very thin and I thought it will break easily but trust me it is durable and plus it is very easy to untangle the leads due to the quality of wire. I have no complaint from this. The sound quality is amazing and you can even hear the sound in crowded place as well unlike other airdopes or earphones which have limited sound quality. Just go for it. It is one time investment. I have tried other brands as well like boat and have purchased 2-3 airdopes in a year because one or another ear piece stopped working. So instead of investing 1000 rupees on another low quality brand, invest one time on this if you dont have budget for airpods. Also it is less hassle to keep these because other eardopes need charging and you have to additionally carry the charger. But this works amazing for me. Go for it; It is a completely original product and its sound quality is amazing and value for money. By wearing these airpods, there is no need to go to the air, it is full of fun.thank you Amazon for giving us great service üòÑ‚ù§Ô∏è; Good Product

With a USB-C charging port for charging convenience and expanded compatibility.","I recently purchased the Anker Soundcore Q10 headphones for 4k and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed with these as they a fantastic blend of excellent sound quality, comfort, and affordability.

Pros :
1.Sound Quality - 5/5
The Q10 headphones provide an impressive audio experience with outstanding sound quality, delivering sharp highs, full-bodied mids, and impactful bass. Whether I'm enjoying my preferred tunes or immersing myself in a movie, they ensure a balanced and engaging sound. Notably, the bass response adds depth and resonance to my music without overpowering the rest of the audio range. Furthermore, the Soundcore app offers numerous Equalizer and tuning options that make a discernible difference in the sound output.
2. Fit and build quality - 4.5/5
Comfort is a top priority for me, and the Q10i doesn't disappoint. As they are Over the ear , the memory foam ear cups provide a full and comfortable fit, allowing for extended listening sessions without any discomfort. The adjustable headband is also rigid. The overall build quality feels great , the cups did seem wobbly after few but doesnt feel like a weak point . The foldable design adds convenience for storage and portability, making them easy to carry in a bag or case , I already got a case which fits the headphones without any issues : https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B08JTMCSM9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

3.Battery and Connectivity - 5/5
The battery life is impressive as well. I've used them for several hours on a single charge, and they still had plenty of juice left. Additionally , this supports 3.5mm jack so we can plug in them if battery runs out
The Bluetooth connection is smooth, and I haven't encountered any problems with pairing or signal interruptions. The controls on the ear cups are user-friendly and straightforward, enabling swift adjustments to volume, playback, and handling calls.

Con:
1. Mic Quality - 3/5
I'm not impressed with the mic quality. The person on the other end did say that the voice is quite low even though I'm speaking loudly . The issue is more persistent with Bluetooth , while I did not get any negative feedback while using aux cable. Also , this doesn't come with a pair of aux cable which is a bummer.

2. Weight - 3.5/5
Even though the headphones are comfortable , at first usage/ first few mins it feels heavy on the head and neck. Just a nit picking con.

3. Not a big con but there is a lack of active noise cancellation, but considering the price point, it's not a deal-breaker. The passive noise isolation is still effective in reducing ambient noise and works flawlessly, so good that once I keep it on at a mid noise environment , I dont hear outside noise .

The Anker Soundcore Q10 headphones are a value for the price. Providing exceptional sound quality, comfort, and long battery life, these headphones stand as an excellent choice for music lovers and anyone in search of a reliable pair of wireless headphones. I recommend them to those looking for a dependable and budget-friendly audio solution.

Overall I'd rate this 4.5/5; Recived today, good product.
Pros:
good quality product in this range
Sound quality is awesome
Perfect for Movie,songs,calls
Multiple connectivity. Laptop and phone at same time
Low latency for calls and movies and good bass.
Cons:
Donot buy if you have a neck pain issue. As this product is very heavy. After 1 hour use my neck started to ache.
Ear cup material is not breathable , so sweating if you are not in AC room.
Connectivity steps are complicated.
BT/ON/OFF/MULTIPLE CONNECTIVITY all are in same button. Please improve this functionality as it is not friendly for use.

Amazon packing was not that good as the package was litle bit broken.; I agree it is an excellent headphone at given price. However, the volume of headphone does make you feel the price vs product comparison.

Pros:
1. Well built and headphone cover the ears perfectly.
2. Headphone cushions are of good quality. Person in the front can also hear the sound.
3. Voice clarity is immaculate.
4. Does not hurt your ears even at high volume.
Cons:
1. Little heavy built compared to other Hps, however output is really good.
2. At 100% volume you can hear excellent base
3. Wearing head phones for long hours in summer is giving sweat.
4. Cloth materials could have been improvised.; I recently purchased the Anker Over The Ear Headphones, and I must say I'm thoroughly impressed with their performance. These headphones have exceeded my expectations in several key areas, making them a fantastic choice for both music enthusiasts and everyday users.

The first thing that struck me was the exceptional sound quality these headphones deliver. Whether I'm listening to my favorite music, watching movies, or even taking phone calls, the audio is crisp, clear, and immersive. The bass is deep without overpowering, and the mids and highs are well-balanced, allowing me to enjoy every note and detail in my music.

Wearing these headphones for extended periods is a breeze, thanks to their plush ear cushions and adjustable headband. They fit comfortably over my ears without causing any discomfort or fatigue. I can wear them for hours without feeling the need to take a break.

Anker really nailed it with the battery life on these headphones. I was pleasantly surprised by how long they last on a single charge. I've used them for several days without needing to recharge, and that's a huge plus for me.

The headphones have a solid construction and feel durable, but I'd have liked a bit more metal in the build for added sturdiness. However, I've been careful with them, and they seem to be holding up well so far.

Pairing these headphones with my devices is a breeze. They connect quickly, and I haven't experienced any signal dropouts or connectivity issues. The Bluetooth range is also impressive.

While the noise isolation is good, it's not the best I've encountered. It effectively blocks out most ambient noise, but some higher-pitched sounds may still seep through. However, it's not a deal-breaker for me, as it's still quite effective.

In summary, these headphones offer an incredible listening experience, comfort, and impressive battery life. They're an excellent value for the price, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Whether you're a music lover or just looking for a reliable pair of headphones for everyday use, these should be at the top of your list. I highly recommend them!

Pros:
- Outstanding sound quality
- Comfortable for long listening sessions
- Impressive battery life
- Easy and reliable connectivity

Cons:
- Slightly better noise isolation could be desirable
- Build quality, while good, could be more robust
- The headphones are a little loose on my head (maybe because of my small skull size :) ); I've been using the Soundcore Q20 headphones for a few weeks now, and I am thoroughly impressed. These headphones deliver exceptional sound quality and noise cancellation, all at a fraction of the cost of more premium brands.
The sound quality is outstanding, with deep bass and clear mids and highs. Whether I'm listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the audio is consistently crisp and immersive.
The active noise cancellation (ANC) feature works remarkably well, effectively drowning out background noise in a variety of settings. It's perfect for commuting, working in noisy environments, or just enjoying some quiet time.
The headphones are lightweight and very comfortable, even during extended use. The ear cups are well-padded and provide a snug fit without being too tight. The overall design is sleek and modern.
Battery life is another standout feature. I can easily get up to 40 hours of playback on a single charge with ANC off, and around 30 hours with ANC on. Charging is quick and convenient with the included USB-C cable.
Considering the price, the Soundcore Q20 offers incredible value. It competes with much more expensive models in terms of performance and features.
If you're looking for high-quality, budget-friendly noise-cancelling headphones, the Soundcore Q20 is an excellent choice. It delivers superb sound, effective noise cancellation, and great comfort, all at an affordable price point. Highly recommended!

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ; Si bien no soy como otras personas un ""reviewer profesional"" o que me dedique a esto, puedo dar los suguientes puntos en base a mi experiencia personal tantoc o melomano como musico por hobbie.
En mi uso de audifonos tengo algunos en gama y costos similares, como son los JBL LIVE 500, Audio-technica ar3bt, Urbanista Seattle....
Estos Anker mi primera impresion fue, que tenian bastante bajos que ensuciaban el resto de la pista, a diferencia de los otros 3 modelos que mencione eh utilizado... si bien no me desagradaba, estaba considerando la calidad de audio que ofrecen los puse en ultimo lugar de mi lista de gadgets...
PERO O SORPRESA....cuando active el Anc (cancelacion de ruida activa) wwoow.... si bien por si sola la cancelacion pasiva hace muy buen trabajo, esta funcion mejora levemente la eliminacion de ruido ambiental, PERO, tambien cambian las frecuencias la musica que estas escuchando dandele una sensasion de amplitud y claridad a la musica que no tenian en mis anteriores audifonos. Los bajos pasaron a estar en segundo plano, OJO no desaparecen simplemente todo esta en un mejor balance, pero con esto todos los intrumentos escuchando rock, suenan claros estan presentes, mejoro bastante la calidad del sonido y precencia en escenario. En musica electronica tambien tienen una sobresaliente actuacion por sus bajos y potenciador de bajos electronicos que activas con un boton en los audifonos.
CONCLUSION, recomendados!!!! definitivamente Anker es una marca que lo viene hacieno bien ultimamente.
MATERIALES, CONSTRUCCION Y PRESENTACION, si bien la caja y los empacas no son de lo mas eleborado y lujoso, hasta parecieran algo de baja calidad, los audifonos los partes plasticas se ven de muy buena calidad, definitivo parece que soportaran el uso diario y algo de trato rudo pueden soportar si los cargas en tu mochila con mas cosas. Las almohadillas cubren bien tu oreja y te aislan del ruido exterior, son comodas, un poco calientes al ser piel sintetica, pero tolerables.; Tecnicamente, √© um excelente produto com graves bem equilibrados e som bem cristalino. Mas comprei o fone para tentar eliminar o barulho de uma obra vizinha. O Noise Cancelling dele √© muito bom, apesar do quase impercept√≠vel white noise. Deixa um pouco de ru√≠do se usar muito baixo, mas resolveu o problema de barulho externo. Almofadas confort√°veis que cobrem toda a orelha e isso ajuda mais ainda. O acabamento √© bom, nada excepcional, mas cumpre a fun√ß√£o. Comandos externos de f√°cil acesso e a bateria duuuuura longas 40 horas (sem NC). Valeu cada centavo!; These headphone have a great sound frequency range and are very comfortable to wear. The battery lasts a long time between charges even with heavy use. The option of having them wired or Bluetooth is another great thing with these headphone. I also have the Q30s and both are well made. The company is great to deal with if you ever have an issue and go above and beyond to help sort things out l.; Bought these for a friend's birthday and gotta say we were all impressed. It's not the best pair of headphones in the world, but will definitely be fine for normal users looking for NC that benefits the experience. If you want to get in to NC headphones but not break the bank I would definitely recommend these."

On the one hand, they excel in terms of features and audio quality, but on the other, their long-term durability is a significant concern when it comes to the wired version.

First, let's discuss the positive aspects. The Samsung earphones come packed with features that enhance the listening experience. The sound quality is impressive, delivering crisp and clear audio across a wide range of frequencies. They also offer great noise isolation, which is perfect for shutting out the outside world and immersing yourself in your music or podcasts.

The earphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods, and they fit securely in your ears, which is a big plus for active individuals or commuters. The in-line microphone and remote control make it easy to manage calls and playback without reaching for your phone, adding convenience to your daily routine.

However, the Achilles' heel of these earphones is their durability, especially when it comes to the wired version. Over time, I found that the wires tend to fray and weaken, leading to audio issues and sometimes complete loss of functionality. It's disappointing to see such a great product compromised by the relatively short lifespan of the wires.

If you're considering purchasing these Samsung earphones, I'd strongly recommend the wireless version for better durability. While they come at a higher price point, they eliminate the wire-related durability concerns and provide a more extended period of reliable usage.

In conclusion, the Samsung earphones offer excellent audio quality and a range of features that enhance the listening experience. However, if you opt for the wired version, be prepared for potential durability issues with the wires over time. For a more lasting and hassle-free experience, the wireless option may be the way to go.; ordered Samsung Original EHS64 Wired in Ear Earphones with Mic & good for daily use.
good clarity for long calls & music. ear buds fit well in ears unlike TWS ear buds which are very uncomfortable. samsung wired earphones are very reliable and much better than many other brands.
however, it does not have any noise cancellation. mic quality for calls is loud and clear.; The sound quality is very nice . Overall good.; This is not same Ehs64 model. Old Ehs64 version was far better than this new version headphone. Quality is different, bass is low, vocals are not crisp than old ehs64. Old ehs64 origin was china. This new is made in Vietnam totally not best. Good for normal user. Old was good in every segment like low, mids and high. Since 2013 still working fine without any problems, no one can beat this headphone in terms of sound quality, but this new version is not my taste. Not bad but not best.; Worthy product, travel friendly. Looks good and quality was super; Samsung one of the best earphone nice sound quality, comfort, fit,appearance, stability,portability; I Received A Damaged Product First. Then I Replace It. Now I Have A Fine Piece. Its Good But Its Average Life Is 6 Months Only."

- Call quality is excellent plus it cuts off ambient noise while you are talking which is great. So if you are into taking lot of calls then this is the perfect choice as it keeps you focused as well ensures the quality of your voice renders perfectly to the listener on the other side.
- Looks modern and sleek.
- ANC is really good with choice of setting the level unlike QC35ii where there is zero, mid, high with NC700 you can choose individual range for what is low what is mid and high.
- Ear pads are really of great quality and fit perfectly
- Sound quality is balanced renders natural sounds without adding too much of effect but if you like thump then may not be the best one out there.
- Touch controls are really good esp to pause by just double tapping is really neat
- Putting it in the case is pretty easy unlike the foldable qc35ii. I've read reviews where people preferred foldable ones but in my personal preference keeping it in the box is pretty easy compared to qc35ii where you had to figure out which side to fold and then take care while putting it in the box that you have used the padding perfectly.

Cons
- The metal band makes it a little heavy compared to qc35ii and you can feel it during the initial use but will get used to it.
- Butons are very flimsy and don't give the feel as qc35ii controls, they have tried to make them small and sleek but in doing so have made them really to thin and looks to be of cheap quality
- Not much difference in sound quality compared to qc35ii so not a big upgrade if you are planning for.
- Pairing with the app to start using it.; Build quality is very good. Sound is just super, I personally like balnced bass and optimized for all sorts of sounds. It serves that purpose. Yeah, price little high but over all product is good. One thing is, AUX cable they designed like, headphone side 2.5 mm and other side 3.5 mm jack. May be they wanted to use only their accessories :); Immaculate sound quality, great build, fabulous ANC - an all-round winner!; Astounding noise cancellation, beautiful design and poor quality software support.

1. The noise cancellation is unrivalled. A truly worthy competitor in this field. Compare it with the world‚Äôs topmost racing cars in the field of noise cancellation.

2. It looks and feels like a piece of modern art. If you have an eye for sleek design, minimalism and ‚Äúless is more‚Äù thought process, you would appreciate these. Pitch it against any other headphone in the market side by side, and you could see the difference in build quality and design superiority.

3. Software. Bose should fire at least half of its software engineering people. Looks like Bose doesn‚Äôt quiet really know what Quality Software means in 2021. Buggy iOS app, pathetic support site etc. it looks like Bose spent a ton of money in hiring top notch UI/UX designers and cut corners by hiring stupid and cheap app developers. The can‚Äôt be said to be reliable at all. It looks like force fit component in an otherwise beautiful and rock solid product which is worthy of being put at MOMA (Museum of Modern Art). I am guessing Bose relies heavily on third party software developers who don‚Äôt have any idea of what a ‚ÄúBose‚Äù product really means and who the ‚ÄúBose‚Äù people are. In all, software is a huge let down.

4. Innovation and features. The world has made major technological advancements extremely fast and Bose seems still locked in its own research labs and in their ivory towers. Why Bose? Why the attitude? Why are you not adopting the best codecs available out there? Who says you have to clutter your product? Look at Sony and Apple and learn from their best success. Don‚Äôt think that you can remain hidden in your own research labs and can do all the innovation yourself. Because, a day might come, you will be paying a heavy price for this. If you don‚Äôt innovate and compete, you will die.

Summary:
This product would have been an undisputed leader 3 years ago, but not right now. Sorry Bose, others like Sony and Apple have worked very very hard and they deserve the respect and the market a bit more than you for this product.; Awesome noise cancelling headphones ever; It's just been 1 day since I received them and I can't get over how sturdy, compact and beautful these are. Having worn it for more than an hour, I felt no discomfort at all. Its multi-device connection also works well - it's connected simultaneously to my laptop and mobile.; Son unos aud√≠fonos incre√≠bles con una gran cancelaci√≥n de ruido , tambi√©n cubren bien los o√≠dos y son c√≥modos , las personas de cabeza grande no tienen nada que tener , yo los compr√© por qu√© quer√≠a unos que cubrieran el o√≠do completo , fueran c√≥modos y de gran calidad de materiales y estos lo son; Love everything about the headphone/headset.

The bluetooth connectivity is breeze and the sleep/wake up mode is really fast and accurate as it detects the headset being worn.

The only con i have is the battery life lasts for a day and required to be charged. But it is not a deal breaker.

I use this more for Microsoft Teams call or phone call, the audio is crystal clear and the mic is pretty good.

The NC is definitely very good for the cost of the headphones.; These are not perfect as headphones go, but they are literally the nicest noise cancelling headphones that any amount of money can buy. They have their ups and downs. I'm going to talk in depth about each of these, but overall these are the best noise cancelling headphones money can buy, so even when it comes to their downsides, you can't do better.

First, if you're a regular consumer, you'll be blown away by the sound quality. However, if you're an audiophile used to audiophile grade open back headphones like the Sennheiser HD800, these fall short of audiophile levels of sound quality. Let me explain why that is.

Sound quality wise, the sound quality is overall spectacular, but it has two problems. Bass is way overemphasized, and the treble is rolled off. The treble issue is in my opinion the only really major flaw you have to deal with in these headphones. It's really a shame. Even with EQ, there's no good way to make up for the treble problem because the high end is just always a little lacking.

Bass is massively overemphasized, but everyone seems to do that these days, and most people seem to love it. Thankfully, you can just lower the bass in the EQ and it works fine, but from an audiophile perspective it's still a mark against it. You can also raise the bass if you want to lose your hearing and cause brain damage from the thump. These things will thump so hard that it'll give you a concussion.

Aside from those two downsides, instruments sound absolutely spectacular with amazing definition, separation, and clarity, it's just really unfortunate that they rolled off the treble. It'd be nice if the bass wasn't so overemphasized, but the bass at least is understandable since it seems to be what most people want. I will say however that the mid is absolutely spectacular, so there's that.

Even at their best, if you're a real audiophile, these don't hold up to the sound quality of high end audiophile open back headphones by Sennheiser like the HD650 or HD800. These are consumer grade, very top end consumer grade, but they don't reach the heights of real audiophile territory. For most people though, these will blow you away.

Noise cancelling wise, these are the best money can buy. I've tried other noise cancelling headphones, and these destroy everything that I've ever tried. It's a night and day difference in terms of the overall quality and effectiveness of the noise cancelling compared to other noise cancelling headphones.

However, they're not totally perfect. I have a bunch of air filter fans running full blast all the time, and it reduces their volume by 90+%, but it's a little inconsistent. Some of the inconsistency comes from just how the headphones sit in my head, if I get them just right, it mutes probably 98% of the sound, but if they're just a little off, it drops to between 90-95%. Sometimes it just seems to work better than other times with no apparent explanation. 90% is still a ton of noise reduction. Be aware though that you can still hear things, they're just quiet. Like if you pass a fan while walking, you can still hear it, it's just quiet.

There is sometimes a slight amount of pressure from the noise cancellation, but it's very minimal, and a lot of the time there's actually none.

Next, we get into the real premium stuff. You're paying like $400 for this, so let's talk about what you're really paying for: the creature comforts and luxury that get overlooked at lower price ranges...

For example, the case for these headphones is simply amazing. It feels extremely premium, it has a nice touch, it's light but durable, it has this lovely leathery material that is a joy to hold. It just feels like a million bucks. Even the zipper is nice! The internal layout is likewise spacious, protective and just overall very high quality.

Same with the headphones themselves. As an object that you hold in your hand, these things simply feel incredible. They're unbelievably light, I don't know how they made it feel this light. The headband literally feels like a cloud, it almost melts in your hand. I've never felt anything like it. It is insanely soft with this beautiful smooth leather feeling, yet it doesn't collapse when you wear it. I don't even understand how that works, but it does.

These are the most comfortable set of headphones I have ever put on my head by far. It feels like you're wearing a cloud. It's crazy. The clamp force is so low that I can wear these for hours and hours on end and they just feel insanely comfortable the entire time.

Even just holding these headphones physically, they feel like a million bucks. Like they've got these buttery smooth moving collapsible cans, yet they feel solid and durable, and they have this lovely smooth feeling to them.

These are the things you're really paying for when you pay $400. It's just all those little details and luxuries that really make it. They put a lot of luxury into the things outside the actual speakers, and it shows. They feel super premium in your hands, they're a beautiful shape, they're insanely comfortable to wear, they have this elegant simple design to them, and their case is outstanding. Seriously, if you hold the case and headphones of any of the other noise cancelling headphones in your hands, they just don't feel as nice as this.

Overall, I really wish they hadn't rolled off the treble. That's its one major flaw. However, these are so good that I can't go back to anything else (other than my open back audiophile sennheisers for serious listening). These are like the ultimate casual headphones for every day use. Watching TV? Use these. Going on an airplane? Use these. Going to the gym? Use these. Going for a walk? Use these. Unless all you want to do is sit down and seriously listen to some high quality music in a quiet room with audiophile headphones, you should be using these.

These are your ultimate every day use headphones. If you're a normal consumer who doesn't care about audiophile grade stuff, these will absolutely blow your mind. Even if you're an audiophile, you'll probably end up addicted to them for every day normal use. I'm kindof addicted to them myself, to be honest.; Exactly what I‚Äôm expecting from lead brands. Everything is top notch about this headphone.; ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤ÿ© ÿ¨ÿØÿß"

From its stylish design to its outstanding audio performance, it has exceeded my expectations in every way.
Design and Build:
The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek and modern design of the Boat Neckband. The combination of black and silver accents gives it a premium look, and it's incredibly lightweight, making it comfortable to wear for extended periods. The flexible neckband design ensures a secure fit around my neck, even during rigorous workouts or when I'm on the move.

Sound Quality:
The sound quality of these neckbands is nothing short of exceptional. The Boat Neckband delivers rich, clear, and well-balanced audio. The bass is punchy without overpowering the mids and highs, allowing me to enjoy a wide range of music genres with utmost clarity. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tracks or taking calls, the audio quality is consistently impressive.

Battery Life:
One of the standout features of the Boat Neckband is its impressive battery life. I can easily go through several days of moderate use on a single charge. This is incredibly convenient, as I no longer have to worry about constantly recharging them, making them perfect for long trips or days filled with back-to-back meetings.

Connectivity:
Pairing the Boat Neckband with my devices is a breeze. The Bluetooth connectivity is stable and quick, and I've had no issues with dropouts or disconnections. The device also has a decent Bluetooth range, allowing me to move around my home without losing connection quality.

Comfort and Convenience:
These neckbands are designed with comfort in mind. The earbuds fit snugly in my ears, and the neckband doesn't cause any discomfort, even during extended wear. The in-line controls are intuitive, making it easy to adjust the volume, change tracks, or take calls without reaching for my phone.

Call Quality:
The built-in microphone provides crystal-clear call quality. I've had numerous conversations, and the person on the other end has always reported that my voice comes through loud and clear, even in noisy environments.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Boat Neckband has proven to be an excellent investment. It combines style, comfort, and exceptional sound quality into one impressive package. Whether you're a music enthusiast or need a reliable hands-free calling solution, these neckbands deliver on all fronts. I wholeheartedly recommend the Boat Neckband to anyone in search of a top-notch wireless audio experience.; Noise cancellation ok, battery is good, sound quality ok, ok; Not worth for money. Can't hear clear sound and base; The two device pairing and simultaneous use on both the devices is a great feature when you don't want to constantly change devices using button or something. The sound quality is also excellent for the price. There are still two things that bother me. The feature of magnetic bus is kinda a gimmic, it doesn't turn the earbus on or off. But the feature of two device simultaneous pairing make up for it. Sometime when I turn the earphone on it doesn't seem to connect to my phone instantly, I have to manually do it and in other cases it perfectly does that. The other thing is build quality is okay, but can't argue for the price it's good enough. Only if they used rubberised plastic instead of textured one, would've had a better feel to it.; Less battery life; Been using it since a week and they're really comfortable. I got it delivered in two days without delivery charge and it's worth spending ‚Çπ1000 on. It's quality is really good. It has great battery life too since I noticed that it charged up in an hour and works for like 30 minutes with no disturbance.; A very good neckband with good sound quality and connectivity is also good.; This is so good but not well"

Your headset is shipped in power saver mode. The headset is only 10% charged. Failure to do so may cause connectivity issues.,"Pros:
1. Really long battery life - one charge would last me a week of regular use.
2. Sturdy build - I move around pretty roughly and the never saw the wires tearing anywhere even after 2 years
3. Decent sound - I am not an audiophile. Don't know much about trebble, bass, highs, lows. The sound was good.

Cons:
1. Once the battery percentage is below 20, you can't listen to music as it keeps shouting ""Oops! Battery low"" every five seconds. This was the most irritating part and kept me wondering why it is even there.
2. It picks a lot of noise while calling if you are in a slightly busy space like office, or road. So not meant for calling
3. The rubber grip that helps to hold it in place came out easily as it would rub against my bag. Since then, I couldn't use it properly as the earphones would fall off.; This is product is very impressive with many fuctions like sound quality and it's durability of battery power. Service is also nice to reach to the customer. At this range they value for your money. Also light weighted product to feel comfortable.; Overall bass and treble balance is good, and music is good. Battery life is excellent, Icharge it once every two weeks. What I don't like is that the right side is heavier than the left side for the additional control switch present, which add to weight. Except this, its a very good product.; Just received the product. Yet to use for some time before I can give a detailed review. At the outset, product seems good. But I was very put off by the poor quality of the USB-C Cable. It does not work. Tried calling Amazon to report this, but only got automated messages with a promise to call back in one minute which did not happen! I hope to receive a replacement USB-C Cable of better quality which works well. This is a small accessory but the poor quality is tarnishing the name of a good brand like BoAT. Very sad!; I am posting this review after i am using ut for 1 month, see everything is good sound, battery, noise cancellation.
But the most worst thing is those 2 hook like structure which makes your earbud fix to you ear sp it won't fall but after 30 min u will feel pain in the where it stucks, and after like 1 hrs it gets worse. So main. Problem is those little outbreak on earpiece.
Rest is good in this price I don't see any change in sound after changing the mode. But everything is balanced.
If you are talking about calling experience it is good not best but good.; 1. The Product Was Good,Without Any Damage.
2. The Earphones Battery Was Insane, Nearly 2Weeks Without Charge.
3. The Earphones Has Good Durability,Water Resistance.
4. The Price Was Really Ok,Good.
5. The BeastXp Mode Was Really Nice,Noise Cancellation Was Good,Low Latency Was Ok.; Durability - The only negative point and the biggest issue is the durability. I bought this neckband in Nov 2023 and in 6 months, one of the ears has stopped working. This is the standard issue of all Boat earphones.
Sound quality - Great sound quality. I can easily differentiate between the different layers of music. Audio is also clear. Never had an issue with hearing. Even the microphone is good.
Battery life - Great battery life! I have charged the band only a few times. Even after using 4-5 hours every day, I didn't need to recharge the battery for the whole week.; Nothing spectacular but will get you through the day. Sound quality is average no noise cancellation but that can go by without noticing . Durability is surely a plus one. Light weight . No complains so far."

Voice quality is good for kids.. it dosent have bluetooth though it wasnt my requirement. Colour is superb. Its user friendly; Very cheap plastic.looks very good from outside but when you started using it you will understand how delicate it is. We are so much disappointed, as this was bought for my kid. Which eventually disappointed him as well. As he never got a chance to use it.
We demand replacement. As this happened soon after return window is closed. Hope you will value your customers.; Good; Quality of sound and product is v good. Bought it for my son; Everything seems good, the only issue I observed is that frequent adjustment (making it bigger or smaller) of the headphone causes the groves/slots to wear out rather fast and then leading to it not staying firm.; Good product; Bought for my 6 year old nephew who loves blasting his music. Tired of hearing the same song over and over again we bought these for him as a gift and we all loved it. It‚Äôs noise cancelling, comfy and a good buy for the price, definitely recommended.; I recently purchased the iClever HS19 Kids Headphones with Microphone for my 7-year-old's long plane ride, and I must say they were an absolute lifesaver! These headphones turned out to be the perfect travel companion, providing a comfortable and enjoyable experience for my little one.

First and foremost, the design and size are ideal for young children. The headphones fit perfectly over my 7-year-old's ears without feeling too tight or uncomfortable, allowing him to wear them for an extended period without any complaints. The adjustable headband is a thoughtful feature that ensures a secure fit as he grows.

The sound quality was excellent, striking a perfect balance between clear audio and child-safe volume levels. I appreciated the thoughtful consideration put into protecting young ears while still delivering an enjoyable listening experience. The headphones provided crystal-clear sound, making it easy for my child to enjoy his favorite music and watch videos during the long plane ride.

Additionally, the headphones' durability and sturdiness were evident throughout the trip. Despite being used by a playful and energetic 7-year-old, they held up remarkably well, showing no signs of wear and tear.

Another feature I appreciated was the foldable design, making it easy to store the headphones in our carry-on bag without taking up much space. It added to the convenience of travel and ensured that the headphones remained protected during transit.

In conclusion, the iClever HS19 Kids Headphones with Microphone proved to be a fantastic investment for our long plane ride. They provided excellent sound quality, a comfortable fit, and a convenient microphone for communication. With their durable build and child-friendly design, these headphones are sure to be a reliable companion for any young traveler or music enthusiast. I highly recommend them to parents looking for high-quality headphones for their kids!; Mein Sohnemann ist zufrieden und wir auch, der Klang ist auch gut, f√ºr das Geld kann man die echt weiter empfehlen.; Light weight , comfortable to wear , so I've been told by my 8yr old :) she love's the sound quality and the colour combination, They seem too be made sturdy with good quality plastics

With an impressive 60 hours of playback time, they are perfect for users who need reliable headphones for long listening sessions. While they lack active noise cancellation, the overall performance and features make them a solid choice in their price range. The green color adds a unique touch, though it may not be to everyone's taste. Overall, the Duke headphones are a great option for those seeking affordable, high-quality wireless headphones.; The best thing about this headphone is it give over the ear feature in 1299/- and its really confortable and also the bass is unexpectedly GOOD. And for audio volume level, It gives hearable sound in just 18% of computer audio and when i increase audio upto 100 i can hear even the base from 40cm far from the headphones.
As for comfort The cushions are really good, i was able to keep it on ears for 3hrs but not more than that cause it mae my head feel dizzy cause of hearing all my favourate melodies, old school, hip hop, rap and metal songs all at once LOL, But like other headphones i bought this one is stiff and feels like it will break if pressurised to stretch .
As for looks I love the RGB and the grill metal look it gives is DOPE along with plastic matte cover. It is quiet big like having two black and glowing eggs attached to ears but its worth cause the big egg things has lot of BASS inside LOL.
The battery life is incredible, I have been using it since yesterday and it still have 50% battery left.
ONLY PROBLEM is that I found the audio has sharp voice somewhat maximised to keep up with that heavy bass, like when you hear a song you will hear the vocals in sharp voice which is not actually pleasant. I counter this problem by using an equilizer in phone and laptop by decreasing the 14 KHz to some level and increasing 910 Hz to some level. And it only happens in bluetooth mode, The aux is perfect though.
Apart from all this I love my new headphone, Zebronics done a fabulous job by making it and selling it in such an affordable price.; "

Features a USB-C connection; Connector type: USB Type C; User hearing protection : Jabra safe Tone 2.0","Very good and genuine product. Original packaging ‚úåÔ∏è; This is a good product, trust me. But I have many issues with this as I have been using Jabra Evolve 20 for over 2 year.

Pros:
- The call quality with Jabra is excellent. They never go wrong with any of their products.
- Noise cancellation on speakers is good. They call it passive noise cancellation. Basic the earpieces are so designed that it is like you keeping your hands over your ears. Does reduce some sound, without a doubt. At first I thought it was a marketing gimmick, but you will see that because of the design you see some reduction in noise. The mic is not noise cancelling, but being Jabra the quality is much better than other products.
- The type C variant is quite good. I use this for calls not just on my laptop but also on phones. For Evolve 20 I had to use a type A to type C converter. This one being type C is much easier to connect.
- The build is good, the design is sturdy, the case is very nice.
- Mic gets muted when pulled up. This is an excellent feature! And what is more, when connected to a laptop it says muted/unmuted when you mute/unmute. EXCELLENT feature for when in meetings and you forget to mute yourself. You cannot go wrong with this.

Cons:

- Wire Length: The best part about Evolve 20 was that it had a long wire. This is just regular sized. Compared to other products, no different. The length is standard. But compared to Evolve 20, its a disappointment. I loved the ability to move around while in meetings.

- Call Controls: The call controls on your right earpiece. I am really not a fan of that design. With evolve 20, the design was a circular wheel with buttons in the middle of the wire. It was way more convenient. However, with the mic getting muted when pulled up I cannot really complain that much. Increasing or decreasing the sound is a bit inconvenient though.

- Mic Placement - Perhaps my greatest complaint with this device is that the mic is on the right side. With Jabra Evolve 20, the mic could rotate either forward or backward. So you could wear the mic side towards left and pull the mic forward; or wear the mic side towards right ear and pull the mic forward. This mic can only be pulled one side. So if you are wearing the mic side on your left year, the mic will actually pull down not in front but towards the back of your neck. And having the mic and controls on the right side is extremely inconvenient while in meeting, making notes, or doing anything at all on your laptop.

Overall it is a good product, it is definitely an improvement over Jabra Evolve 20 or even Jabra Evolve 40 but some ergonomic points could have been better.; Very poor noise cancellation on mic. Fan wind is audible to the other side.
Sound drops every 30 sec for 2 sec time period each when weatching yourtube or any other audio vedio.; It's heavy to hear attest 30 mins to use. Not Teams certified. But it's working. But heard to use.; There is distorted voice in head phone in between meeting. Jabra support is very poor. They said nobody makes purchase from Gadget hub. They force to buy headset from headsetindia.com. There is no support saying Gadget hub is not their authorized reseller.; This headphone is not worth the money. Mediocre quality and poorly built. Lot of sound leakage. Plastic used seems to be too cheap. Never expected this from jabra; I had always been against wearing over-ear headphones as they are usually oversized, heavy, hot and the weight on my neck usually causing headaches afterwards. Since the pandemic, online meetings have become an essential way of communicating at work and keeping in touch with loved ones, I am so pleased that I found this new generation of Jabra on-ear headphones. It is lightweight, great-looking, comfortable, provides sufficient noise cancellation and clear sound. I have tried the Evolve2 30 originally because worrying about Evolve2 40 may be too heavy for me. But I was convinced by the larger speakers that delivered a much clear sound than Evolve2 30 and the weight is acceptable which did not cause me headache or neck pain even after wearing it for 5 to 7 hours a day with 3 to 4 small breaks in between. I highly recommend it.; I had high expectations on these but didn't need them.

Well built headphones, reasonably comfortable but volume if people on other end wasn't very loud and could be get them louder. I had been using a cheaper JBL Headphones before these and went back to them after this.

Reasonably comfortable meant they were soft ear pads but small and we're good but not great. I understand the more you pay the better the features are. I need them for Zokm calls which can go for up to 90-120mins per call and I struggled with these after the second call in a row.
So if you are on calls for longer periods, pay for better than these.

So no good for longer calls and volume wasn't very loud for average caller. Louder callers maybe but you need clear louder earphones to hear all what
t he caller says then choose another set if headphones.; Dans le cadre de mon travail avec l‚Äôordi et vid√©oconf√©rence, mes coll√®gues ont remarqu√©s la qualit√© de mon son. Je connais pas d‚Äôautres casques, mais Jabra est une tr√®s bonne qualit√© et pour le prix je suis tr√®s satisfaite!!! Le casque vient avec un √©tui et il est l√©ger. Je recommande vivement!; I bought this as substitute for my Jabra Evolve 40 that I use during online meetings and gaming during weekends. This headset works great but I miss the flexibility of the Evolve 40 that has external controls to mute, increase and decrease your volume (the round control), this version Evolve2 40 has great sound and works with USB-C, but you need to control partly with the software you are using which is overwhelming during gaming, not as simple as it used to be.

If this version is paired with the round controller (from Evolve 40 first version) that can mute and has volume control externally, this will be almost perfect headphone for daily, work and light gaming use.; Great, light headset for professional folk. I got the usb c one which seems to be the norm now and I use mine with a MAC. Lots of setting to customize on the software. I didn't feel discomfort while trying it for about an hour though the reviews here complain about this. I have a large head."

In low cost enjoy music very nice loud.......
I purchased it Rs 599/- only.; I got it for 799/- within 24 hrs. Using it for 10 days now, don't have much complaints. I will sum up in pros and cons after my experience with the earphones. Reducing 1 star for the first CON in my review below.
PROS:
1) Cheaper than some of the other earphone brands with 12 months warranty as well.
2) Good Audio quality, I found it was better sounding than an Over the Ears Headphones I have from Cosmic Byte (G4000). Clear sound and good audio reproduction.
3) Battery life serves good at least for my taste as I am not a heavy user (I generally use it 2hours a day max.). Just FYI, I have charged the earphones twice in 10 days.
4) Comfortable earphones with very less weight and good ear fit.
5) Mic quality for calls is decent, not much noise cancellation for background noise but whatever is sent through is very clear and accurate.
CONS:
1) Biggest con for me personally is that I can't watch online youtube or twitch videos with this one (usually have to go 360p or lower for smoother experience) as it hampers the wifi speed on my mobile when connected to the mobile via bluetooth. This is happening because my wifi router is 2.4Ghz and it is interferring with the bluetooth signal to reduce internet speeds. A simple 5Ghz router would solve this issue, but as I don't have it, its become an issue. Also, I can tell if you run videos from mobile internet then you don't face this issue.
2) Only SBC bluetooth audio format supported hence not the best audio quality.
3) Left and Right ear plugs always confuse me while wearing it on, also the length of left and right side is not exactly the same, slight mismatch is present, which goes to show poor quality checks from the company.
4) Battery life could have been better or atleast charge time should have been reduced. It takes 1.5 hrs charge time for 6-8hrs battery life.
5) Battery indicator is very wrongly calibrated. From 100 to 70% discharging, it takes 5-6 hrs playtime, while from 70 to 10% it takes just 30 odd minutes. This again shows poor quality checks from the company.; i am using this last 4 years still its doesn't have any problem in sound ,bass, backup anything. Go for it. I love it.; Good overall; High price but average quality not very good not very bad; Overall performance is good and value for money product; Battery backup okay sound is clear but need vibrations when incoming call; This neckband is good quality is impressive build quality is also good but eartips and cable is missing from box . They forget to pack them . Otherwise this neckband is 4 star

Edit . I found eartips and cable actually they got dropped when I open it but this is not of use tips are small and big and cable has no quality even it does work yes the cable is not working
. So I would say battery backup is good . Bass is also good but calling is very very good . I can't expect that this earphones speak full number when call came .. value for money go for it"

Connect the 3.5mm jack to the phone and wait for a few seconds for the product to get sync with the phone. Water Resistant : Yes; The snug-fit also ensures a passive noise cancellation so that you can bask in the pure audio experience.; Impedance 16 Œ©; Frequency response 20Hz-20kHz; Cable length 1.2m; Country of Origin: China,"I recently purchased the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones, and while they offer decent sound quality and a comfortable fit, there are some concerns regarding their durability.

Let's start with the positives. The earphones provide a snug fit, ensuring comfort even during long listening sessions. The 10mm drivers deliver satisfactory sound performance, allowing you to enjoy your favorite music and audio with clarity. The passive noise cancellation feature is an added bonus, as it helps immerse you in your audio experience by reducing external noise distractions.

Connecting the earphones to your device is a straightforward process. Simply plug in the 3.5mm audio jack, and within a few seconds, the earphones sync with your phone or tablet, ready to deliver audio.

On the downside, the build quality of the earphone cable raises concerns. Some users have reported that the wires are not as sturdy as expected, making them susceptible to damage and tangling. This weakness in the wire construction may impact the longevity of the earphones, requiring extra care and attention during use and storage.

The ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones come in a sleek design and are available in multiple color options, including Black, Blue, Green, Red, and White, allowing you to choose the one that suits your style.

In terms of technical specifications, the earphones have an impedance of 16 Œ© and a frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz. The 1.2-meter cable length provides adequate flexibility for comfortable usage.

It's important to note that these earphones come with a 6-month warranty, which provides some assurance in case of any manufacturing defects or malfunctions within the specified period.

In conclusion, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones offer decent sound quality and a comfortable fit, making them suitable for everyday use. However, the durability concerns surrounding the wire strength are worth considering. If you prioritize longevity and robustness in your earphone choice, you may want to explore other options. Nevertheless, if you handle them with care, these earphones can provide an enjoyable audio experience at an affordable price point.; The ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones present a mixed bag of features, catering to both audio quality enthusiasts and comfort seekers. With a snug fit and 10mm drivers, these earphones ensure a comfortable listening experience coupled with satisfactory sound performance. The passive noise cancellation feature enhances immersion by minimizing external distractions, ideal for music aficionados or those seeking solace in audiobooks during commutes.

Connecting these earphones is hassle-free, thanks to the straightforward plug-and-play mechanism. However, concerns arise regarding the durability of the earphone cable. Users have reported issues with wire sturdiness, highlighting susceptibility to tangling and damage. While the sleek design and color variety add aesthetic appeal, the compromise in build quality prompts cautious handling to prolong their lifespan.

Despite durability concerns, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones boast technical specifications such as a 16 Œ© impedance and a frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz. The 1.2-meter cable offers adequate flexibility for daily use. Additionally, the inclusion of a 6-month warranty provides reassurance against potential manufacturing defects, offering peace of mind to consumers.

In summary, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones deliver a comfortable fit and decent sound quality, suitable for regular use. However, prospective buyers should weigh the durability issues against their preferences. While these earphones offer an enjoyable audio experience at an affordable price point, those prioritizing longevity may opt for alternatives with sturdier construction. Nonetheless, with proper care, these earphones serve as a budget-friendly option for casual listeners.; The product is working except in Video Calls on WhatsApp; It's a good earphone with good quality music and base offered in this price range
But not for long use because of the thin wire it can break at any time
By the it's comfortable to wear to it and also is a good fit for small ear as well
The quality and Clarity in mic is just ok in this price; Sound quality is good but it's not very durable but I guess it's understandable for that price"

It seemed interesting - and had something called DIRAC Opteo in it + ANC. So I thought I'd give it a shot.
First-day impressions - it's blown me away!

Exhaustive list of impressions:
1. DIRAC OPTEO: Balanced sound with punchy bass! Yeah, and not booming bass. It's so great and I'm quite surprised it sounds like something you'd expect at a higher price point.
1.1 Soundstage: As soon as the headphone is switched on, it starts in 'battery saving mode'. Once you turn on DIRAC Opteo mode, you can literally feel the space opening up. All the instruments feel individual and sound separated. Fireflies (by Owl City) sounds lovely and all the strings sway in the centre while the various zaps and buzzes surround you. It's really great for the price!
1.2 Treble and Mids: Clean and clear. The bass doesn't overpower them and feels just right. The vocals come out clearly and all the instruments don't interfere with it (Drive home by Steven Wilson sounds great!).
1.3 Bass: Punchy and tight. I love how it fizzles in 'Bonfire' (by Knife Party) and how it reverberates in 'Turn Down for what' (by DJ Snake). 'Breakin' a Sweat'(by Skrillex, Zedd) sounded tight and I discovered how well produced it is! Lovers of tight bass, this is your product!
2. Volume: It gets really loud. So loud that I can't listen to it at the highest setting. But if that's your thing, then you should know that the highs get pretty shrill at the setting, but the bass is still pretty clean and loud!
3. ANC: ANC is present, but won't drown everything out. It's a great add on but if you're looking for a headphone to make all sounds around you zero, then this won't do that. If you need to drown out some noise while you listen to your tunes, this will do the trick!
3.1 Ambient Sound mode: The opposite of ANC, it pulls in the outside noise to let you have a conversation. Again, you can't blast tunes at high volume and still have a convo, but you can listen with lower volume (near 25% volume) and hear things around you. If the ambient sound also increased as I increased volume, it would have been amazing.
4. Calling: Did a couple of calls. With no-noise, the other person said I sounded great! I took a couple of calls in a local grocery store (was pretty loud) and the other end had no issue hearing me.
5. Buttons: The button placement is easy and I didn't feel any issue getting used to the controls. The simple manual explains everything in 2 mins, so read once and you're good to go.
5.1 To note: The sound is best in DIRAC Opteo mode. Every time you turn it on, you have to double press the multi function button to turn it on. I'd have loved having it on by default. Also every time I turn it on, it plays a 3-4 second tune, which could have been shorter. (Imagine hearing it every time you turn the thing on. Ugh.)
6. Connectivity: Once I connected it to my phone the first time, it connects to my phone within 1-2 seconds of turning the earphones on.
7. Battery: It seems to last long! I've been using them for about 4.5 hrs and it's gone down about 20%. Cannot say anything more yet though.
7.1 When you take both the earphones out of your ears, it doesn't auto pause like some of the competitors. Annoyed that this was missed, would have saved so much more battery if they did this.
8. Build quality: I have a black version. It's made with good quality plastic and didn't feel heavy around my neck. It doesn't have metal anywhere, and it's quite simple. I think it looks decent.
9. Exercise: Need to test! Will update later.

In summary, an easy recommendation. If you can overlook the small issues, there's a great sounding, feature-packed and long lasting device here at a great price! 10/10 would definetely recommend!; I'm using this neckband since a year without any problem. It's good sound quality and long lasting battery life really justifies it's price .; ; Edit: Mic became useless within a month. Need to shout loudly to let other person hear me.

Original review:
Let's do away with the good parts first.
Build quality
Looks
Ear fitting
Microphone quality
ENx (the other side hears you clearly, with the noise around decently suppressed).
Ambient mode: lets your hear your surrounding as loud as without plugging it in the ears.
Battery backup (Just fine, 8-10 hours, including 4-5 hours of online meetings, calls).

Now the Not Good:
Battery: Expected a lot better. It's no better than a local Rs.250 neckband.
Bionic sound mode: Not completely useless, but makes it just 'bearable'. Without it you'd want to throw it away if you like music, not just an overly booming version of its bass alone.
ANC: This one again is not completely useless, but also not sufficient enough to call it 'decent'. Note that it's only for music or gaming mode. Has no effect over voice calls. ENx handles that (so the other person hears you, not the noise around you), and it seems to be present in non ANC models too, just as good.

The Bad now:
Sound quality: Loses 'Everything' in the music that is pleasant.
Charging cable: It's just a bad joke in the name of ""cable"". Just a 4 inch long flat cable piece, with the √Ä type USB head being iron not even steel. Sticks tightly with the magnet within the box.

The Very Bad:
Ultra ugly bass: Yes, some 'may' like its overdone, over booming, painfully over amplified bass, but I bet even the craziest of those can't stand it for more than half an hour. It simply overshadows Everything! Including simple voice calls! The voice of the other person sounds extra heavy.

So, practically, the cheapest wired earphone found on streets will have better audio quality if you want to hear anything other than the over amplified bass. I like bass, enjoy the deep bass in movies. But man! It's not what this one delivers. You can't enjoy music, or movies. Not sure what they consider it good for.

You also can't wear it in your ears for continuously 5-6 hours everyday. It'll start hurting, even at low volumes. So basically, it's only good for voice calls, and that too only because its microphone+ENx together are really good quality. Just use it during calls, online meetings, then immediately take it out of your ears, leave it hanging around your neck. Maybe keep one loosely plugged (that how I'm using it) to be aware of notification sounds.

If using it for work from home situations, you may have to charge it at least once everyday. Though it's charging is superfast even through laptop USB port."

We can hear outside noise. So we can judge if any other vehicle coming near and give a sign for overtake using horn. We can use as a neckband or airpod.; Writing this review after 45 days of using. Still works great except few bugs sometimes (rarely).

PROS:
The sound quality is great for price, average battery life, very comfortable to my ears, pretty fast bluetooth connectivity, connects with multiple devices with no problem

CONS:
It kinda lags a bit when you move while wearing it, but its not disturbing as it stops quickly. It lags heavily if you move away from your phone in like 2 meters. The radius is really low. The volume increasing/decreasing function only works in my laptop. There is a slight latency for first few seconds after you connect it. And it has this useless mode called ""gaming mode"", which on turning on, a guy says ""time to fight"" or smth in an optimus prime voice.; Didn't actually believe these earbuds would be so good. The bass is just awesome and the music is so clear and even if there is a loud noise outside can't hear it at all....
Really worth buying these buds for the price. They fit and feel very light on the ears. Looks are good. Pairing is simple. Connectivity is good so far.; Serves its purpose, you are aware of the surrounding while wearing it. But it tends to hurt your ears soon. Battery back is good , touch response is accurate, good aesthetics. Sound quality is good keeping in view that these are not in ear. Bass is average as compared to in ear which is obvious however in quiter places good bass can be felt. Yes you can run wearing these not going to fell in any instances.; Everything is good but value of money
No Dual Pairing Option avilable, No app control features avilable, Sound Quality good but bass is not good; Colour is very good and his finishing such a very precious look like very premium and very awesome and backup is very good; Best value for money pods which doesn't go inside the ear. Great for communication. Decent bass. Music volume enough for light listeners. Will definitely recommend for those who has ear irritations with pods which go inside the ear. Lightweight. Doesn't feel heavy after long usage.; From price point of view, this over the ear earphones perform well with decent sound volume keeping ear health in mind.

The major problem I faced is it's not comfortable to wear for longer duration. It starts paining. It might need time to get used to perhaps.
Those looking for noise cancellation feature, this doesn't have that. But good for those who are health conscious."
