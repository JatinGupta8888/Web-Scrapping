Bei vielen anderen Sofortbildkameras geht es nur um die Momentaufnahme - bei der mini 99 jedoch gibt es viele kleine Feinheiten, die beim Fotografieren richtig Spaß machen.
Sie ist optisch ein richtiger Blickfang und fühlt sich dazu auch sehr hochwertig an. Durch die verschiedenen Einstellräder oder das verstellbare Objektiv hat man ein richtiges analoges Bediengefühl.
Ich bin ein großer Fan von den Farbeffekten. Hiermit sieht jedes Sofortbild nach etwas besonderem aus, egal wie einfach das Motiv war.
Von der Qualität der Bilder bin ich ebenfalls sehr begeistert.
Diese Sofortbildkamera ist wirklich für jeden geeignet. Fotografen, die ein wenig mit Funkionen, wie Langzeitbelichtung oder Doppelbelichtung, spielen möchten, aber auch für ""Anfänger"", da die Standardeinstellungen schon tolle Bilder liefern!; J'adore la photo et j'ai globalement suivi l'évolution du marché depuis le milieu des années 90 : les appareils argentiques jetables de mon enfance, les compacts numériques, une montée en gamme en passant au bridge puis au reflex, sans compter les smartphones toujours plus performants. Résultat : des milliers, peut-être des dizaines de milliers de photos qui dorment dans des disques durs, des clés usb... et que je ne regarde jamais ou presque.

L'instax, malgré son aspect plastique cheap en main, malgré ses caractéristiques médiocres sur le papier (un 60 mm f/12,7) procure le plaisir unique de l'instantané et de la photo qui se dessine peu à peu sous vos yeux. Elle devient tout de suite un objet tangible qui crée du lien, et même une émotion liée à son imperfection (à la manière d'un vinyle). Car le but n'est pas d'égaler la précision des appareils numériques mais de créer des photos plus authentiques, dans un style très vintage. Les maniaques du piqué, passez votre chemin : oui il y aura du flou, de la surexposition, des photos complètement loupées... mais c'est aussi le jeu. Et ce doit être compliqué pour quelqu'un qui n'a jamais connu l'argentique. Il faut vraiment gérer la lumière et ne pas chercher des compositions trop compliquées avec de trop fortes dynamiques : c'est voué à l'échec. Mais on apprend et si on se fait avoir au début, on sort ensuite des clichés plus satisfaisants avec beaucoup de charme.

De plus, l'instax mini 99 constitue une évolution par rapport aux autres modèles et propose un peu plus de contrôle sur les photos : les filtres de couleur, le réglage de la luminosité, le vignetage, 3 niveaux de mise au point, le contrôle du flash, plusieurs modes (intérieur, sport, double exposition, bulb). Cela décuple les possibilités créatives !

Bref, oubliez la technique trop compliquée, oubliez les smartphones qui corrigent trop et profitez d'un appareil à mi-chemin entre la tradition et la modernité qui vous redonnera le sourire.; Vraiment un immense plaisir à utiliser !; it is easy to use，vantage style. but It doesn't look as good as the Mini 90. The improvement over the Mini 90 is not significant, and the price might be a bit high. Personally, I think a reasonable price for this machine would be around $150.; The newest of Fuji's Instax range the 99 is a big bulky camera that uses the standard Instax film (it doesn't come with any film so I bought a pack for use with the camera). As with other Instax cameras it doesn't offer the option to print borderless unlike the Kodak Mini Shot range. It features macro & landscape capabilities (accessed by turning the lens) as well light/darkness compensation. I didn't use the camera with the App as I feel the camera should be able to do what I want in camera. The advertising tends to emphasise the novelty features (colour effects, vignetting etc) .
Having tried it on macro I found that when using flash it would focus past the subject. Without flash it struggled with image definition and tended to wash out details.
When taking shots outside (see attached photograph) it struggled with definition and contrast. The first of the three photos was taken on ""N"" and then using the light/darkness compensation dial for the last two. The shots are either too bright or too dark (the sun was behind and to the side).
Overall picture quality is variable (out of twenty shots there wasn't one that was particularly good), the camera build is plastic and bulky and I feel is overpriced."
Fujifilm Instax Wide 300 Instant Camera- WHITE,"6,999",https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo1ODI2NjQzMzEwNDQ4MTc1OjE3MTkyMTQ3NTE6c3BfYXRmOjIwMDk2NjEwNzg4ODk4OjowOjo&url=%2FFujifilm-Instax-Wide-Instant-Camera%2Fdp%2FB085893CCH%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2_sspa%3Fcrid%3D4JBM3GA1T7F5%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.X0BDLWsnuDGIJWy5e5VTQZSQ-Zo6YHRSQjpLBytpQogRqjKvaWaw6yy8Ptzmxvrh3U-VGJnXhczGx1Uz2efO8u5_KjyevthnrJj4pc4dYnZK0SEegi7hbde71RDIqPZXBHG9U7Q_iwxA1mOLj_JF_VMD_-FKCO9tbxMpXLOokwJIa3e1HV-EMVH0HszXhUP8o9OfVP0EgKKGwJQ4J75KJ1adQORgioPYefS4KkYpiEk.3tgCh6JQMEGzVW65k93AMNw6TLfd4QVOanNzn39j1M0%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3Dold%2Banalog%2Bfilm%2Bcameras%26qid%3D1719214751%26sprefix%3Dold%2Banalog%2Bfilmcameras%252Caps%252C213%26sr%3D8-2-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mflhdLssL._SX355_.jpg,"The Fujifilm instax WIDE 300 is our largest format instax camera; Built in flash & fill in flash mode; Film size 108 (w) x 86 (H) cm. Twice as wide as instax mini film; Improved ease of use of the camera includes a tripod socket, focal zoom dial and user friendly interface; Two mode focusing, normal (0.9 m-3 m) and landscape (3 m plus); Programmed electronic shutter release, 1/64 sec - 1/200 sec","I love this camera. I was torn between this and the fuji mini 90 neo. But I am glad i chose this one. I love wide films and the pictures come out very well. The facial features and the background etc are clearly visible. My sister has the fuji neo, and though it is better looking, the pictures are so small. And definitely not worth a memory
This camera has a plastic feel to it but its durable. Selfies however do not come out that well with this camera. It doesn't have many features, but it's definitely worth a buy. I have bought 8 films upto now and i love using it.; Good camera ,its wide ,aesthetic but the film is not available abundantly; It appears there are concerns about the camera's bulkiness, malfunctioning lens, and limited exchange policies specifically for damaged bodies, with no consideration for other issues and no overall return policy, only allowing exchanges; I liked the easy operation of loading and taking the photos. In bright sunlight, I suggest to use the darken mode. Photos are clear and colours, vivid and accurate. Against a white background, photos tend to overexpose. Selfie, close up mirror is easy to attach. Landscape photos are the most accurate and pleasing.; It is a great thing to carry while travelling.
Pros:
- sturdy
- simple mechanism
- great puctures in daylight
- instant giveaways to people you meet

Cons
- bulky size, more than an avg DSLR
- pictures with flash tend to be devoid of info, background is often lost in it
- inability to work well in dim light
- expensive films, each picture costs around 55INR.

Having said that, i personally enjoy owning this camera. It is bulky as compared to Instax mini models but the picture size is definately substantial and gives a feeling of nostalgia (I owed a Mini 70). It is departure from the 100 pictures we take from the phone and barely ever look back to.; Amazing ! Amazing! Amazing camera! Fabulous features with light mode adjustments. It’s value is even quite in the range for people.I got it during the amazon sale period for really cheap! It's really worth buying coz this one gives you bigger proportionate pictures unlike the small ones. It’s quite simple to use and gives the most fabulous results in open areas. The quality of the picture is also without a doubt really good. I have had previous experiences with polaroid camera but this one is by far the best I have come across. It's really great choice for people who wish to buy a Polaroid camera; As an moderately experienced photographer owning a DSLR and an SLR, having an instant camera was just for fun and the instax wide 300 is a great buy if you just want to have some fun. However if you’re looking to get creative with this particular model of the instax line up, you’ll be let down. It doesn’t even have a timer.
I personally never found myself needing the timer, but for those of you who do will have to look for something else.
In the film cartridge department, the wide cartridges are quite limited for now and as it seems they don’t look like they are going to introduce any new fun cartridges.; At first I really enjoyed the wide shots and the picture quality was decent. Eventually after a couple of uses it just stopped working. No idea why,; I looove the Polaroid wide3000. Packaged neatly, came in perfect condition. Works fine, love that it came with the selfie attachment as well. Tried it as soon as I opened it, I was so excited. Only tricky part was figuring out how to attach the neck attachment. Would definitely recommend buying; Got this from my daughter. She loves it. Has a lot of fun with it. So far so good.; La compre como regalo y no le fue difícil a quién la recibió aprender a usarla, además que toma muy buenas fotos con el toque vintage que le da al ser instantáneas.; Há tempos queria uma máquina de foto instantânea e a escolha foi perfeita! Maior foto de todas as existentes! Tem uma lente com espelho para selfie. Único ponto negativo: o manual não tem língua portuguesa, mas tem espanhol.; Buenísimo cámara de foto instantánea, fue un regalo para mi hija. Inicialmente compré otra cámara de otra marca muy conocida, pero no nos gustó nada las fotos que hacia, eran de mala calidad así que juntos decidimos cambiarla por esta Instax Wide. Y el cambio fue todo un acierto: esta cámara hace unas fotos de una calidad más que aceptable. Buena resolución y buena luz. Como contras diría que el papel no es barato, y que funciona con pilas desechables, no se puede cargar, lo que no es nada ecológico. Aún así, recomiendo su compra si quieres disfrutar de unas fotos instantáneas chulas."

Estoy muy feliz con la compra. Al ser de doble exposición se ahorra mucho en rollos. Me encanta!; I bought this to take with me on a Europe trip. I wasted a couple shots at the beginning of the roll because the counter isn't super clear when it starts, but not a huge deal; you get 72 vertical shots per roll of 35mm film. I used Kodak Color Plus 200 ISO & am happy I went with that ISO. This camera does not do well in low-light--it couldn't capture a brightly lit Eiffel Tower. It does have flash option, but I opted not to use it.

This camera is compact & light enough that I was able to have it in my cross-body bag along with my phone, passport/wallet, & portable battery along with a few other random things. It survived 5 countries and a week of train travel! I prefer shooting with natural light & I think this camera + film selection was great for getting those types of compositions.

I did not opt for prints when I got the roll developed, but it was a little bit more for development & scanning since it's a half-frame camera. I got 72 4x6 shots on one roll. These photos will be portrait by default, the opposite of a regular camera.; I've gone through my fair share of point-and-shoot cameras and this one has been the best by far. While it is made of plastic and therefore feels a bit cheap, it still does the trick and has lasted longer than any of my other plastic cameras.

Since its instructions are simple, it is suitable for all analog hobbyists.; 📷 Built-in Flash: Turning on the flash by adjusting the silver ring around the lens so that you can use KODAK EKTAR H35 during days and nights, outdoor and indoor.; 📷 Four colours: Black, brown, sage and sand. Neat and natural.; 📷 Perfect for Beginners: The point-and-shoot camera is easy to use for new analogue hobbyists.","La regalé a mi pareja y la llevamos a todos los viajes, es muy ligera y fácil de usar, y las fotos salen preciosas! Estoy muy feliz con la compra. Al ser de doble exposición se ahorra mucho en rollos. Me encanta!; I bought this to take with me on a Europe trip. I wasted a couple shots at the beginning of the roll because the counter isn't super clear when it starts, but not a huge deal; you get 72 vertical shots per roll of 35mm film. I used Kodak Color Plus 200 ISO & am happy I went with that ISO. This camera does not do well in low-light--it couldn't capture a brightly lit Eiffel Tower. It does have flash option, but I opted not to use it.

This camera is compact & light enough that I was able to have it in my cross-body bag along with my phone, passport/wallet, & portable battery along with a few other random things. It survived 5 countries and a week of train travel! I prefer shooting with natural light & I think this camera + film selection was great for getting those types of compositions.

I did not opt for prints when I got the roll developed, but it was a little bit more for development & scanning since it's a half-frame camera. I got 72 4x6 shots on one roll. These photos will be portrait by default, the opposite of a regular camera.; I've gone through my fair share of point-and-shoot cameras and this one has been the best by far. While it is made of plastic and therefore feels a bit cheap, it still does the trick and has lasted longer than any of my other plastic cameras.

The best part, however, is that it takes 2 photos per film frame which means you get double the amount of photos. 36 exposures = 72 pictures. film is expensive these days so this is something I can really appreciate.

No complaints over here! Happy customer; Schöne, handliche Retrokamera mit super BIldqualität.
Ich habe die Kamera anstatt einer Sofortbildkamera gewählt, weil sie viel handlicher ist.
Das kleine Format macht es besonders attraktiv.
Super um schöne Momente festzuhalten!

Die Filme sind jedoch recht teuer, muss es einem schon wert sein.; Facil de usar"

There is two problems I ran into so far. I use 36 exp. Films for everything, so you can imagine my surprise when I received my printed photos and it only said ""26 photos"" on the paper. This camera seems to have a shutter problem I think? maybe it stays stuck sometimes when you take the picture but that's a real bummer because I basically waste film by using this thing. The counter also seems to stay stuck sometimes because it just stops moving even after taking a bunch.

Also be careful while taking pictures indoors, I think that might be a me problem but I didnt use the flash at some point because we were in a fairly well lit room and the photos came out very underexposed.

Either way, it's a real bummer because it's a really cute and practical camera if you want to take quick point and shoots, but if you are willing to waste some of your precious film on it, go ahead :'); I’ve been needing an affordable compact camera and have been leaning towards film for a fun “toy camera” as someone else referred to this as. I’ve seen what it’s capable of, and am getting 2 rolls of high speed monochrome film (Ilford) tomorrow. 5 star delivery for sure and I love the pop up flash. I mainly bought this because I have a concert to go to where they probably won’t care about me sneaking in a camera, and it’s Death Grips before my birthday.
The viewfinder is clear. I know how to shoot film. If you know what you’re doing (Google is free and camera guys can help you out) it can be a great first camera for anyone. 😊; Tout est OK ! Merci !; Cheaper made than expected, film stock takes forever to insert.; Its a shame a great company from our past put its name on this product. Cheap, pictures turned out terrible"

I liked the product but the cartridge inside the camera was stuck when i took out the first print and hence entire cartridge got ruined. Can u send me a replacement cartridge only?; ; Every thing perfect about this product; DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT VERY VERY BAD QUALITY WASTE OF MONEY

++ I have been using instant cameras for a while hence choose Kodak in India as the photo sheets were easily available but that was a mistake

++ pathetic picture quality - I choose two of these kodak cameras as gifts to my nieces and now m so embarrassed as when they clicked pictures ( in day light and night ) I saw the horrible quality product which i got them as gift.

++The product is well build but do not go by pictures on the site its misleading \\

++ I cannot get my money refunded as they do not have return policy - of course why ...since they are selling a bad product; Away from this digital world where we can easily delete the pictures I always wanted a mini Polaroid camera to click and create amazing moments and memories and print instantly... And this camera is something which i loved and wanted from a long time... The compact looks and a good quality instant print adds a lot of value for the money that we spend... Thanks Kodak for making such a wonderful product... Loved using it!; ; Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing device but if you have a phone with a decent camera you should buy the Kodak 4 pass mini printer instead as you'll never end up using the camera aspect of this camera.; As the product is superb in quality of printing pictures, but the camera pixels is very low and the most disappointing thing is its battery backup. I can't print more than 5 photos in one full charge and even the camera is draining the battery when it is not in use; Very important to mention what I've called a quasi instant functionality. Unlike real instant cameras where you can make unintentional clicks and accidental photos (and even when it is intentional - it is not always what you've expected), here you are prevented from that. You are taking the picture, see the intermediate result on a tiny screen and only then you can print it if you want. If not - you can retake it, no film wasted. This is a perfect process for me.

Printing speed is very good (I read some complaints about that and don't get it), quality of the photo is very decent. Of cause, it is not a perfect full scale printing. But what could you expect from such a tiny box? It also adds that old-stile, less-technology, analogue vibe. The lack of internal storage - I think it is a plus. Otherwise, it is just a digital camera, but you already have a way more sophisticated one in your phone. And you can connect it and print from the phone.

We did just one cartridge, but I'me sure we will be shooting a lot on this camera.; This printer is not fast, as it does the four pass print. But the photos come out so good. I also have another brand mini photo printer and the quality of the Kodak is so much better. The only problem I have is the battery drains so fast, like after just a few printings. And the on switch takes several attempts to finally turn on, you have to hold your tongue a certain way I think 🤔. I've had an older models of this printer and never had either of these problems with them. Still, I prefer the prints from this printer over the other brand I have by far. And the app you download to use it is super user friendly and allows for editing, frames, collages and more.; Es una cámara muy buena, la calidad de las fotos dependen mas de la calidad del archivo que de la cámara, su lente es baste bajo o de gama baja te va a ser más útil de impresiona que de cámara en si. Pero si sabes de fotografía te resuelves el problema fácil, en resumen vale mucho la pena en verdad. Es increíble; Taşınabilir baskı makinesi olarak kullanıyorum baskı kalitesi çok iyi telefondan çekip bundan baskı alıyorum kendi kamerası da iyi fakat bazı durumlarda yetersiz kalıyor genel olarak 5/5; Lo bueno es poder imprimiras fotos desde la galería del teléfono móvil a travéz del bluetoot lo malo la calidad de las fotos no es tan buena"

Don’t think twice and buy it. It’s really worth it. I can just print whichever pic that I took long back. It looks classy and very handy.

It actually reminiscence early 2000s more then the 80’s though.. but it’s also great for saving some money on film, which is pretty expensive. The Wi-Fi feature is also great. Now you can also have physical copies of your old pictures.; Very cool and fun thing. Mostly we use it like a printer for printing pictures from phone. Very cute device!; ; The camera is easy to use the print out are not rich and would look washed out.
Though instant photo has its charm, I would recommend to go for less expensive options from.
Very expensive per photo cost but that would be same across the board.; when i receive product and i try to start camera there is no battery,then i charged and again try to start but there is no start up screen, in bluetooth setting already one device already paired ....i ordered brand new camera but i received used product; After replacing the item as it wasn't working (not able to print the pictures). After I replaced the item, again same thing is happening. Ot clocks the pictures but unable to print and also eating my films.

Very beginner friendly, very intuitive.
It has turned out to be very nice for capturing moments and giving aesthetic Instagram photo dumps.
However, what you are paying for with this camera is 100% the aesthetics. Other similar film cameras can be found for far cheaper.
Buy it if you like the CONCEPT of film photography above all else, and maybe you may sink deeper into the hobby.; This was my first film camera and I’ve had so much fun with it. It’s compact, durable and easy to use. The instructions are very easy to understand and you just load it up and go. I use Kodak 400 35mm film and I’ve shared some of my favorite shots. I’ve got to learn how lightning/flash situations work but I honestly love the underlit grainy vibe from my results. I’ve never regretted this purchase and love it so so much!

Just be aware, with all film there is the risk of light fog which means you can lose those moments forever on film. It’s not the cameras fault however, so always have a back up photography option in the moment ex: your phone. 10/10 ⭐️; desde cuándo quería una cámara con un diseño así.

As many have noted, this is very similar to a toy camera, but it actually takes some quite stunning photos! Everything is fixed, except for the option to turn on/off flash, so it truly is a point-and-shoot. Despite the simplicity, the photos turned out wonderfully! I used the Kodak Gold 200 Colour Film for my first-ever roll, and the pictures were great! This camera is really nice if you want to take your 'disposables' up a notch and not worry about having to throw away everything after a single-use. It's easy to pack into most bags and fanny packs for travel, and it's quite light to carry as well.

One thing I wanted to note: make sure to turn off the flash when you're not using the camera! I always, ALWAYS forget to turn it off, and it drains my battery like crazy. Keep your flash turned off unless you're using it.; me costó meter el carrete porque era la primera vez que tengo una cámara de estas pero funciona perfectamente, la recomiendo"

I am so happy that he liked it!; The camera worked great but after the first roll the teeth are no longer catching the film. I wasted two rolls trying to get it to work and no luck. Would never recommend this to anyone. It’s an expensive paperweight.; Normalerweise schriebe ich keine Produktbewertungen, aber in dem Fall sehe ich mich verpflichtet anderen vom Kauf abzuraten, außer euch ist die Verarbeitung und damit auch Langlebigkeit von dieser Kamera egal.

Erstmal was positives:
Ich weiß von guten Freunden, die diese Kamera auch schon seit Jahren benutzen, dass die Bilder einen coolen Wow Effekt haben können.
Wenn man weiß, was man machen muss, bekommt man coole Bilder raus, das ist sicher.
Soviel dazu.

Jetzt zur Verarbeitung:
Die Kamera ist ein kleines bisschen schwerer als erwartet, aber wirklich nur ganz wenig, ansonsten hält man halt nur Plastik in den Händen, leider ein sehr billiger Ersteindruck und leider wird es noch schlimmer...

Als ich die Kamera das erste Mal aus der Box genommen hab, ist mir sofort aufgefallen, dass sich die ""Lederverzierung"" vorne schon ein gutes Stück abgelöst hat, wie ein zu langer Fingernagel.
Darunter war der ausgetrocknete, alte Kleber zu sehen.

Und leider ist das nicht die Einzige RETO 3D bei der ich dieses Problem schon bemerkt hab.
Bei der Kamera meiner Freunde sieht das ganze noch viel schlimmer aus.
Staub, Dreck und Sand gelangen unter den Kleber und das nachgeahmte Plastik wölbt sich unschön hinauf.

Da meine Freunde ihre Kamera schon etwa 3 Jahre haben, dachte ich es würde daran liegen, dass sie sie viel benutzt haben, aber jetzt scheint es mir so, als wäre das Ganze einfach ein grober Designfehler.

Meine RETO Kamera schicke ich zurück, das ist mir die 60€ definitiv nicht wert.
Ich habe kein Vertrauen, dass die Kamera die nächsten Jahre überleben wird, kein bisschen.
Außerdem gibt es noch mehr analoge Kameras, die einen ähnlichen oder sogar besseren 3D Effekt erzielen können.
Zum Beispiel die Nishika N8000 3D oder Rittai Analog 3D.
Beide kosten gebraucht um die 100€-130€, sind aber qualitativ sicher besser aufgestellt als diese Kamera.
Auch wenn in diesem Fall die Messlatte sehr niedrig liegt.

Ich bin ein großer Fan von gut designten, langlebigen und schönen Produkte und finde es nicht zu viel verlangt, dass eine Kamera, die als neu angeboten wird, auch kurz nach dem auspacken, neu aussieht.

Wenn ihr das auch grundsätzlich so unterstreichen würdet, kauft lieber wo anders eine andere 3D Effekt Kamera.
Ihr werdet dann wahrscheinlich glücklicher, als mit der RETO 3D.; As a professional photographer, I have tested and reviewed the RETO3D 35mm Film Camera extensively. Here are my two positive points and two negative points about this product:

Positive Points:
1. Lenticular 3D effect - The RETO3D camera produces amazing 3D boomerang images that are unique and eye-catching. The lenticular effect adds depth to the images, making them stand out from traditional 2D images. It's a great feature for creative photography and capturing memorable moments in a unique way.
2. Built-in Flash - The RETO3D camera has a built-in flash that works well in low light situations. This is a great feature for indoor and nighttime photography. The flash produces well-lit images with good exposure and contrast.

Negative Points:
1. Limited controls - The RETO3D camera has limited controls with only fixed aperture and shutter speed settings. This can be frustrating for professional photographers who want more control over their images. However, it's a good option for beginners or those who want a simple and easy-to-use camera.
2. Film loading and rewinding - The RETO3D camera requires manual film loading and rewinding, which can be time-consuming and tricky for those who are not familiar with film cameras. It also requires purchasing and developing film, which can be a costly and time-consuming process.

Overall, the RETO3D 35mm Film Camera is a great option for those who want to experiment with 3D boomerang images and are willing to work with film cameras. It has some limitations in terms of controls and film handling, but it's a unique and fun camera to use for creative photography.; It feels nostalgic and it was a great gift to my girlfriend who loves taking pictures!"

Don’t think twice and buy it. It’s really worth it. I can just print whichever pic that I took long back. It looks classy and very handy.

Very cute device!; ; The camera is easy to use the print out are not rich and would look washed out.

Very expensive per photo cost but that would be same across the board.; when i receive product and i try to start camera there is no battery,then i charged and again try to start but there is no start up screen, in bluetooth setting already one device already paired ....i ordered brand new camera but i received used product; After replacing the item as it wasn't working (not able to print the pictures).

I liked the product but the cartridge inside the camera was stuck when i took out the first print and hence entire cartridge got ruined. Can u send me a replacement cartridge only?; ; Every thing perfect about this product; DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT VERY VERY BAD QUALITY WASTE OF MONEY

++ I have been using instant cameras for a while hence choose Kodak in India as the photo sheets were easily available but that was a mistake

++ pathetic picture quality - I choose two of these kodak cameras as gifts to my nieces and now m so embarrassed as when they clicked pictures ( in day light and night ) I saw the horrible quality product which i got them as gift.

++The product is well build but do not go by pictures on the site its misleading \\

++ I cannot get my money refunded as they do not have return policy - of course why ...since they are selling a bad product; Away from this digital world where we can easily delete the pictures I always wanted a mini Polaroid camera to click and create amazing moments and memories and print instantly... And this camera is something which i loved and wanted from a long time... The compact looks and a good quality instant print adds a lot of value for the money that we spend... Thanks Kodak for making such a wonderful product... Loved using it!; ; Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing device but if you have a phone with a decent camera you should buy the Kodak 4 pass mini printer instead as you'll never end up using the camera aspect of this camera.; As the product is superb in quality of printing pictures, but the camera pixels is very low and the most disappointing thing is its battery backup. I can't print more than 5 photos in one full charge and even the camera is draining the battery when it is not in use; Very important to mention what I've called a quasi instant functionality. Unlike real instant cameras where you can make unintentional clicks and accidental photos (and even when it is intentional - it is not always what you've expected), here you are prevented from that. You are taking the picture, see the intermediate result on a tiny screen and only then you can print it if you want. If not - you can retake it, no film wasted. This is a perfect process for me.

Printing speed is very good (I read some complaints about that and don't get it), quality of the photo is very decent. Of cause, it is not a perfect full scale printing. But what could you expect from such a tiny box? It also adds that old-stile, less-technology, analogue vibe. The lack of internal storage - I think it is a plus. Otherwise, it is just a digital camera, but you already have a way more sophisticated one in your phone. And you can connect it and print from the phone.

We did just one cartridge, but I'me sure we will be shooting a lot on this camera.; This printer is not fast, as it does the four pass print. But the photos come out so good. I also have another brand mini photo printer and the quality of the Kodak is so much better. The only problem I have is the battery drains so fast, like after just a few printings. And the on switch takes several attempts to finally turn on, you have to hold your tongue a certain way I think 🤔. I've had an older models of this printer and never had either of these problems with them. Still, I prefer the prints from this printer over the other brand I have by far. And the app you download to use it is super user friendly and allows for editing, frames, collages and more.; Es una cámara muy buena, la calidad de las fotos dependen mas de la calidad del archivo que de la cámara, su lente es baste bajo o de gama baja te va a ser más útil de impresiona que de cámara en si. Pero si sabes de fotografía te resuelves el problema fácil, en resumen vale mucho la pena en verdad. Es increíble; Taşınabilir baskı makinesi olarak kullanıyorum baskı kalitesi çok iyi telefondan çekip bundan baskı alıyorum kendi kamerası da iyi fakat bazı durumlarda yetersiz kalıyor genel olarak 5/5; Lo bueno es poder imprimiras fotos desde la galería del teléfono móvil a travéz del bluetoot lo malo la calidad de las fotos no es tan buena"

The fridge magnets are another good way to show your memories to the visitors. Though placing the magnet is a bit tricky.
I was looking at the Instax mini 11 before looking into pros and cons of both. Then this seemed like a better option for few extra bucks (with all the offers I got it for 10.4k approx).
*Give a thumbs-up if you like the review.; Easy to use, The print quality (from phone) is really good. Camera picture quality gets slightly out of focus/ undefined but decent when close to subject (the sound recording and frame option is only available in camera picture). One advantage of camera picture is that it doesn't print immediately, you can retake pics and choose the best to print - you can avoid under/over exposure this way (the rest can be stored in SD card). The photo book quality that comes along with this pack isn't great, so i bought another one. Over-all happy with my purchase.; Good packaging . Good quality . Go for it; Best in Instax mini Model.; The camera clarity is not at all good, though it can be used as a printer as it provides convenience of printing, one should rather go for only printer version from Fuji instead of camera; No doubt . .

The ones of people typically look better but I didn’t want to upload any identifying photos.; Para fotos tipo vintage... buenisima!!!; After developing 2 rolls of film, only about 5 of the photos came out worthy. The rest were extremely blurry and had to be thrown out. I'm not a beginner with photography and made sure to keep the camera still. Pictures are a bit better with flash but this camera is just not worth going through the hassle of film to have bad quality pictures on the other side; Imagine wanting a disposable camera, that isn't disposable, but is also very inexpensive and cute.
Wow you imagined the Ilford Sprite 35-II!
I attached a long string thing to it and wore it around my neck until I discovered that point and shoot cameras are meant to have a wrist strap so people can't see how you carry around mediocre cameras for strange hobbies. That being said, I have a wrist strap now.

I love this lil thing though, developing my 3rd roll of film from it and then trying out the HP5 iso 400 BW film around the city.

Anyway this is a nice gift for someone, or a nice gift for yourself, I've searched around the interwebs looking for what photos look like taken on this bad boy and NOT BAD Y'ALL.

Peace, love and pictures,
-Virginald; I really liked this camera at the beginning. It is lightweight and easy to use. However, it stopped working after my first film roll. Camera does not wind the film. It doesn’t function anymore and it is too late to return"

Eu amei minhas Fotos, cada foto é uma sensação de nostalgia 😍; I got this as my first film camera after not being sure if I’d like it and it’s perfect! Such a great price for what you get. Love the pictures; I had bought this as a gift for a loved one, with the intention of giving them an entrance into film photography. It is a point and shoot 35 mm with that disposable feel. Very beginner friendly, very intuitive.
It has turned out to be very nice for capturing moments and giving aesthetic Instagram photo dumps.
However, what you are paying for with this camera is 100% the aesthetics. Other similar film cameras can be found for far cheaper.
Buy it if you like the CONCEPT of film photography above all else, and maybe you may sink deeper into the hobby.; This was my first film camera and I’ve had so much fun with it. It’s compact, durable and easy to use. The instructions are very easy to understand and you just load it up and go. I use Kodak 400 35mm film and I’ve shared some of my favorite shots. I’ve got to learn how lightning/flash situations work but I honestly love the underlit grainy vibe from my results. I’ve never regretted this purchase and love it so so much!

Just be aware, with all film there is the risk of light fog which means you can lose those moments forever on film. It’s not the cameras fault however, so always have a back up photography option in the moment ex: your phone. 10/10 ⭐️; desde cuándo quería una cámara con un diseño así.
no me arrepiento de comprarla"

Since its instructions are simple, it is suitable for all analog hobbyists.; 📷 Built-in Flash: Turning on the flash by adjusting the silver ring around the lens so that you can use KODAK EKTAR H35 during days and nights, outdoor and indoor.; 📷 Four colours: Black, brown, sage and sand. Neat and natural.; 📷 Perfect for Beginners: The point-and-shoot camera is easy to use for new analogue hobbyists.","La regalé a mi pareja y la llevamos a todos los viajes, es muy ligera y fácil de usar, y las fotos salen preciosas! Estoy muy feliz con la compra. Al ser de doble exposición se ahorra mucho en rollos. Me encanta!; I bought this to take with me on a Europe trip. I wasted a couple shots at the beginning of the roll because the counter isn't super clear when it starts, but not a huge deal; you get 72 vertical shots per roll of 35mm film. I used Kodak Color Plus 200 ISO & am happy I went with that ISO. This camera does not do well in low-light--it couldn't capture a brightly lit Eiffel Tower. It does have flash option, but I opted not to use it.

This camera is compact & light enough that I was able to have it in my cross-body bag along with my phone, passport/wallet, & portable battery along with a few other random things. It survived 5 countries and a week of train travel! I prefer shooting with natural light & I think this camera + film selection was great for getting those types of compositions.

I did not opt for prints when I got the roll developed, but it was a little bit more for development & scanning since it's a half-frame camera. I got 72 4x6 shots on one roll. These photos will be portrait by default, the opposite of a regular camera.; I've gone through my fair share of point-and-shoot cameras and this one has been the best by far. While it is made of plastic and therefore feels a bit cheap, it still does the trick and has lasted longer than any of my other plastic cameras.

The best part, however, is that it takes 2 photos per film frame which means you get double the amount of photos. 36 exposures = 72 pictures. film is expensive these days so this is something I can really appreciate.

No complaints over here! Happy customer; Schöne, handliche Retrokamera mit super BIldqualität.
Ich habe die Kamera anstatt einer Sofortbildkamera gewählt, weil sie viel handlicher ist.
Das kleine Format macht es besonders attraktiv.
Super um schöne Momente festzuhalten!

Die Filme sind jedoch recht teuer, muss es einem schon wert sein.; Facil de usar"

I’ve given it to the daughter of my girlfriend, and she’s so happy about it, doesn’t disappoint.; I love this little camera, it takes me back to a wonderful moment in time. The con right off the bat is pictures are dark even with the flash so extra lighting is a must! I plan on using it for a photobooth and I coincidentally purchased a light so I'll be fine but just keep in mind when you purchase; This camera works very well. Would recommended to everybody that wants a polaroid camera; This camera is great. It is easy to use, you just unbox a pack of i-type film, insert into the film tray, remove the dark film protector which auto ejects after the film tray has been closed, and the camera is then ready to use.

There are two buttons on the back, one on the side, and two on the front. The back buttons are the on button and the flash button, there is also an LED indicator on the back which lets you know how many films you have left in the cartridge. The side button is used to open the film tray. The front buttons are for taking the photos, instant being the big red button and timed being the smaller stopwatch looking button.

When you take a photo, the film immediately ejects. I’ve found you have better results if you immediately place the film in a dark place. It takes 15-30 minutes for the film to develop but you can start to notice the photo forming after only a few. For a good photo you need really good lighting. I recommend always using the flash on top of making sure whatever you want to capture is lit up well.

I have been using this camera for a few days now and the charge is still green (which means full or near full).

All in all I highly recommend this camera if you are looking for quick film printed photos. The price is good for the quality you get and it’s highly satisfying taking a photo and watching it come out of the camera.

NOTE: This camera does not come with film included, if you decide to buy you need to make sure you buy the correct film type separately (I use i-type film).; Je cherchais un appareil qui me permettrait de retrouver le charme vintage d'avant. C'est chose fait. Facile d'utilisation, je recommande 😀"

Short review: Excellent, crazy fun camera. Pick one up!

Long, drawn out review: Buy one! The Reto Ultra Wide and Slim is a hoot to carry and shoot with. Super light and unobtrusive to carry anywhere. I did not understand the hype of the previous incarnations of this camera until I ran a few rolls through it. Super fun! You outta purchase one!

I am still waiting on the lab to send my film back, maybe this week. I am quite familiar with the lo-fi/ Lomo aesthetic in film photography (Holga's, Dianas, pinhole, 110 format, etc.), but I expect to be pleasantly surprised by the results of the RUWS. The results of this camera view online are compelling, if my shots are half as good I will be over the moon.

Even though I wish this camera had multiple exposure capability, and a hotshoe, and some exposure control, and on and on; I know in my heart it would ruin the experience. This is about as basic as it gets (a box that holds film) and it is up to me to use my skills and creativity as a photographer to create worthwhile photos. BTW, get one. No home should be without a RUWS!

Even though I have a number of cameras at my disposal, the RUWS most certainly will get the nod often. You should get one! Steal it if you must, lol.

In closing, just do it already. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.; Every roll of film I used in this camera was ruined or blank. The camera simply doesn’t work at all. I spent lots of money mailing film to be developed and both the camera and that process was a waste. Don’t buy this camera. I’ve tried many things to make it work and it just doesn’t.; Works perfectly; È un accessorio, carino, colorato, effetto retro sia nel design che nella resa degli scatti. Non ne caverete però immagini tecnicamente soddisfacenti, escono tutte scure anche scattate in piena luce.

Bei vielen anderen Sofortbildkameras geht es nur um die Momentaufnahme - bei der mini 99 jedoch gibt es viele kleine Feinheiten, die beim Fotografieren richtig Spaß machen.
Sie ist optisch ein richtiger Blickfang und fühlt sich dazu auch sehr hochwertig an. Durch die verschiedenen Einstellräder oder das verstellbare Objektiv hat man ein richtiges analoges Bediengefühl.
Ich bin ein großer Fan von den Farbeffekten. Hiermit sieht jedes Sofortbild nach etwas besonderem aus, egal wie einfach das Motiv war.
Von der Qualität der Bilder bin ich ebenfalls sehr begeistert.
Diese Sofortbildkamera ist wirklich für jeden geeignet. Fotografen, die ein wenig mit Funkionen, wie Langzeitbelichtung oder Doppelbelichtung, spielen möchten, aber auch für ""Anfänger"", da die Standardeinstellungen schon tolle Bilder liefern!; J'adore la photo et j'ai globalement suivi l'évolution du marché depuis le milieu des années 90 : les appareils argentiques jetables de mon enfance, les compacts numériques, une montée en gamme en passant au bridge puis au reflex, sans compter les smartphones toujours plus performants. Résultat : des milliers, peut-être des dizaines de milliers de photos qui dorment dans des disques durs, des clés usb... et que je ne regarde jamais ou presque.

L'instax, malgré son aspect plastique cheap en main, malgré ses caractéristiques médiocres sur le papier (un 60 mm f/12,7) procure le plaisir unique de l'instantané et de la photo qui se dessine peu à peu sous vos yeux. Elle devient tout de suite un objet tangible qui crée du lien, et même une émotion liée à son imperfection (à la manière d'un vinyle). Car le but n'est pas d'égaler la précision des appareils numériques mais de créer des photos plus authentiques, dans un style très vintage. Les maniaques du piqué, passez votre chemin : oui il y aura du flou, de la surexposition, des photos complètement loupées... mais c'est aussi le jeu. Et ce doit être compliqué pour quelqu'un qui n'a jamais connu l'argentique. Il faut vraiment gérer la lumière et ne pas chercher des compositions trop compliquées avec de trop fortes dynamiques : c'est voué à l'échec. Mais on apprend et si on se fait avoir au début, on sort ensuite des clichés plus satisfaisants avec beaucoup de charme.

De plus, l'instax mini 99 constitue une évolution par rapport aux autres modèles et propose un peu plus de contrôle sur les photos : les filtres de couleur, le réglage de la luminosité, le vignetage, 3 niveaux de mise au point, le contrôle du flash, plusieurs modes (intérieur, sport, double exposition, bulb). Cela décuple les possibilités créatives !

Bref, oubliez la technique trop compliquée, oubliez les smartphones qui corrigent trop et profitez d'un appareil à mi-chemin entre la tradition et la modernité qui vous redonnera le sourire.; Vraiment un immense plaisir à utiliser !; it is easy to use，vantage style. but It doesn't look as good as the Mini 90. The improvement over the Mini 90 is not significant, and the price might be a bit high. Personally, I think a reasonable price for this machine would be around $150.; The newest of Fuji's Instax range the 99 is a big bulky camera that uses the standard Instax film (it doesn't come with any film so I bought a pack for use with the camera). As with other Instax cameras it doesn't offer the option to print borderless unlike the Kodak Mini Shot range. It features macro & landscape capabilities (accessed by turning the lens) as well light/darkness compensation. I didn't use the camera with the App as I feel the camera should be able to do what I want in camera. The advertising tends to emphasise the novelty features (colour effects, vignetting etc) .
Having tried it on macro I found that when using flash it would focus past the subject. Without flash it struggled with image definition and tended to wash out details.
When taking shots outside (see attached photograph) it struggled with definition and contrast. The first of the three photos was taken on ""N"" and then using the light/darkness compensation dial for the last two. The shots are either too bright or too dark (the sun was behind and to the side).
Overall picture quality is variable (out of twenty shots there wasn't one that was particularly good), the camera build is plastic and bulky and I feel is overpriced."

Produces good colors; Print quality is very good with photos taken from mobile..but camer inbuilt camera is not that good; Rather than looking at it as a camera printer, consider it a printer camera. Because you may not be using the camera as often due to inherent limitations of instant cameras.; The product stopped working in 2 months; I was confused between Kodak and Fujifilm but ended up taking this and am very satisfied. My reasons for purchase were:
1. Brand image
2. Amazing process of printing
3. Best option in this price range
4. Lower cost of film roll compared to Fujifilm; I bought it for my anniversary picture and I am very happy with the product.The ease of access and the print quality is good.Only thing which can be improved is Kodak can give a larger screen and it becomes difficult to guess the exact background.
Pros-Photo filter for variation in photography,Can be paired with mobile and act as a printer,laminated insta pictures for better longer life
Cons-LCD screen size and quality can be improved,Little bit heavy
My verdict-One of the best insta camera.; Picture quality is not that great. Better with mobile photos. Easy & fun to use.; I actually buy this camera due to good review about picture quality but in actual print quality of photo very bad not as expected. Genuinely I feel like it's a waste of money...; Ótimo produto; During the year of use, I took 40 photos, some of them were spoiled by the camera, but in general, it is a very wonderful thing that will bring you a lot of good emotions.; Me agrada que no solo cumple con tomar fotos sino como una impresora de ellas, y de muy buena calidad.
La autonomía de la batería queda un poco corta pero sigue siendo un gran producto, solo tengan cuidado cuando inserten los cartuchos ya que se puede arruinar el mismo.; I rarely write reviews, but upon purchasing and using this product and seeing the onslaught of negative reviews, I had to sit down and type one out.

First, I do not understand the negative reviews. Maybe some critical thinking skills aren't being applied when others have bought this product. You see lots of ""My iPhone/Android camera takes better quality pictures!"" in the complaints. Let's dissect this. Most smartphones nowadays retail for nearly $1,000 in total, and a key element in their advertising is not only the quality of the built in cameras but the constant improves from model to model. Of course, a smart phone camera is going to produce better quality pictures. It's one of the reasons we spend our hard earned money on them. If all we needed was a device to call and text, we'd still be using flip phones. Let's put our thinking caps on and remember why the little computers in our pockets can take excellent if not astounding quality pictures - because they're built to!

Now, this Kodak camera does state it prints ""superior photo"" quality, but it does not boast ""state of the art"" quality or even ""smart phone"" quality, because it knows its place and that would be a flat out lie. Read the fine print, people! Superior does not automatically equate to breathtaking, especially when you look at the product itself. Once again, this is a basic camera/tool. It is not built to be an equal to a smartphone which is essentially, as I said, a mini-computer; It is not built to be an equal to even the lowest tier of professional photography cameras. It IS however, built to be a simple, basic photo taking device that you can also connect to your phone, iPad or other supported device if you choose to.

It does what it says on the box, so I am happy with this purchase. I suspect other customers were expecting something far more complex and souped up, and that is not what this camera is.

Now, the only cons I have for it is that printing process is a little slow, but it takes less than a minute. The paper quality is good though, so I'll let this slide. You can't have everything, especially if you're buying something that is quite budget when it comes to bells and whistles. And that's another thing I'd like to mention - this prints on modern day photo paper. Do not expect the thick, flimsy paper that actual polaroid cameras printed on. If that's what you're after, then you'll be better off heading over to eBay or a pawn shop.

This is a modern take on an old school favorite. Understand what you're buying, and you will be a satisfied customer.; La calidad de las fotos es muy buena y el tamaño es suficientemente grande, a diferencia de otras cámaras instantaneas que te imprimen como mucho tamaño similar al de una foto de carnet. Las funciones que tiene son bastante básicas, pero si lo que buscas es la simplicidad y facilidad de uso de las cámaras instantaneas retro no te hara falta más. Las impresiones son económicas y de buena calidad. Alternativamente con la App de Kodak en el móvil puedes imprimir fotos de la cámara del móvil con todos los filtros y retoques necesarios como si fuese una impresora bluetooth. Ante un apuro también sirve para imprimir un par de fotos de carnet por impresión, eso sí, tendrás que ver que salgan a la escala correcta para que coincidan con el tamaño carnet. No tiene memoria, únicamente puedes imprimir o descartar la foto, para eso mejor usar el móvil y usarla como impresora. A los niños les encanta por ser sencilla de usar y poder ver la foto impresa físicamente. Resulta recomendable comprarle una funda para llevar la cámara y algún recambio de fotos."

I liked the product but the cartridge inside the camera was stuck when i took out the first print and hence entire cartridge got ruined. Can u send me a replacement cartridge only?; ; Every thing perfect about this product; DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT VERY VERY BAD QUALITY WASTE OF MONEY

++ I have been using instant cameras for a while hence choose Kodak in India as the photo sheets were easily available but that was a mistake

++ pathetic picture quality - I choose two of these kodak cameras as gifts to my nieces and now m so embarrassed as when they clicked pictures ( in day light and night ) I saw the horrible quality product which i got them as gift.

++The product is well build but do not go by pictures on the site its misleading \\

++ I cannot get my money refunded as they do not have return policy - of course why ...since they are selling a bad product; Away from this digital world where we can easily delete the pictures I always wanted a mini Polaroid camera to click and create amazing moments and memories and print instantly... And this camera is something which i loved and wanted from a long time... The compact looks and a good quality instant print adds a lot of value for the money that we spend... Thanks Kodak for making such a wonderful product... Loved using it!; ; Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing device but if you have a phone with a decent camera you should buy the Kodak 4 pass mini printer instead as you'll never end up using the camera aspect of this camera.; As the product is superb in quality of printing pictures, but the camera pixels is very low and the most disappointing thing is its battery backup. I can't print more than 5 photos in one full charge and even the camera is draining the battery when it is not in use; Very important to mention what I've called a quasi instant functionality. Unlike real instant cameras where you can make unintentional clicks and accidental photos (and even when it is intentional - it is not always what you've expected), here you are prevented from that. You are taking the picture, see the intermediate result on a tiny screen and only then you can print it if you want. If not - you can retake it, no film wasted. This is a perfect process for me.

Printing speed is very good (I read some complaints about that and don't get it), quality of the photo is very decent. Of cause, it is not a perfect full scale printing. But what could you expect from such a tiny box? It also adds that old-stile, less-technology, analogue vibe. The lack of internal storage - I think it is a plus. Otherwise, it is just a digital camera, but you already have a way more sophisticated one in your phone. And you can connect it and print from the phone.

We did just one cartridge, but I'me sure we will be shooting a lot on this camera.; This printer is not fast, as it does the four pass print. But the photos come out so good. I also have another brand mini photo printer and the quality of the Kodak is so much better. The only problem I have is the battery drains so fast, like after just a few printings. And the on switch takes several attempts to finally turn on, you have to hold your tongue a certain way I think 🤔. I've had an older models of this printer and never had either of these problems with them. Still, I prefer the prints from this printer over the other brand I have by far. And the app you download to use it is super user friendly and allows for editing, frames, collages and more.; Es una cámara muy buena, la calidad de las fotos dependen mas de la calidad del archivo que de la cámara, su lente es baste bajo o de gama baja te va a ser más útil de impresiona que de cámara en si. Pero si sabes de fotografía te resuelves el problema fácil, en resumen vale mucho la pena en verdad. Es increíble; Taşınabilir baskı makinesi olarak kullanıyorum baskı kalitesi çok iyi telefondan çekip bundan baskı alıyorum kendi kamerası da iyi fakat bazı durumlarda yetersiz kalıyor genel olarak 5/5; Lo bueno es poder imprimiras fotos desde la galería del teléfono móvil a travéz del bluetoot lo malo la calidad de las fotos no es tan buena"

Built-in flash, recommended using 1 AAA alkaline battery and the flash has 10-15 seconds recycle time, it’s perfect for night time or party shoot. (AAA battery is not included)","Pretty fun camera to play around with!

It comes with one roll of black and white, 400 ISO film that shoots half frame photos. The roll comes with a total of 18 exposures with two photos each (so total of 36 unique photos).

The camera itself is a definite throwback to the 90s, where everyone I knew had one of these or one of those disposable ones.

Usage is fairly straightforward - load the film, wind it, and snap photos.

There is a flash which is activated via the toggle switch located at the front of the camera.

This is a fixed focus camera with an aperture of 5.6. Coupled with the 400 ISO film, this camera should yield good photos in daytime and outdoor conditions, or well lit indoor areas as well.

There's an instruction manual included that provides some basic pointers as well.

Fun novelty item.... now I just need to find a place that still develops film!; Cute little camera but feels just like a little disposable camera. Wish it was a little more durable.
Decent for price though; Very reasonably priced so didn’t expect much it’s for my college age granddaughter. Hope she liked it. She asked for this specific one!; This is a very unique camera--particularly in a world where there area so many excellent digital photo/video options. First off, it looks very retro--and that's appropriate for a camera that uses actual 35 mm film! But wait--there's more: the camera takes half sized photos. That's 18×24mm for those of you scoring at home. The first roll of film (18 exposures) is bundled but the rest is up to you. You'll also need a AAA battery which is not included. To their credit, they make abundantly clear that the battery isn't included.

It's a fun camera to shoot and a vivid reminder of how far we've come in terms of photo equipment. It wasn't *that* long ago where camera equipment was expensive. Even basic Instamatic type cameras weren't cheap. Now everyone has a higher quality camera on their phone--and with some phones the camera is state of the art. Now I just need to figure out where to get it developed, something I haven't thought about in well over a decade. Recommended!; While this product does bring back memories, I did have problems with the door for putting the film in the camera. It is very difficult to open. Other than that, the camera is simple to operate and as expected. It's fun to take film in to get developed again!"

Short review: Excellent, crazy fun camera. Pick one up!

Long, drawn out review: Buy one! The Reto Ultra Wide and Slim is a hoot to carry and shoot with. Super light and unobtrusive to carry anywhere. I did not understand the hype of the previous incarnations of this camera until I ran a few rolls through it. Super fun! You outta purchase one!

I am still waiting on the lab to send my film back, maybe this week. I am quite familiar with the lo-fi/ Lomo aesthetic in film photography (Holga's, Dianas, pinhole, 110 format, etc.), but I expect to be pleasantly surprised by the results of the RUWS. The results of this camera view online are compelling, if my shots are half as good I will be over the moon.

Even though I wish this camera had multiple exposure capability, and a hotshoe, and some exposure control, and on and on; I know in my heart it would ruin the experience. This is about as basic as it gets (a box that holds film) and it is up to me to use my skills and creativity as a photographer to create worthwhile photos. BTW, get one. No home should be without a RUWS!

Even though I have a number of cameras at my disposal, the RUWS most certainly will get the nod often. You should get one! Steal it if you must, lol.

In closing, just do it already. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.; Every roll of film I used in this camera was ruined or blank. The camera simply doesn’t work at all. I spent lots of money mailing film to be developed and both the camera and that process was a waste. Don’t buy this camera. I’ve tried many things to make it work and it just doesn’t.; Works perfectly; È un accessorio, carino, colorato, effetto retro sia nel design che nella resa degli scatti.

Theres no cover for the front shutter - it's always open.
It's almost the size of an Instax Mini 90 Neo - but a bit smaller in width.
It uses the same film as other Instax Mini cameras, so that's a big plus. You can preview the pic and edit it with various basic filters before printing it. The filters are printed only on the films printable area and not on the borders. However, as of now, you can not edit a pic if you're printing from a phone wirelessly.
(Edit Aug2020 - you can now edit the picture when printing it wirelessly via a mobile. The app got updated so thats good)
I would definitely recommend going for this one since it has an option to save pictures onto a memory card and print later or connect to your phone and print any picture you want from that. Removes the chance of printing a dark or over exposed pic since you can first view the shot and then print, or print a pic you took earlier.
All in all a great camera+printer. But dont expect exceptional photo details/quality.; Looks cool, decent battery life and easy to carry around. Won’t fit in your pocket but is still travel convenient. Photo quality is what you would expect from a film camera. Cartridge can hold 20 film sheets at a time which is standard; Good product; I gifted this to my wife and she absolutely loved it!!! The photo printing capability from smartphone is just amazing. The quality of the photos are really very good. The camera is not upto the mark when compared with today's smartphone cameras but they are decent at this price point.

There are other features in this device (like remote shooting, audio in photo) which I haven't tried yet but they seem really cool as well. Overall, an excellent device at 10.5K!; I am in love with this camera. The picture quality clicked directly with this camera is really nice for its megapixel and the direct printing option is amazing. I wish there the app would allow more edits on direct printing but overall this has fulfilled everything i wanted😊; Quality of picture is really good. We tried both clicking directly from cam and printing from mobile phone . It worked for my 16 year old daughter as well in one go.; Amazing printer and versatile camera. I was actually wanting to buy a printer for instant print but got two in one. Camera quality decent, print quality good. Best part it can take print out of pics taken on mobile too.; easy to use.
picture quality is good
the size of photo is like visiting cards.
if you likes square size of your photos then u go for sq 10.; Lo mejor de esta cámara es que puedes ver las fotos antes de imprimirlas, incluso puedes usarla de impresora de fotos que tengas en tu celular, es la combinación perfecta entre cámara digital e impresora de fotos al estilo polaroid, funciona con los mismos cartuchos de la instax mini, incluso incluye una app para poder imprimir las fotos desde tu celular o transferirte las fotos impresas al teléfono, además se puede colocar una tarjeta SD y pasarte las fotos a la computadora, la calidad de las fotos es buena, no como una cámara profesional pero si mejor que la instax mini, además que tiene flash y la opción de grabar audios en las fotos, las cuales se imprimirán con un QR para poder escanearlas y oírlas, realmente vale la pena y no gastas hojas del cartucho porque puedes revisar las fotos antes de imprimirlas.; Es sencilla y práctica de usar, además puede guardar varias fotografías en la memoria interna o una Micro SD (no incluida) y permite imprimir de tú teléfono, haciendo que si no te termina de convencer del todo la calidad de la cámara, podrás imprimir de un equipo propio que tenga mejor lente, por último, puedes hacer ediciones bonitas con los marcos incluidos o si tienes tiempo y dedicación, hacerte unos propios.; I reviewed a number of instant cameras before settling on this one. It is easy to use one handed and has fun features like frames, moustaches, horns if you want them. I like the quality of the prints having previously used a zink paper printer. Bought through Warehouse, so the discount was the final push.; Mir gefällt die Kamera super auch das man es wenn es gut aussieht sofort ausdrucken kann. Meinen Kindern gefällt es auch Fotos zu machen.; Nice value for money instax camera! Gives the best pictures when you having good lighting.
Also really nice is that it has a bluetooth function which you can send pictures to print them via the camera!
Only downside is that it sometimes cannot take the filmrol (a new one). It keeps saying that you need to apply a new film rol in it."

It works brilliantly. With practice she'll figure out the settings.
Will update review with more views. Pretty pleased with the film size. The instax mini line films are too small for my liking.
There was one con(so far), if you load the film, it pops out a black cover of the film cartridge. Don't open the camera once that happens, or else, the next time you close the flap, it will waste a film for ""trial"" and you will get an all black wasted instant film.; One can choose whether to print or not also can share images from mobile or camera and print it. Brightness can be adjusted before printing . All these features make this model the best in polaroids.; It is a very good camera with very good features and above all has a good picture quality even in dark.; picture quality isnt that great.i found pictures a bit more bright and less colorful.its easy to use. ignore purple marks as picture was crushed by my nephew 😅😂; Superb cute thing; I like it very much... picture quality is awesome..; Hi all. I've been a Polaroid nut for ages now. And was very excited for the launch of SQ20 in inida. Once I finally had it I immediately notice serious color accuracy mismatch. If you own a instax mini you'll for sure find its photos more lively. SQ not only prints not so very sharp photos but also what you click is a far cry from what prints. Darks get really dull and the overall tone is amiss. Whites get washed.

Great concept but prints need work; Pathetic quality of the prints.; llevo ya mas de dos años con el producto y ninguna queja tiene una función ""secreta"" donde puedes imprimir cualquier foto aunque no sea tomada con la cámara; The best thing about it is that you can choose the photo to print so you don't waste your expensive films.; La compre en preventa (ya que no estaba disponible desde hace meses, no entiendo por qué) y tardo pocos días en llegar. En cuanto a la calidad de la cámara diría que dentro de la gama híbrida es la más completa, no esperéis una calidad de imagen digital dentro del LCD que sea impecable, ya que no es lo que más destaca dentro de este producto. Lo mejor de ella es el poder seleccionar la imagen que quieres revelar antes de hacerlo, además de poder editarla al momento, o grabar un vídeo y seleccionar un frame, además, puedes transferir imágenes editadas previamente en el ordenador a una microSD e insertarla en la cámara para posteriormente revelarla en la película. Considero que es la cámara perfecta para quienes buscan su primera cámara instantánea. La única pega es que se aprecia un contraste muy elevado en comparación a cómo se previsualiza en el LCD, pero bueno, PANTALLAS, nunca podremos conseguir una imagen revelada exactamente igual a lo que previsualizamos en un soporte digital.; Lately I decided that I wanted to buy an instant camera so I did a very good research before I buy the instax sq20. So, this instax camera is a hybrid camera which means that you can take a photo but is not printed instantly (unless you choose to), and therefore you can navigate through the photos you ve taken via the LCD screen and select the one you want to print. I believe the main reason I decided to buy a hybrid camera is because I wanted to have the choice of printing the photos I wanted without spending film with dark or bad photos. I am not a professional photographer so for me this was a must. It is a digital camera of I think 3.8Mp which means that the quality of the photos are not the best, but you notice it only when you see them on the computer. I have it for almost two weeks now and I am super excited with my purchase! The photos are amazing and you don't really notice the 3.8mp on the small square frames. If you play a bit with the options regarding the lighting, exposure, zoom, filters etc I am sure you are going to find the best combination of features you need in order to print a very nice and memorable pic. I was quite frustrated that this was not included in the top lists of the best instax cameras but probably this happened because it would't be fair to compare a hybrid to a pure instant camera! Another thing I liked about this camera was the square film which comparing to the mini ones works better for me! I would totally recommend this camera 📸 😊; So...the kid had been begging for an instant camera since her birthday in February 2019. She got one for Christmas as it was after her birthday we realised just how much she wanted one of these.
She is about to turn 7, so we wanted something sturdy, easy to use but above all else, fun.
Enter the SQ20!
First: this is very easy to work and the kid absolutely nailed it (even going so far as to take a crazy selfie or twelve.)
Next: the print quality is better than expected, although outside in natural sunlight did work better for this, as we had a feeling it might.
Last: the price of film...these can be pricey, but if you shop around there are deals that can be found. Advice: 100 shots for £99.
This can be done for £93 if you are savvy when buying.
Pretty sure there are cheaper ways too so don’t only hold me to that one. Luckily little legs was bought film by just about everyone and she now has about 160 left waiting to be taken!
She’s happy, we’re happy-would recommend as a camera for just about all ages as I myself have also tinkered with it!"

I liked the product but the cartridge inside the camera was stuck when i took out the first print and hence entire cartridge got ruined. Can u send me a replacement cartridge only?; ; Every thing perfect about this product; DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT VERY VERY BAD QUALITY WASTE OF MONEY

++ I have been using instant cameras for a while hence choose Kodak in India as the photo sheets were easily available but that was a mistake

++ pathetic picture quality - I choose two of these kodak cameras as gifts to my nieces and now m so embarrassed as when they clicked pictures ( in day light and night ) I saw the horrible quality product which i got them as gift.

++The product is well build but do not go by pictures on the site its misleading \\

++ I cannot get my money refunded as they do not have return policy - of course why ...since they are selling a bad product; Away from this digital world where we can easily delete the pictures I always wanted a mini Polaroid camera to click and create amazing moments and memories and print instantly... And this camera is something which i loved and wanted from a long time... The compact looks and a good quality instant print adds a lot of value for the money that we spend... Thanks Kodak for making such a wonderful product... Loved using it!; ; Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing device but if you have a phone with a decent camera you should buy the Kodak 4 pass mini printer instead as you'll never end up using the camera aspect of this camera.; As the product is superb in quality of printing pictures, but the camera pixels is very low and the most disappointing thing is its battery backup. I can't print more than 5 photos in one full charge and even the camera is draining the battery when it is not in use; Very important to mention what I've called a quasi instant functionality. Unlike real instant cameras where you can make unintentional clicks and accidental photos (and even when it is intentional - it is not always what you've expected), here you are prevented from that. You are taking the picture, see the intermediate result on a tiny screen and only then you can print it if you want. If not - you can retake it, no film wasted. This is a perfect process for me.

Printing speed is very good (I read some complaints about that and don't get it), quality of the photo is very decent. Of cause, it is not a perfect full scale printing. But what could you expect from such a tiny box? It also adds that old-stile, less-technology, analogue vibe. The lack of internal storage - I think it is a plus. Otherwise, it is just a digital camera, but you already have a way more sophisticated one in your phone. And you can connect it and print from the phone.

We did just one cartridge, but I'me sure we will be shooting a lot on this camera.; This printer is not fast, as it does the four pass print. But the photos come out so good. I also have another brand mini photo printer and the quality of the Kodak is so much better. The only problem I have is the battery drains so fast, like after just a few printings. And the on switch takes several attempts to finally turn on, you have to hold your tongue a certain way I think 🤔. I've had an older models of this printer and never had either of these problems with them. Still, I prefer the prints from this printer over the other brand I have by far. And the app you download to use it is super user friendly and allows for editing, frames, collages and more.; Es una cámara muy buena, la calidad de las fotos dependen mas de la calidad del archivo que de la cámara, su lente es baste bajo o de gama baja te va a ser más útil de impresiona que de cámara en si.

The camera works perfectly fine. Prints good quality images and will also record a voice QR for your memorable behind the scene giggles and joys. Do not expect the picture quality of the highest standards, this is meant to keep your moments in a print format as it occurs. Not everyone may like it a lot due to the individual pictures price. But to me capturing pictures and the joy of getting an instant image is far greater. Combo package gives you an option of instantly keeping your photos into. The fridge magnets are another good way to show your memories to the visitors. Though placing the magnet is a bit tricky.
I was looking at the Instax mini 11 before looking into pros and cons of both. Then this seemed like a better option for few extra bucks (with all the offers I got it for 10.4k approx).
*Give a thumbs-up if you like the review.; Easy to use, The print quality (from phone) is really good. Camera picture quality gets slightly out of focus/ undefined but decent when close to subject (the sound recording and frame option is only available in camera picture). One advantage of camera picture is that it doesn't print immediately, you can retake pics and choose the best to print - you can avoid under/over exposure this way (the rest can be stored in SD card). The photo book quality that comes along with this pack isn't great, so i bought another one. Over-all happy with my purchase.; Good packaging . Good quality . Go for it; Best in Instax mini Model.; The camera clarity is not at all good, though it can be used as a printer as it provides convenience of printing, one should rather go for only printer version from Fuji instead of camera; No doubt . .

Everything fit together just as it was supposed to. I have not attempted to use the camera as of yet, but I will come back and edit my review once I do. This review is strictly for the build and quality of the build. There were some issues that I had to deal with:

- Instructions: The major issue I had was that the manual that comes in the box is in Chinese. There is no English whatsoever. I knew this was an issue before I ordered this camera and it is true; you can find the English instructions online. I ended up using the Chinese only instructions more than the English version because the pictures were much clearer. The English instructions helped me to make sure I wasn't doing something backwards. However, the English instructions are translated from the Chinese and do not always make the most sense. I would really advise anyone who isn't handy or good at putting things together or solving problems to stay away from this product. I am fairly competent in all of those things and more and there were times when I had to undo what I had just done because the instructions were hard to decipher at times.

- Screws: There are 3 types of screws: flat-top, capped, and regular. Sometimes the instructions tell you when to use the capped screws and sometimes they just say to use a screw (meaning the regular screws) when in actuality you are supposed to use a capped screw. However, you can kind of figure out which ones need to go where by looking at the pictures in the instructions and also just through figuring out what should and shouldn't be. This could be troublesome if you are not good at this stuff. This might help: for the most part the regular screws were used in the construction of the body while the capped screws were used for moving parts.

The screws are very small so you will need a set of small screwdrivers. The kind used for electronics and jewelry. The regular screws are a little hard to screw in all the way so definitely make sure the screwdriver fits so they don't get stripped. Do not over tighten anything!

- Be Gentle: This camera is all plastic. It doesn't feel cheap or flimsy, but it is plastic so be careful of flexing it too much and snapping bits and pieces. There was a time or two I came close to bending something too much and possibly close to breaking it, but that was my fault. I ended up loosening parts so I wouldn't have to bend it or flex it. All of the pieces did fit together perfectly (I did have to cut off a couple plastic ""tags"" left on some of the pieces. If you build models you know what I'm talking about).

- Be Patient: With the issue of the instructions and the fact it is a plastic product, just remember to take your time and enjoy the build. I would say that this DIY camera is more for the people that enjoy building stuff and not really for someone that wants or needs this type of camera. If you want a TLR go buy one. This is not a super nice professionally made camera and it never will be. It's more of just a fun project that can give you a camera to experiment with.

All in all, the product that I received far exceeded my expectations. It was a fun project that took about 2-3 hours to build. It seems to be pretty sturdy even though it is plastic. If it is able to take decent photos, I will be amazed, but there is no reason as of yet that I should doubt that it won't take good photos. I was able to actually bring stuff into focus through the viewfinder. Although the DIY camera is not for everyone, I highly recommend it to other tinkerers, model builders, and do-it-yourselfers. Hey DIY... Do-It-Yourselfer... cool.; Okay so I wasn't paid to write this. Seriously, why can't I be one of those people who get paid to leave reviews? Anyway. the instructions for this camera are NOT in English. I knew that coming into this because I read other reviews. Let me help you out... download Google Translate on your phone. Select the camera option to translate. When you aim the camera (on your phone.. not the one you are putting together) at the text, it will translate it to English. BAM! problem solved. I know some people will not want to put forth this effort, but as a person who owns an antique Rolleiflex Camera (that still works), I thought it would be delightful to put together my own twin lens camera. Be patient and use google translate! :) even better just Google this camera and viola. The whole manual is on a pdf file in English.; The camera kit I got came with both English and Chinese instructions. However the English Instructions were so small, I needed a magnifying to read them. I referenced the images in the Chinese instructions because some parts were hard to identify. It takes a couple of hours to build and you will need tweezers, and a small Philips to put this together. It's definitely not for kids or someone with poor fine motor control. The resulting Camera works but is kind of Crappy, the viewfinder is very soft and winding the film requires just pulling it along. I wasn't sure how far it pulled the film. I had fun putting it together but I doubt I will use the camera again.; No screw driver included, or english instructions. No customer support, they just sent me to Amazon support who were just as confused as I was. The English translation wasn't great, but if you're handy (or know someone who is) it's doable but a little frustrating. Excited to see how (if) the film turns out! The camera itself has a few quirks, but for $25 and made out of plastic that's to be expected. I expect quite a few light leaks which some people really like cuz it adds extra ""character"" to the finished photo.; I read all the bad reviews thinking maybe they just got a bad batch or didn't know what they were doing but my camera had a few missing parts and most of the parts didn't even fit well together. Do not recommend"

Happy customer!

Short review: Excellent, crazy fun camera. Pick one up!

Long, drawn out review: Buy one! The Reto Ultra Wide and Slim is a hoot to carry and shoot with. Super light and unobtrusive to carry anywhere. I did not understand the hype of the previous incarnations of this camera until I ran a few rolls through it. Super fun! You outta purchase one!

I am still waiting on the lab to send my film back, maybe this week. I am quite familiar with the lo-fi/ Lomo aesthetic in film photography (Holga's, Dianas, pinhole, 110 format, etc.), but I expect to be pleasantly surprised by the results of the RUWS. The results of this camera view online are compelling, if my shots are half as good I will be over the moon.

Even though I wish this camera had multiple exposure capability, and a hotshoe, and some exposure control, and on and on; I know in my heart it would ruin the experience. This is about as basic as it gets (a box that holds film) and it is up to me to use my skills and creativity as a photographer to create worthwhile photos. BTW, get one. No home should be without a RUWS!

Even though I have a number of cameras at my disposal, the RUWS most certainly will get the nod often. You should get one! Steal it if you must, lol.

In closing, just do it already. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.; Every roll of film I used in this camera was ruined or blank. The camera simply doesn’t work at all. I spent lots of money mailing film to be developed and both the camera and that process was a waste. Don’t buy this camera. I’ve tried many things to make it work and it just doesn’t.; Works perfectly; È un accessorio, carino, colorato, effetto retro sia nel design che nella resa degli scatti. Non ne caverete però immagini tecnicamente soddisfacenti, escono tutte scure anche scattate in piena luce. Con il costo che hanno oggi le pellicole, è meglio usarle con macchine dignitose e non delle macchinette come queste. Qualità costruttiva un po' scadente, costa poco e vale poco, che dire. Carinissima come soprammobile.; No por nada el modelo original (vivitar) se convirtio de culto. Su tamaño compacto, su gran angular, y facil uso la vuelve ideal para el que arranca con film. Super rapida de usar, te olvidas del enfoque, solo requieres saber exponer. Idealmente usar fotometro, pero si no es el caso podras hacerlo facil con la regla ""sunny 16"" buscalo! A la mia la modifique para poder usar filtros nd de 37mm y asi poder tener una exposicion mucho mas amplia y usable sin que obstruya el visor. No pesa nada!"

Aperture: F133.; <b>Film to Use:</b> Accommodate all 120 format films. The use of exposure speed ASA 100 films on sunny days and ASA 400 on cloudy days or indoor occasions is recommended.; <b>Two different Frame Size Masks:</b> one is for 8 frames of 6x9 cm each per roll and another is for 6 frames of 6x12 cm each per roll.; Multiple-Exposures Effect: As the film is advanced manually, the camera can help achieve special effects through multiple exposures by NOT advancing the film after a frame has been exposed. Each depression of the Shutter Release Button will bring about another exposure.","Great light weight camera, easy to use, quirky, and FRAGILE dont drop it. One gripe is that when using a shutter release cable, it only opens the door about 98%, I tried with multiple cables. I made a tiny spacer to make it fully open. Its ok if you dont do this, you just get one side darker than the other around the edge. No issues with the 6x9 mask.; Lomography, altro non vè da dire; The Holga 120WPC is a classic pinhole camera. I gave it 3 stars for image quality, but it’s a pinhole camera and you should expect soft images - definitely NOT digital sharpness. The bubble level and cable release abilities are a step above a Diana F+. You get this camera for the wide image ability. Hopefully they have started to make them again. If not - look for one in the used market and expect to pay a lot more!; The camera is fabulous - exactly what I wanted. But I'm also very impressed by the seller's customer service. One of the frame size masks was missing from my camera, so I wrote to the seller. And within a few days, I received an entirely new camera with both of the frame size masks - no exchange, a whole new camera! So I appreciate that and want to recommend both the cool little crazy camera and the fabulous seller!; So far so good, I’ve developed my first roll, and ended up with some unintended overlapping double exposures. Some things to note to avoid my mistake. The window on the back of the camera is marked with a 16 or a 12. If you want 6x9 negatives, point the arrow at the 16. If you want 6x12 then point the arrow at the 12. Be sure to put the correct insert. Something that isn’t explicitly stated in the directions is this; winding the film to the next number in the window will only move half the frame. You need to wind two numbers, essentially hitting all odd numbers. I realized this once the number 9 showed up in the window. I only got one good frame with no double exposure. That frame was perfectly sharp and totally beautiful. Can’t wait for roll number 2!"

La cámara es pequeña y, en mi caso que la compré blanca, simula bien las antiguas cámaras polaroid.
No es una cámara que uses para sacar fotos a tutiplen, sino su principal función es ""Captar momentos"". Y con esos momentos no me refiero a sesiones de fotos como las que se hacen con las canon y demás.
La caja viene con una cuerdita para la muñeca para evitar que se te caiga y un cable que, en mi caso, no servía. He tenido que utilizar el cargador del móvil. También viene con un manual de instrucciones, eso sí, en ingles. Importante decir que no viene con películas para hacer las fotos.
Las fotos salen preciosas si tienes en cuenta todas las instrucciones que te dan, pero un gran contra es el precio: 16€ solamente 8 películas para fotos, siendo 2€ cada foto prácticamente.
Igualmente, yo estoy encantado, porque ofrece un aire vintage que te quedas embobado viéndolo.; Tolle Kamera. Die Filme Kosten zwar ordentlich aber die Qualität ist super. Vor allem haben die Fotos ein schönes Format und sind nicht so winzig wie bei der instax; This is the first time I have owned and used a Polaroid instant camera; this one comes nicely boxed with the camera itself, quick start guide, usb-c cable and a wrist strap. You need film which is sold separately; I got the “Polaroid 6009 Color Film for i-Type” film which is £27.99 for 16 shots/exposures. The cost can add up very quickly being each photo at £1.74 each; however I enjoyed the experience with the physical photos which you don’t get instantly with camera phones and DSLRS. This camera has various features such as self timer and double exposure mode allowing you to get creative.

This camera is compatible with i-Type film and 600 film which are both sold separately; the films do come in various colours and designs on them too. Also you can purchase various accessories for the camera too such as a case.

Two things:
1) WATCH OUT FOR THE BULB SETTING! This can get knocked on very easily. I didn't realize it was, and I don't know how long it was on for. This can result in very overexposed pictures. Tape it to the N position.

2) I feel like an idiot... but be careful with the lens cap. Consider not using one. What you see through the viewfinder is nothing to do with what the camera ""sees"" through the lens. I'm not used to this. So I left the lens cap on several times after ""composing"" my picture. You can't see that it's on there. Finally I threw it out. I had taped up the camera and not having a lens cap didn't produce any light leaks. I kept the camera in my camera bag though."

I liked the product but the cartridge inside the camera was stuck when i took out the first print and hence entire cartridge got ruined. Can u send me a replacement cartridge only?; ; Every thing perfect about this product; DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT VERY VERY BAD QUALITY WASTE OF MONEY

++ I have been using instant cameras for a while hence choose Kodak in India as the photo sheets were easily available but that was a mistake

++ pathetic picture quality - I choose two of these kodak cameras as gifts to my nieces and now m so embarrassed as when they clicked pictures ( in day light and night ) I saw the horrible quality product which i got them as gift.

++The product is well build but do not go by pictures on the site its misleading \\

++ I cannot get my money refunded as they do not have return policy - of course why ...since they are selling a bad product; Away from this digital world where we can easily delete the pictures I always wanted a mini Polaroid camera to click and create amazing moments and memories and print instantly... And this camera is something which i loved and wanted from a long time... The compact looks and a good quality instant print adds a lot of value for the money that we spend... Thanks Kodak for making such a wonderful product... Loved using it!; ; Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing device but if you have a phone with a decent camera you should buy the Kodak 4 pass mini printer instead as you'll never end up using the camera aspect of this camera.; As the product is superb in quality of printing pictures, but the camera pixels is very low and the most disappointing thing is its battery backup. I can't print more than 5 photos in one full charge and even the camera is draining the battery when it is not in use; Very important to mention what I've called a quasi instant functionality. Unlike real instant cameras where you can make unintentional clicks and accidental photos (and even when it is intentional - it is not always what you've expected), here you are prevented from that. You are taking the picture, see the intermediate result on a tiny screen and only then you can print it if you want. If not - you can retake it, no film wasted. This is a perfect process for me.

Printing speed is very good (I read some complaints about that and don't get it), quality of the photo is very decent. Of cause, it is not a perfect full scale printing. But what could you expect from such a tiny box? It also adds that old-stile, less-technology, analogue vibe. The lack of internal storage - I think it is a plus. Otherwise, it is just a digital camera, but you already have a way more sophisticated one in your phone. And you can connect it and print from the phone.

We did just one cartridge, but I'me sure we will be shooting a lot on this camera.; This printer is not fast, as it does the four pass print. But the photos come out so good. I also have another brand mini photo printer and the quality of the Kodak is so much better. The only problem I have is the battery drains so fast, like after just a few printings. And the on switch takes several attempts to finally turn on, you have to hold your tongue a certain way I think 🤔. I've had an older models of this printer and never had either of these problems with them. Still, I prefer the prints from this printer over the other brand I have by far. And the app you download to use it is super user friendly and allows for editing, frames, collages and more.; Es una cámara muy buena, la calidad de las fotos dependen mas de la calidad del archivo que de la cámara, su lente es baste bajo o de gama baja te va a ser más útil de impresiona que de cámara en si. Pero si sabes de fotografía te resuelves el problema fácil, en resumen vale mucho la pena en verdad. Es increíble; Taşınabilir baskı makinesi olarak kullanıyorum baskı kalitesi çok iyi telefondan çekip bundan baskı alıyorum kendi kamerası da iyi fakat bazı durumlarda yetersiz kalıyor genel olarak 5/5; Lo bueno es poder imprimiras fotos desde la galería del teléfono móvil a travéz del bluetoot lo malo la calidad de las fotos no es tan buena"

Produces good colors; Print quality is very good with photos taken from mobile..but camer inbuilt camera is not that good; Rather than looking at it as a camera printer, consider it a printer camera. Because you may not be using the camera as often due to inherent limitations of instant cameras.; The product stopped working in 2 months; I was confused between Kodak and Fujifilm but ended up taking this and am very satisfied. My reasons for purchase were:
1. Brand image
2. Amazing process of printing
3. Best option in this price range
4. Lower cost of film roll compared to Fujifilm; I bought it for my anniversary picture and I am very happy with the product.The ease of access and the print quality is good.Only thing which can be improved is Kodak can give a larger screen and it becomes difficult to guess the exact background.
Pros-Photo filter for variation in photography,Can be paired with mobile and act as a printer,laminated insta pictures for better longer life
Cons-LCD screen size and quality can be improved,Little bit heavy
My verdict-One of the best insta camera.; Picture quality is not that great. Better with mobile photos. Easy & fun to use.; I actually buy this camera due to good review about picture quality but in actual print quality of photo very bad not as expected. Genuinely I feel like it's a waste of money...; Ótimo produto; During the year of use, I took 40 photos, some of them were spoiled by the camera, but in general, it is a very wonderful thing that will bring you a lot of good emotions.; Me agrada que no solo cumple con tomar fotos sino como una impresora de ellas, y de muy buena calidad.
La autonomía de la batería queda un poco corta pero sigue siendo un gran producto, solo tengan cuidado cuando inserten los cartuchos ya que se puede arruinar el mismo.; I rarely write reviews, but upon purchasing and using this product and seeing the onslaught of negative reviews, I had to sit down and type one out.

First, I do not understand the negative reviews. Maybe some critical thinking skills aren't being applied when others have bought this product. You see lots of ""My iPhone/Android camera takes better quality pictures!"" in the complaints. Let's dissect this. Most smartphones nowadays retail for nearly $1,000 in total, and a key element in their advertising is not only the quality of the built in cameras but the constant improves from model to model. Of course, a smart phone camera is going to produce better quality pictures. It's one of the reasons we spend our hard earned money on them. If all we needed was a device to call and text, we'd still be using flip phones. Let's put our thinking caps on and remember why the little computers in our pockets can take excellent if not astounding quality pictures - because they're built to!

Now, this Kodak camera does state it prints ""superior photo"" quality, but it does not boast ""state of the art"" quality or even ""smart phone"" quality, because it knows its place and that would be a flat out lie. Read the fine print, people! Superior does not automatically equate to breathtaking, especially when you look at the product itself. Once again, this is a basic camera/tool. It is not built to be an equal to a smartphone which is essentially, as I said, a mini-computer; It is not built to be an equal to even the lowest tier of professional photography cameras. It IS however, built to be a simple, basic photo taking device that you can also connect to your phone, iPad or other supported device if you choose to.

It does what it says on the box, so I am happy with this purchase. I suspect other customers were expecting something far more complex and souped up, and that is not what this camera is.

Now, the only cons I have for it is that printing process is a little slow, but it takes less than a minute. The paper quality is good though, so I'll let this slide. You can't have everything, especially if you're buying something that is quite budget when it comes to bells and whistles. And that's another thing I'd like to mention - this prints on modern day photo paper. Do not expect the thick, flimsy paper that actual polaroid cameras printed on. If that's what you're after, then you'll be better off heading over to eBay or a pawn shop.

This is a modern take on an old school favorite. Understand what you're buying, and you will be a satisfied customer.; La calidad de las fotos es muy buena y el tamaño es suficientemente grande, a diferencia de otras cámaras instantaneas que te imprimen como mucho tamaño similar al de una foto de carnet. Las funciones que tiene son bastante básicas, pero si lo que buscas es la simplicidad y facilidad de uso de las cámaras instantaneas retro no te hara falta más. Las impresiones son económicas y de buena calidad. Alternativamente con la App de Kodak en el móvil puedes imprimir fotos de la cámara del móvil con todos los filtros y retoques necesarios como si fuese una impresora bluetooth. Ante un apuro también sirve para imprimir un par de fotos de carnet por impresión, eso sí, tendrás que ver que salgan a la escala correcta para que coincidan con el tamaño carnet. No tiene memoria, únicamente puedes imprimir o descartar la foto, para eso mejor usar el móvil y usarla como impresora. A los niños les encanta por ser sencilla de usar y poder ver la foto impresa físicamente. Resulta recomendable comprarle una funda para llevar la cámara y algún recambio de fotos."

Tardó un poco en llegar.; The Fujifilm Instax Mini EVO Instant Camera is a delightful blend of nostalgia and modern innovation. Here's why I love it:

Pros:
- Innovative LCD screen for previewing and editing.
- Produces sharp, vibrant prints with ease.
- Offers digital capture alongside traditional instant printing.
- User-friendly design for seamless operation.
- Compact and portable for on-the-go use.

Cons:
- Print cost can add up over time.
- Editing options on the LCD screen are somewhat limited.

Overall, the Fujifilm Instax Mini EVO Instant Camera is a fantastic blend of modern technology and instant gratification, perfect for capturing and sharing memories in a fun and creative way.; As an avid portrait photographer, I typically bring my DSLR with me everywhere. The cons? It’s heavy to lug around and sometimes I forget my battery packs or SD cards (iykyk 😩).

Enter: Fujifilm’s Instax Mini EVO. I totally impulse bought this after seeing it in an Instagram reel 🫣 ahead of me taking a road trip up the PCH. This is honestly one of my favorite camera purchases to date. It’s like a digital x film x mini printer crossover.

You do need to purchase film and a micro SD card separately, but my favorite feature is that you can take as MANY photos as you want and pick which ones you print/delete. It also comes in with pre-built in filters that are fun to mess with but I don’t use often. I recommend purchasing a SD card adapter to easily transfer all images to your phone - this camera does pair to an app but it only lets you transfer the images that you print out and the transferred images have a Polaroid frame. The picture quality is average - it’s exactly what you’d expect for a Polaroid picture. I also love that you can charge it with a USB-C cable (does not take long to charge at all - I think I’ve charged it once since I got it for like an hr and haven’t had to recharge since).

In terms of functionality, this camera is awesome. It’s small, lightweight, fits easily into my bag, and is aesthetically appealing. I take it with me everywhere and definitely recommend making the leap if you’re unsure.; É uma impressora e máquina, vale a pena para quem quer ver as fotos antes de imprimir.; The item arrived on time. It works great!"

I liked the product but the cartridge inside the camera was stuck when i took out the first print and hence entire cartridge got ruined. Can u send me a replacement cartridge only?; ; Every thing perfect about this product; DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT VERY VERY BAD QUALITY WASTE OF MONEY

++ I have been using instant cameras for a while hence choose Kodak in India as the photo sheets were easily available but that was a mistake

++ pathetic picture quality - I choose two of these kodak cameras as gifts to my nieces and now m so embarrassed as when they clicked pictures ( in day light and night ) I saw the horrible quality product which i got them as gift.

++The product is well build but do not go by pictures on the site its misleading \\

++ I cannot get my money refunded as they do not have return policy - of course why ...since they are selling a bad product; Away from this digital world where we can easily delete the pictures I always wanted a mini Polaroid camera to click and create amazing moments and memories and print instantly... And this camera is something which i loved and wanted from a long time... The compact looks and a good quality instant print adds a lot of value for the money that we spend... Thanks Kodak for making such a wonderful product... Loved using it!; ; Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing device but if you have a phone with a decent camera you should buy the Kodak 4 pass mini printer instead as you'll never end up using the camera aspect of this camera.; As the product is superb in quality of printing pictures, but the camera pixels is very low and the most disappointing thing is its battery backup. I can't print more than 5 photos in one full charge and even the camera is draining the battery when it is not in use; Very important to mention what I've called a quasi instant functionality. Unlike real instant cameras where you can make unintentional clicks and accidental photos (and even when it is intentional - it is not always what you've expected), here you are prevented from that. You are taking the picture, see the intermediate result on a tiny screen and only then you can print it if you want. If not - you can retake it, no film wasted. This is a perfect process for me.

Printing speed is very good (I read some complaints about that and don't get it), quality of the photo is very decent. Of cause, it is not a perfect full scale printing. But what could you expect from such a tiny box? It also adds that old-stile, less-technology, analogue vibe. The lack of internal storage - I think it is a plus. Otherwise, it is just a digital camera, but you already have a way more sophisticated one in your phone. And you can connect it and print from the phone.

We did just one cartridge, but I'me sure we will be shooting a lot on this camera.; This printer is not fast, as it does the four pass print. But the photos come out so good. I also have another brand mini photo printer and the quality of the Kodak is so much better. The only problem I have is the battery drains so fast, like after just a few printings. And the on switch takes several attempts to finally turn on, you have to hold your tongue a certain way I think 🤔. I've had an older models of this printer and never had either of these problems with them. Still, I prefer the prints from this printer over the other brand I have by far. And the app you download to use it is super user friendly and allows for editing, frames, collages and more.; Es una cámara muy buena, la calidad de las fotos dependen mas de la calidad del archivo que de la cámara, su lente es baste bajo o de gama baja te va a ser más útil de impresiona que de cámara en si. Pero si sabes de fotografía te resuelves el problema fácil, en resumen vale mucho la pena en verdad. Es increíble; Taşınabilir baskı makinesi olarak kullanıyorum baskı kalitesi çok iyi telefondan çekip bundan baskı alıyorum kendi kamerası da iyi fakat bazı durumlarda yetersiz kalıyor genel olarak 5/5; Lo bueno es poder imprimiras fotos desde la galería del teléfono móvil a travéz del bluetoot lo malo la calidad de las fotos no es tan buena"

Produces good colors; Print quality is very good with photos taken from mobile..but camer inbuilt camera is not that good; Rather than looking at it as a camera printer, consider it a printer camera. Because you may not be using the camera as often due to inherent limitations of instant cameras.; The product stopped working in 2 months; I was confused between Kodak and Fujifilm but ended up taking this and am very satisfied. My reasons for purchase were:
1. Brand image
2. Amazing process of printing
3. Best option in this price range
4. Lower cost of film roll compared to Fujifilm; I bought it for my anniversary picture and I am very happy with the product.The ease of access and the print quality is good.Only thing which can be improved is Kodak can give a larger screen and it becomes difficult to guess the exact background.
Pros-Photo filter for variation in photography,Can be paired with mobile and act as a printer,laminated insta pictures for better longer life
Cons-LCD screen size and quality can be improved,Little bit heavy
My verdict-One of the best insta camera.; Picture quality is not that great. Better with mobile photos. Easy & fun to use.; I actually buy this camera due to good review about picture quality but in actual print quality of photo very bad not as expected. Genuinely I feel like it's a waste of money...; Ótimo produto; During the year of use, I took 40 photos, some of them were spoiled by the camera, but in general, it is a very wonderful thing that will bring you a lot of good emotions.; Me agrada que no solo cumple con tomar fotos sino como una impresora de ellas, y de muy buena calidad.
La autonomía de la batería queda un poco corta pero sigue siendo un gran producto, solo tengan cuidado cuando inserten los cartuchos ya que se puede arruinar el mismo.; I rarely write reviews, but upon purchasing and using this product and seeing the onslaught of negative reviews, I had to sit down and type one out.

First, I do not understand the negative reviews. Maybe some critical thinking skills aren't being applied when others have bought this product. You see lots of ""My iPhone/Android camera takes better quality pictures!"" in the complaints. Let's dissect this. Most smartphones nowadays retail for nearly $1,000 in total, and a key element in their advertising is not only the quality of the built in cameras but the constant improves from model to model. Of course, a smart phone camera is going to produce better quality pictures. It's one of the reasons we spend our hard earned money on them. If all we needed was a device to call and text, we'd still be using flip phones. Let's put our thinking caps on and remember why the little computers in our pockets can take excellent if not astounding quality pictures - because they're built to!

Now, this Kodak camera does state it prints ""superior photo"" quality, but it does not boast ""state of the art"" quality or even ""smart phone"" quality, because it knows its place and that would be a flat out lie. Read the fine print, people! Superior does not automatically equate to breathtaking, especially when you look at the product itself. Once again, this is a basic camera/tool. It is not built to be an equal to a smartphone which is essentially, as I said, a mini-computer; It is not built to be an equal to even the lowest tier of professional photography cameras. It IS however, built to be a simple, basic photo taking device that you can also connect to your phone, iPad or other supported device if you choose to.

It does what it says on the box, so I am happy with this purchase. I suspect other customers were expecting something far more complex and souped up, and that is not what this camera is.

Now, the only cons I have for it is that printing process is a little slow, but it takes less than a minute. The paper quality is good though, so I'll let this slide. You can't have everything, especially if you're buying something that is quite budget when it comes to bells and whistles. And that's another thing I'd like to mention - this prints on modern day photo paper. Do not expect the thick, flimsy paper that actual polaroid cameras printed on. If that's what you're after, then you'll be better off heading over to eBay or a pawn shop.

This is a modern take on an old school favorite. Understand what you're buying, and you will be a satisfied customer.; La calidad de las fotos es muy buena y el tamaño es suficientemente grande, a diferencia de otras cámaras instantaneas que te imprimen como mucho tamaño similar al de una foto de carnet. Las funciones que tiene son bastante básicas, pero si lo que buscas es la simplicidad y facilidad de uso de las cámaras instantaneas retro no te hara falta más. Las impresiones son económicas y de buena calidad. Alternativamente con la App de Kodak en el móvil puedes imprimir fotos de la cámara del móvil con todos los filtros y retoques necesarios como si fuese una impresora bluetooth. Ante un apuro también sirve para imprimir un par de fotos de carnet por impresión, eso sí, tendrás que ver que salgan a la escala correcta para que coincidan con el tamaño carnet. No tiene memoria, únicamente puedes imprimir o descartar la foto, para eso mejor usar el móvil y usarla como impresora. A los niños les encanta por ser sencilla de usar y poder ver la foto impresa físicamente. Resulta recomendable comprarle una funda para llevar la cámara y algún recambio de fotos."
